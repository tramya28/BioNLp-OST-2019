29515476,"In addition previous research has not examined whether state and trait anxiety are independently associated with threat-related biases.",1
29515476,"Methods: We compared ERP waveforms during the processing of emotional faces in a population sample of 58 6-11-year-olds who completed self-reported measures of trait and state anxiety and depression.",0
29515476,"Results: The results showed that the P1 was larger to angry than neutral faces in the left hemisphere though early components (P1 N170) were not strongly associated with child anxiety or depression.",0
29515476,"In contrast Late Positive Potential (LPP) amplitudes to angry (vs. neutral) faces were significantly and positively associated with symptoms of anxiety/depression.",0
29515476,"In addition the difference between LPPs for angry (vs. neutral) faces was independently associated with state and trait anxiety symptoms.",0
29515476,"Discussion: The results showed that neural responses to facial emotion in children with elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression were most evident at later processing stages characterized as evaluative and effortful.",1
29515476,"The findings support cognitive models of threat perception in anxiety and indicate that trait elements of anxiety and more transitory fluctuations in anxious affect are important in understanding individual variation in the neural response to threat in late childhood.",0
21376745,"Amygdala reactivity to threat-related distractor stimuli can be abolished in perceptually demanding contexts.",0
21376745,"Premised on the biological imperative to respond swiftly to threat we demonstrate however that when participants are threatened by shock greater amygdala responses to fearful compared to neutral distractor faces is preserved under conditions of high attentional demand.",0
21376745,"Lateral prefrontal cortices also showed selective responding to fearful distractor faces under these conditions suggesting that threat-related distractor stimuli engaged attentional control mechanisms.",1
21376745,"We conclude that anxiety elicited by looming threat promotes neurocognitive processes that broaden attention and enhance sensitivity to potential danger cues even when perceptual systems are taxed.",1
28985425,"Developing a better understanding of how and under what circumstances alcohol affects the emotions cognitions and neural functions that precede and contribute to dangerous behaviors during intoxication may help to reduce their occurrence.",0
28985425,"Alcohol intoxication has recently been shown to reduce defensive reactivity and anxiety more during uncertain vs certain threat.",1
28985425,"However alcohol's effects on emotionally motivated attention to these threats are unknown.",0
28985425,"Alcohol may disrupt both affective response to and attentional processing of uncertain threats making intoxicated individuals less able to avoid dangerous and costly behaviors.",0
28985425,"To test this possibility we examined the effects of a broad range of blood alcohol concentrations on 96 participants' sub-cortically mediated defensive reactivity (startle potentiation) retrospective subjective anxiety (self-report) and cortically assessed emotionally motivated attention (probe P3 event related potential) while they experienced visually cued uncertain and certain location electric shock threat.",0
28985425,"As predicted alcohol decreased defensive reactivity and subjective anxiety more during uncertain vs certain threat.",1
28985425,"In a novel finding alcohol dampened emotionally motivated attention during uncertain but not certain threat.",0
28985425,"This effect appeared independent of alcohol's effects on defensive reactivity and subjective anxiety.",0
28985425,"These results suggest that alcohol intoxication dampens processing of uncertain threats while leaving processing of certain threats intact.",1
28828218,"BACKGROUND: Mood and anxiety disorders are characterized by altered prefrontal-amygdala function and increased behavioral inhibition (BI) in response to potential threat.",1
28828218,"Whether these alterations constitute a vulnerability or a symptom of illness remains unclear.",0
28828218,"The medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) is thought to play a central role in estimating probability and cost of threat in turn informing selection of subsequent behaviors.",0
28828218,"To better understand the behavioral and neural processes that may be associated with risk for psychopathology we used a virtual reality paradigm to examine behavioral and neural responses of psychiatrically healthy adults with familial history of affective disorders during anticipation of unpredictable threat.",1
28828218,"METHODS: Twenty psychiatrically healthy adults with high familial risk for affective disorders and 20 low-risk matched controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging concurrent with a paradigm in which they explored virtual contexts associated with the threat of shock or safety from shock.",0
28828218,"Subjective anxiety ratings skin conductance exploratory behavior and neural responses were examined for threat versus safe conditions.",1
28828218,"RESULTS: High-risk adults evidenced greater right mOFC activation as well as greater BI compared to low-risk adults.",0
28828218,"There were no significant group differences in subjective ratings or autonomic responses.",0
28828218,"Individuals exhibiting greater activity in the right mOFC showed greater BI and decreased skin conductance response.",0
28828218,"CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that BI and mOFC recruitment during anticipation of aversive outcomes may reflect a vulnerability for affective disorders.",0
28828218,"However such a response may also serve as a compensatory response protecting these high-risk individuals from negative outcomes (i.e. increased physiological arousal).",0
28828218,"These results suggest that the OFC may play a central role in driving threat-related behaviors and thus may be a target for efforts aimed at early detection or prevention.",0
17598732,"Analysis of threat is thought to involve a quick and dirty stage in conjunction with slower processing that is more complete.",0
17598732,"We investigated both types of threat analysis by recording brain potentials in response to threat and neutral words.",1
17598732,"Personality testing was used to identify participants who were either high or low in trait anxiety (TA).",1
17598732,"An observed enhancement of occipital P1 potentials to threat words during an emotional Stroop task was interpreted as a signal of unconscious processing since it was early independent of whether word exposure was subliminal or supraliminal and more prominent the higher the level of TA.",0
17598732,"Later positive potentials were also enhanced for threat versus neutral words but the amplitude enhancement increased with higher TA only in the subliminal condition.",0
17598732,"These results suggest that unconscious analysis of threat is intensified in those prone to anxiety as is a later stage of threat processing subject to dynamic interactions between automatic and strategic influences.",1
27614663,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Given that anxiety runs in families it is critical to understand the cognitive factors that may be responsible for this intergenerational transmission.",0
27614663,"The present study offers a first step by exploring the link between mother and father tendencies to view potentially threatening situations as rapidly escalating toward dreaded outcomes (i.e. looming cognitive style) and the emotional disturbances and looming cognitive styles of their adult offspring.",1
27614663,"METHODS: We assessed cognitive vulnerabilities anxiety and depressive symptoms in a non-clinical sample (N = 382) of Italian college students and their parents.",0
27614663,"RESULTS: The looming cognitive style of fathers but not mothers was significantly related to greater anxiety in adult offspring.",1
27614663,"This finding was obtained for both sons and daughters and remained even after statistically controlling for the anxiety worry depressive symptoms and anxiety sensitivity (AS) of parents).",0
27614663,"Notably the association between fathers' looming cognitive style and offspring symptoms was not related to their child's depressive symptoms and similar to prior work served as a cognitive marker specific to anxiety.",0
27614663,"LIMITATIONS: The present study relied on a cross-sectional design and did not use clients diagnosed with anxiety disorders.",0
27614663,"CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that it may prove fruitful to consider parental vulnerabilities such as looming cognitive styles in comprehensive cognitive and interpersonal models of anxiety.",1
27614663,"The intergenerational transmission of emotional difficulties seems to extend beyond anxiety to beliefs about the escalation of threat.",0
24708496,"Research has indicated that individuals of Asian descent relative to other racial groups demonstrate reduced emotional responding and lower prevalence rates of several anxiety disorders.",0
24708496,"It is unclear though whether these group differences extend to biomarkers of anxiety disorders and whether genetic differences play a role.",1
24708496,"This study compared self-identified Caucasian Latino and Asian persons (total N = 174) on startle response during a baseline period and while anticipating unpredictable threat-a putative biomarker for certain anxiety disorders--as well as predictable threat.",1
24708496,"In addition the association between genetic ancestry and startle response was examined within each racial group to determine potential genetic influences on responding.",0
24708496,"For the baseline period Asian participants exhibited a smaller startle response relative to Caucasian and Latino participants who did not differ.",0
24708496,"Within each racial group genetic ancestry was associated with baseline startle.",1
24708496,"Furthermore genetic ancestry mediated racial group differences in baseline startle.",0
24708496,"For the threat conditions a Race x Condition interaction indicated that Asian participants exhibited reduced startle potentiation to unpredictable but not predicable threat relative to Caucasian and Latino participants who did not differ.",0
24708496,"However genetic ancestry was not associated with threat-potentiated startle in any racial group.",1
24708496,"This study adds to the growing literature on racial differences in emotional responding and provides preliminary evidence suggesting that genetic ancestry may play an important role.",0
24708496,"Moreover reduced sensitivity to unpredictable threat may reflect a mechanism for why individuals of Asian descent are at less risk for particular anxiety disorders relative to other racial groups.",0
