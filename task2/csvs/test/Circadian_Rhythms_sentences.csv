30523071,"Circadian rhythms are endogenously generated recurring patterns of around 24 hours with well-established roles in physiology and behaviour.",
30523071,"These circadian clocks are important in both the aetiology and treatment of various psychiatric and metabolic diseases.",
30523071,"To maintain physiological homeostasis and optimal functioning, living life synchronised to these clocks is desirable; modern society, however, promotes a '24/7' lifestyle where activity often occurs during the body's 'biological night', resulting in mistimed sleep and circadian misalignment.",
30523071,"This circadian desynchrony can increase the risk of disease and can also influence treatment response.",
30523071,"Clinicians should be aware of the influence that circadian desynchrony can have on health and disease, in order to potentially develop new therapeutic strategies and to incorporate chronotherapeutics into current treatment strategies to enhance their utility.",
24132226,"BACKGROUND: Research within the last decade has shown melatonin to have previously-unsuspected beneficial actions on the peripheral reproductive organs.",
24132226,"Likewise, numerous investigations have documented that stable circadian rhythms are also helpful in maintaining reproductive health.",
24132226,"The relationship of melatonin and circadian rhythmicity to maternal and fetal health is summarized in this review.",
24132226,"METHODS: Databases were searched for the related published English literature up to 15 May 2013.",
24132226,"The search terms used in various combinations included melatonin, circadian rhythms, biological clock, suprachiasmatic nucleus, ovary, pregnancy, uterus, placenta, fetus, pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, ischemia-reperfusion, chronodisruption, antioxidants, oxidative stress and free radicals.",
24132226,"The results of the studies uncovered are summarized herein.",
24132226,"RESULTS: Both melatonin and circadian rhythms impact reproduction, especially during pregnancy.",
24132226,"Melatonin is a multifaceted molecule with direct free radical scavenging and indirect antioxidant activities.",
24132226,"Melatonin is produced in both the ovary and in the placenta where it protects against molecular mutilation and cellular dysfunction arising from oxidative/nitrosative stress.",
24132226,"The placenta, in particular, is often a site of excessive free radical generation due to less than optimal adhesion to the uterine wall, which leads to either persistent hypoxia or intermittent hypoxia and reoxygenation, processes that cause massive free radical generation and organ dysfunction.",
24132226,"This may contribute to pre-eclampsia and other disorders which often complicate pregnancy.",
24132226,"Melatonin has ameliorated free radical damage to the placenta and to the fetus in experiments using non-human mammals.",
24132226,"Likewise, the maintenance of a regular maternal light/dark and sleep/wake cycle is important to stabilize circadian rhythms generated by the maternal central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nuclei.",
24132226,"Optimal circadian rhythmicity in the mother is important since her circadian clock, either directly or indirectly via the melatonin rhythm, programs the developing master oscillator of the fetus.",
24132226,"Experimental studies have shown that disturbed maternal circadian rhythms, referred to as chronodisruption, and perturbed melatonin cycles have negative consequences for the maturing fetal oscillators, which may lead to psychological and behavioral problems in the newborn.",
24132226,"To optimize regular circadian rhythms and prevent disturbances of the melatonin cycle during pregnancy, shift work and bright light exposure at night should be avoided, especially during the last trimester of pregnancy.",
24132226,"Finally, melatonin synergizes with oxytocin to promote delivery of the fetus.",
24132226,"Since blood melatonin levels are normally highest during the dark period, the propensity of childbirth to occur at night may relate to the high levels of melatonin at this time which work in concert with oxytocin to enhance the strength of uterine contractions.",
24132226,"CONCLUSIONS: A number of conclusions naturally evolve from the data summarized in this review: (i) melatonin, of both pineal and placental origin, has essential functions in fetal maturation and placenta/uterine homeostasis; (ii) circadian clock genes, which are components of all cells including those in the peripheral reproductive organs, have important roles in reproductive and organismal (fetal and maternal) physiology; (iii) due to the potent antioxidant actions of melatonin, coupled with its virtual absence of toxicity, this indoleamine may have utility in the treatment of pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, placental and fetal ischemia/reperfusion, etc.",
24132226,"(iv) the propensity for parturition to occur at night may relate to the synergism between the nocturnal increase in melatonin and oxytocin.",
28984167,"The insect antennae receive olfactory information from the environment.",
28984167,"In some insects, it has been shown that antennal responsiveness is dynamically regulated by circadian clocks.",
28984167,"However, it is unknown how general this phenomenon is and what functions it serves.",
28984167,"Circadian regulation in honeybee workers is particularly interesting in this regard because they show natural task-related chronobiological plasticity.",
28984167,"Forager bees show strong circadian rhythms in behavior and brain gene expression, whereas nurse bees tend brood around-the-clock and have attenuated circadian rhythms in activity and whole-brain gene expression.",
28984167,"Here, we tested the hypothesis that there is task-related plasticity in circadian rhythms of antennal responsiveness to odorants in worker honeybees.",
28984167,"We used electroantennogram (EAG) to measure the antennal responsiveness of nurses and foragers to general odorants and pheromones around the day.",
28984167,"The capacity to track 10-Hz odorant pulses varied with time of day for both task groups but with different phases.",
28984167,"The antennal pulse-tracking capacity was higher during the subjective day for the day-active foragers, whereas it was better during the night for around-the-clock active nurses.",
28984167,"The task-related phases of pulse-tracking rhythms were similar for all the tested stimuli.",
28984167,"We also found evidence for circadian rhythms in the EAG response magnitude of foragers but not of nurses.",
28984167,"To the best of our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence for circadian regulation of antennal olfactory responsiveness and odorant pulse-tracking capacity in bees or any other hymenopteran insect.",
28984167,"Importantly, our study shows for the first time that the circadian phase of olfactory responsiveness may be socially regulated.",

27736193,"Implanted telemetric devices recorded electrocardiogram continuously for 5 days in conscious wild-type mice (WT, n = 9) and KChIP2(-/-) mice (n = 9) in light:dark periods and in complete darkness.",
27736193,"QT intervals were determined from all RR intervals and corrected for heart rate (QT100 = QT/(RR/100)(1/2)).",
27736193,"Moreover, QT intervals were determined from complexes within the RR range of mean-RR +/- 1% in the individual mouse (QTmean-RR).",
27736193,"We find that RR intervals are 125 +/- 5 ms in WT and 123 +/- 4 ms in KChIP2(-/-) (p = 0.81), and QT intervals are 52 +/- 1 and 52 +/- 1 ms, respectively(p = 0.89).",
27736193,"No ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac deaths were observed.",
27736193,"We find similar diurnal (light:dark) and circadian (darkness) rhythms of RR intervals in WT and KChIP2(-/-) mice.",
27736193,"Circadian rhythms in QT100 intervals are present in both groups, but at physiological small amplitudes: 1.6 +/- 0.2 and 1.0 +/- 0.3 ms in WT and KChIP2(-/-), respectively (p = 0.15).",
27736193,"A diurnal rhythm in QT100 intervals was only found in WT mice.",
27736193,"QTmean-RR intervals display clear diurnal and circadian rhythms in both WT and KChIP2(-/-).",
27736193,"The amplitude of the circadian rhythm in QTmean-RR is 4.0 +/- 0.3 and 3.1 +/- 0.5 ms in WT and KChIP2(-/-), respectively (p = 0.16).",
27736193,"In conclusion, KChIP2 expression does not appear to underlie the circadian rhythm in repolarization duration.",
30784558,"Dysfunction in 24-h circadian rhythms is a common occurrence in ageing adults; however, circadian rhythm disruptions are more severe in people with age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, and Parkinson's disease.",
30784558,"Manifestations of circadian rhythm disruptions differ according to the type and severity of neurodegenerative disease and, for some patients, occur before the onset of typical clinical symptoms of neurodegeneration.",
30784558,"Evidence from preliminary studies suggest that circadian rhythm disruptions, in addition to being a symptom of neurodegeneration, might also be a potential risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, and Parkinson's disease, although large, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this relationship.",
30784558,"The mechanistic link between circadian rhythms and neurodegeneration is still not fully understood, although proposed underlying pathways include alterations of protein homoeostasis and immune and inflammatory function.",
30784558,"While preliminary clinical studies are promising, more studies of circadian rhythm disruptions and its mechanisms are required.",
30784558,"Furthermore, clinical trials are needed to determine whether circadian interventions could prevent or delay the onset of neurodegenerative diseases.",

29953265,"The observation that a biological or physiological variable shows a circadian rhythm can be explained by several multifactorial systems including external (exogenous), internal (endogenous) and psychobiological (lifestyle) mechanisms.",
29953265,"Our body clock can be synchronized with the environment by external factors, called synchronizers, i.e.",
