21242990,"Exposure to severe stressors increases the risk for psychiatric disorders in vulnerable individuals, but can lead to positive outcomes for others.",
21242990,"However, it remains unknown how severe stress affects neural functioning in humans and what factors mediate individual differences in the neural sequelae of stress.",
21242990,"The amygdala is a key brain region involved in threat detection and fear regulation, and previous animal studies have suggested that stress sensitizes amygdala responsivity and reduces its regulation by the prefrontal cortex.",
21242990,"In this study, we used a prospective design to investigate the consequences of severe stress in soldiers before and after deployment to a combat zone.",
21242990,"We found that combat stress increased amygdala and insula reactivity to biologically salient stimuli across the group of combat-exposed individuals.",
21242990,"In contrast, its influence on amygdala coupling with the insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex was dependent on perceived threat, rather than actual exposure, suggesting that threat appraisal affects interoceptive awareness and amygdala regulation.",
21242990,"Our results demonstrate that combat stress has sustained consequences on neural responsivity, and suggest a key role for the appraisal of threat on an amygdala-centered neural network in the aftermath of severe stress.",
22250290,"Anxious emotion can manifest on brief (threat response) and/or persistent (chronic apprehension and arousal) timescales, and prior work has suggested that these signals are supported by separable neural circuitries.",
22250290,"This fMRI study utilized a mixed block-event-related emotional provocation paradigm in 55 healthy participants to simultaneously measure brief and persistent anxious emotional responses, testing the specificity of, and interactions between, these potentially distinct systems.",
22250290,"Results indicated that components of emotional processing networks were uniquely sensitive to transient and sustained anxious emotion.",
22250290,"Whereas the amygdala and midbrain showed only transient responses, the ventral basal forebrain and anterior insula showed sustained activity during extended emotional contexts that tracked positively with task-evoked anxiety.",
22250290,"States of lesser anxiety were associated with greater sustained activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.",
22250290,"Furthermore, ventromedial prefrontal recruitment was lower in individuals with higher scores on intolerance of uncertainty measures, and this hyporecruitment predicted greater transient amygdala responding to potential threat cues.",
22250290,"This work demonstrates how brain circuitries interact across temporal scales to support brief and persistent anxious emotion and suggests potentially divergent mechanisms of dysregulation in clinical syndromes marked by brief versus persistent symptoms of anxiety.",
28981839,"Sustained anticipatory anxiety is central to Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).",
28981839,"During anticipatory anxiety, phasic threat responding appears to be mediated by the amygdala, while sustained threat responding seems related to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST).",
28981839,"Although sustained anticipatory anxiety in GAD patients was proposed to be associated with BNST activity alterations, firm evidence is lacking.",
28981839,"We aimed to explore temporal characteristics of BNST and amygdala activity during threat anticipation in GAD patients.",
28981839,"Nineteen GAD patients and nineteen healthy controls (HC) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a temporally unpredictable threat anticipation paradigm.",
28981839,"We defined phasic and a systematic variation of sustained response models for blood oxygen level-dependent responses during threat anticipation, to disentangle temporally dissociable involvement of the BNST and the amygdala.",
28981839,"GAD patients relative to HC responded with increased phasic amygdala activity to onset of threat anticipation and with elevated sustained BNST activity that was delayed relative to the onset of threat anticipation.",
28981839,"Both the amygdala and the BNST displayed altered responses during threat anticipation in GAD patients, albeit with different time courses.",
28981839,"The results for the BNST activation hint towards its role in sustained threat responding, and contribute to a deeper understanding of pathological sustained anticipatory anxiety in GAD.",
28555565,"Anxiety disorders affect approximately 1 in 5 (18%) Americans within a given 1 year period, placing a substantial burden on the national health care system.",
28555565,"Therefore, there is a critical need to understand the neural mechanisms mediating anxiety symptoms.",
28555565,"We used unbiased, multimodal, data-driven, whole-brain measures of neural activity (magnetoencephalography) and connectivity (fMRI) to identify the regions of the brain that contribute most prominently to sustained anxiety.",
28555565,"We report that a single brain region, the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), shows both elevated neural activity and global brain connectivity during threat.",
28555565,"The IPS plays a key role in attention orienting and may contribute to the hypervigilance that is a common symptom of pathological anxiety.",
28555565,"Hyperactivation of this region during elevated state anxiety may account for the paradoxical facilitation of performance on tasks that require an external focus of attention, and impairment of performance on tasks that require an internal focus of attention.",
24886788,"BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging research has traditionally explored fear and anxiety in response to discrete threat cues (e.g., during fear conditioning).",
24886788,"However, anxiety is a sustained aversive state that can persist in the absence of discrete threats.",
24886788,"Little is known about mechanisms that maintain anxiety states over a prolonged period.",
24886788,"Here, we used a robust translational paradigm (threat of shock) to induce sustained anxiety.",
24886788,"Recent translational work has implicated an amygdala-prefrontal cortex (PFC) circuit in the maintenance of anxiety in rodents.",
24886788,"To explore the functional homologues of this circuitry in humans, we used a novel paradigm to examine the impact of sustained anticipatory anxiety on amygdala-PFC intrinsic connectivity.",
24886788,"METHODS: Task-independent fMRI data were collected in healthy participants during long-duration periods of shock anticipation and safety.",
24886788,"We examined intrinsic functional connectivity.",
24886788,"RESULTS: Our study involved 20 healthy participants.",
24886788,"During sustained anxiety, amygdala activity was positively coupled with dorsomedial PFC (DMPFC) activity.",
24886788,"High trait anxiety was associated with increased amygdala-DMPFC coupling.",
24886788,"In addition, induced anxiety was associated with positive coupling between regions involved in defensive responding, and decreased coupling between regions involved in emotional control and the default mode network.",
24886788,"LIMITATIONS: Inferences regarding anxious pathology should be made with caution because this study was conducted in healthy participants.",
24886788,"CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that anticipatory anxiety increases intrinsic amygdala-DMPFC coupling and that the DMPFC may serve as a functional homologue for the rodent prefrontal regions by sustaining anxiety.",
24886788,"Future research may use this defensive neural context to identify biomarkers of risk for anxious pathology and target these circuits for therapeutic intervention.",
21075229,"INTRODUCTION: Reducing fear when a threat has disappeared protects against a continuously elevated anxiety state.",
21075229,"In this study, we investigated the brain mechanism involved in this process.",
21075229,"METHODS: The threat paradigm consisted of discrete cues that signaled either threat of shock or safety.",
21075229,"Healthy participants were tested in two sessions in which eyeblink startle (n = 26) and blood oxygen level dependence (n = 23) were measured to index subjects' defensive state and brain responses respectively.",
21075229,"RESULTS: Startle results indicated that subjects could rapidly decrease their defensive state after the offset of shock threat.",
21075229,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging data indicated that the termination of threat was associated with the recruitment of lateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortices.",
21075229,"An exploratory connectivity analysis showed that activity in these prefrontal regions was linked and was also associated with activity in brain regions typically responding to threat, the right anterior insula and amygdala.",
21075229,"CONCLUSIONS: These results provide first evidence for a prefrontal mechanism that functions to control anxiety after threat offset, which may be dysfunctional in patients who suffer from excessive sustained anxiety.",
21075229,"Moreover, the results support a model in which the lateral prefrontal cortex controls anxiety related limbic activity through connections with ventromedial prefrontal cortex.",
22390706,"An extensive body of research has demonstrated that anxious individuals abnormally process threat-related content.",
22390706,"Yet, the manner in which clinical anxiety affects the selection of threatening signals and their maintenance within consciousness is yet to be explored.",
22390706,"The present study used an emotional binocular rivalry (e-BR) procedure, in which pictures of faces depicting either fearful or neutral expressions competed with pictures of a house for conscious perception.",
22390706,"We assumed that first- or cumulative-preferred perception of faces with fearful over neutral expression (i.e., initial or sustained threat bias, respectively) stand for preferential selection or maintenance of fear content in awareness, correspondingly.",
22390706,"Unmedicated patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) and panic disorder (PAD) were compared to healthy controls for threat-related perceptual biases in the e-BR.",
22390706,"At first perception of face, both SAD and PAD patients showed a greater initial threat bias than healthy controls.",
22390706,"In contrast, at cumulative dwell-time of face, patient groups demonstrated a diminished sustained threat bias relative to healthy controls, yet in a different manner.",
22390706,"SAD patients showed a sustained threat bias, though it was smaller than in healthy controls.",
22390706,"Furthermore, increased levels of reported anxiety among SAD patients were associated with enhanced sustained perception of neutral faces.",
22390706,"PAD patients, on the other hand, showed no sustained threat bias and a diminished cumulative perception of fearful faces with increased levels of anxiety traits.",
22390706,"These findings indicate that anxiety disorders commonly involve an initially enhanced selection of threat signals into awareness, followed by disorder-specific manifestation of diminished preferred maintenance of threat in awareness.",
15837118,"The extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway has a key role in cell survival and brain plasticity, processes that are impaired following exposure to stressful situations.",
15837118,"We have recently validated two repeated intermittent stress procedures in male NMRI mice, social threat and repeated exposure to a novel cage, which result in clear behavioral effects following 4 weeks of application.",
15837118,"The present results demonstrate that both repeated intermittent stress procedures alter the activity of the ERK1/2 pathway in the brain, as shown by changes in phosphorylated ERK1/2 (phospho-ERK1/2) protein expression and in the expression of downstream proteins: phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), in the hippocampus, the frontal cortex and the hypothalamus.",
15837118,"The hippocampus showed greater responsiveness to stress as the two stressors increased phospho-ERK1/2 and BDNF expression under acute condition.",
15837118,"Following repeated stress, hyperphosphorylation of ERK1/2 was associated with up-regulation of hippocampal BDNF expression in the social threat group but not in mice exposed to novel cage.",
15837118,"This lack of a pro-survival effect of ERK1/2 with repeated novel cage exposure may constitute an early event in stress-mediated brain pathology.",
15837118,"The sustained BDNF up-regulation in the hippocampi of mice subjected to repeated social threat could be related to rewarding aspects of aggressive interactions, suggested by our previous studies.",
30878610,"Anticipation of potentially threatening social situations is a key process in social anxiety disorder (SAD).",
30878610,"In other anxiety disorders, recent research of neural correlates of anticipation of temporally unpredictable threat suggests a temporally dissociable involvement of amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) with phasic amygdala responses and sustained BNST activation.",
30878610,"However, the temporal profile of amygdala and BNST responses during temporal unpredictability of threat has not been investigated in patients suffering from SAD.",
30878610,"We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural activation in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and the BNST during anticipation of temporally unpredictable aversive (video camera observation) relative to neutral (no camera observation) events in SAD patients compared to healthy controls (HC).",
30878610,"For the analysis of fMRI data, we applied two regressors (phasic/sustained) within the same model to detect temporally dissociable brain responses.",
30878610,"The aversive condition induced increased anxiety in patients compared to HC.",
30878610,"SAD patients compared to HC showed increased phasic activation in the CeA and the BNST for anticipation of aversive relative to neutral events.",
30878610,"SAD patients as well as HC showed sustained activity alterations in the BNST for aversive relative to neutral anticipation.",
30878610,"No differential activity during sustained threat anticipation in SAD patients compared to HC was found.",
30878610,"Taken together, our study reveals both CeA and BNST involvement during threat anticipation in SAD patients.",
30878610,"The present results point towards potentially SAD-specific threat processing marked by elevated phasic but not sustained CeA and BNST responses when compared to HC.",
25761115,"Fear-potentiated acoustic startle paradigms have been used to investigate phasic and sustained components of conditioned fear in rats and humans.",
25761115,"This study describes a novel training protocol to assess phasic and sustained fear in freely behaving C57BL/6J mice, using freezing and/or fear-potentiated startle as measures of fear, thereby, if needed, allowing in vivo application of various techniques, such as optogenetics, electrophysiology and pharmacological intervention, in freely behaving animals.",
25761115,"An auditory Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm, with pseudo-randomized conditioned-unconditioned stimulus presentations at various durations, is combined with repetitive brief auditory white noise burst presentations during fear memory retrieval 24 h after fear conditioning.",
25761115,"Major findings are that (1) a motion sensitive platform built on mechano-electrical transducers enables measurement of startle responses in freely behaving mice, (2) absence or presence of startle stimuli during retrieval as well as unpredictability of a given threat determine phasic and sustained fear response profiles and (3) both freezing and startle responses indicate phasic and sustained components of behavioral fear, with sustained freezing reflecting unpredictability of conditioned stimulus (CS)/unconditioned stimulus (US) pairings.",
25761115,"This paradigm and available genetically modified mouse lines will pave the way for investigation of the molecular and neural mechanisms relating to the transition from phasic to sustained fear.",
27698427,"The brain circuits underlying behavioral fear have been extensively studied over the last decades.",
27698427,"Although the vast majority of experimental studies assess fear as a transient state of apprehension in response to a discrete threat, such phasic states of fear can shift to a sustained anxious apprehension, particularly in face of diffuse cues with unpredictable environmental contingencies.",
27698427,"Unpredictability, in turn, is considered an important variable contributing to anxiety disorders.",
27698427,"The networks of the extended amygdala have been suggested keys to the control of phasic and sustained states of fear, although the underlying synaptic pathways and mechanisms remain poorly understood.",
27698427,"Here, we show that the endocannabinoid system acting in synaptic circuits of the extended amygdala can explain the fear response profile during exposure to unpredictable threat.",
27698427,"Using fear training with predictable or unpredictable cues in mice, combined with local and cell-type-specific deficiency and rescue of cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors, we found that presynaptic CB1 receptors on distinct amygdala projections to bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) are both necessary and sufficient for the shift from phasic to sustained fear in response to an unpredictable threat.",
27698427,"These results thereby identify the causal role of a defined protein in a distinct brain pathway for the temporal development of a sustained state of anxious apprehension during unpredictability of environmental influences, reminiscent of anxiety symptoms in humans.",
30463809,"Downregulation of emotional responses to threat is strongly associated with frontal cortex functions.",
30463809,"Additionally pathological anxiety has been proposed to be associated with the altered frontal control.",
30463809,"Understanding the frontal regulation of both initial and sustained fear responses seems to be crucial for further research on the treatment of anxiety disorders.",
30463809,"Therefore, this study aims to examine the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) on the subjects' psychophysiological responses as measured by skin conductance reaction (SCR) during a sustained threat paradigm.",
30463809,"80 participants were randomly assigned to an anodal and sham stimulation group in a double-blinded manner.",
30463809,"Indicated by visual cues, participants anticipated the temporally unpredictable occurrence of aversive or neutral auditory stimuli.",
30463809,"We found a significant interaction effect of condition x tDCS for SCR during the sustained threat.",
30463809,"Post-hoc tests revealed a significant reduction in SCR during sustained fear in verum stimulated group.",
30463809,"The results confirm that tDCS of the rIFC attenuates sustained fear.",
30463809,"This supports the suggested role of the rIFC in psychophysiological emotional regulation and the potential use of tDCS to enhance these effects.",
20727909,"In contrast to a perceptible threat that releases freezing, fleeing and fighting, abstract potential threat elicits anxiety and vigilance.",
20727909,"The prevalent view is that the larger the animal groups the lower the individual vigilance.",
20727909,"Vigilance is a reflection of anxiety, and here we show that anxiety is contagious in grouped social animals.",
20727909,"In humans, anxiety frequently results in rituals that confer a sense of controllability and thereby a means to cope with anxiety.",
20727909,"Accordingly, in mental disorders with sustained anxiety, rituals predominate the behavior and consequently reduce functionality.",
20727909,"Finally, the adaptive value of precautionary behavior, including rituals, lies in providing individuals with the opportunity to practice defensive means safely, and thus to prepare for the eventuality of real danger.",
20727909,"Accordingly, the prevalence of anxiety in human and animal behavior accords with the better safe than sorry principle.",
17582673,"Processing task-irrelevant emotional information may compromise attention performance, particularly among those showing elevated threat sensitivity.",
17582673,"If threat-sensitive individuals are able to recruit attentional control to inhibit emotional processing, however, they may show few decrements in attention performance.",
17582673,"To examine this hypothesis, attention performance was measured in three domains--alerting, orienting, and executive attention.",
17582673,"Task-irrelevant fearful, sad, and happy faces were presented for 50 ms before each trial of the attention task to create a mildly competitive emotional context.",
17582673,"Electroencephalographic recordings were made from 64 scalp electrodes to generate event-related potentials (ERPs) to the faces.",
17582673,"Participants reporting high threat sensitivity showed enhanced ERPs thought to reflect emotional processing (P200) and attentional control (P100 and N200).",
17582673,"Enhanced N200 following fearful faces was linked to sustained and even slightly improved executive attention performance (reduced conflict interference) among high threat-sensitive individuals, but with decrements in executive attention among low threat-sensitive individuals.",
17582673,"Results are discussed in terms of cognitive processing efficiency and the balance between threat sensitivity and attentional control in relation to executive attention performance.",
17582673,"Results may have implications for understanding automatic and voluntary attentional biases related to anxiety.",
17683209,"Previous work has indicated that simple geometric shapes underlying facial expressions are capable of conveying emotional meaning.",
17683209,"Specifically, a series of studies found that a simple shape, a downward-pointing V, which is similar to the geometric configuration of the face in angry expressions, is perceived as threatening.",
17683209,"A parallel line of research has determined that threatening stimuli more readily capture attention.",
17683209,"In five experiments, the authors sought to determine whether this preferential processing was also present for the simple geometric form of a downward-pointing V. Using a visual search paradigm, across these experiments the authors found that, when embedded in a field of other shapes, downward-pointing V's were detected faster and, in some cases, more accurately than identical shapes pointing upward.",
17683209,"These findings indicate that the meaning of threat can be conveyed rapidly with minimal stimulus detail.",
17683209,"In addition, in some cases, during trials of homogeneous fields of stimuli, fields of downward-pointing V's led to slower response times, suggesting that this shape's ability to capture attention may also extend to difficulty in disengaging attention as well.",
17554005,"The goal of this study was to compare cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes associated with phasic cued fear versus those associated with sustained contextual anxiety.",
17554005,"Positron emission tomography images of CBF were acquired using [O-15]H2O in 17 healthy human subjects as they anticipated unpleasant electric shocks that were administered predictably (signaled by a visual cue) or unpredictably (threatened by the context).",
17554005,"Presentation of the cue in either threat condition was associated with increased CBF in the left amygdala.",
17554005,"A cue that specifically predicted the shock was associated with CBF increases in the ventral prefrontal cortex (PFC), hypothalamus, anterior cingulate cortex, left insula, and bilateral putamen.",
17554005,"The sustained threat context increased CBF in the right hippocampus, mid-cingulate gyrus, subgenual PFC, midbrain periaqueductal gray, thalamus, bilateral ventral striatum, and parieto-occipital cortex.",
17554005,"This study showed distinct neuronal networks involved in cued fear and contextual anxiety underlying the importance of this distinction for studies on the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders.",
24095880,"Many forms of human psychopathology are characterized by sustained negative emotional responses to threat and chronic behavioral avoidance, implicating avoidance as a potential transdiagnostic factor.",
24095880,"Evidence from both nonhuman neurophysiological and human neuroimaging studies suggests a distributed frontal-limbic-striatal brain network supports avoidance.",
24095880,"However, our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the network to sustained threat that prompts sustained avoidance is limited.",
24095880,"To address this issue, 17 adults were given extensive training on a modified free-operant avoidance task in which button pressing avoided money loss during a sustained threat period.",
24095880,"Subsequently, subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while completing the avoidance task.",
24095880,"In our regions of interest, we observed phasic, rather than sustained, activation during sustained threat in dorsolateral and inferior frontal regions, anterior and dorsal cingulate, ventral striatum and regions associated with emotion, including the amygdala, insula, substantia nigra and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis complex.",
24095880,"Moreover, trait levels of experiential avoidance were negatively correlated with insula, hippocampal and amygdala activation.",
24095880,"These findings suggest knowledge that one can consistently avoid aversive outcomes is not associated with decreased threat-related responses and that individuals with greater experiential avoidance exhibit reduced reactivity to initial threat.",
24095880,"Implications for understanding brain mechanisms supporting human avoidance and psychological theories of avoidance are discussed.",
19693004,"Data will be reviewed using the acoustic startle reflex in rats and humans based on our attempts to operationally define fear vs anxiety.",
19693004,"Although the symptoms of fear and anxiety are very similar, they also differ.",
19693004,"Fear is a generally adaptive state of apprehension that begins rapidly and dissipates quickly once the threat is removed (phasic fear).",
19693004,"Anxiety is elicited by less specific and less predictable threats, or by those that are physically or psychologically more distant.",
19693004,"Thus, anxiety is a more long-lasting state of apprehension (sustained fear).",
19693004,"Rodent studies suggest that phasic fear is mediated by the amygdala, which sends outputs to the hypothalamus and brainstem to produce symptoms of fear.",
19693004,"Sustained fear is also mediated by the amygdala, which releases corticotropin-releasing factor, a stress hormone that acts on receptors in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a part of the so-called 'extended amygdala.'",
19693004,"The amygdala and BNST send outputs to the same hypothalamic and brainstem targets to produce phasic and sustained fear, respectively.",
19693004,"In rats, sustained fear is more sensitive to anxiolytic drugs.",
19693004,"In humans, symptoms of clinical anxiety are better detected in sustained rather than phasic fear paradigms.",
27369069,"Anxiety can have both detrimental and facilitatory cognitive effects.",
27369069,"This study investigates the neural substrates of a replicated facilitatory effect of anxiety on sustained attention and response inhibition.",
27369069,"This effect consisted of improved performance on the Sustained Attention to Response Task (a Go-NoGo task consisting of 91% Go and 9% NoGo trials) in threat (unpredictable electrical shock) vs safe (no shock) conditions.",
27369069,"This study uses the same experimental design with fMRI and relies on an event-related analysis of BOLD signal changes.",
27369069,"Findings reveal that threat-related cognitive facilitation (improved NoGo accuracy) is associated with greater activation of a right-lateralized frontoparietal group of regions previously implicated in sustained attention and response inhibition.",
27369069,"Moreover, these same regions show decreased activation in the Go trials preceding NoGo errors.",
27369069,"During NoGo trials, striatal activity is also greater in the threat vs safe condition, consistent with the notion of enhanced inhibitory processing under threat.",
27369069,"These findings identify potential mechanisms by which threat of unpredictable shock can facilitate distinct cognitive functions.",
27369069,"A greater understanding of the complex interaction of the anxious state and cognitive processes may have critical clinical implications.",
26810702,"Uncertainty about future threat has been found to be associated with an overestimation of threat probability and is hypothesized to elicit additional allocation of attention.",
26810702,"We used event-related potentials to examine uncertainty-related dynamics in attentional allocation, exploiting brain potentials' high temporal resolution and sensitivity to attention.",
26810702,"Thirty participants performed a picture-viewing task in which cues indicated the subsequent picture valence.",
26810702,"A certain-neutral and a certain-aversive cue accurately predicted subsequent picture valence, whereas an uncertain cue did not.",
26810702,"Participants overestimated the effective frequency of aversive pictures following the uncertain cue, both during and after the task, signifying expectancy and covariation biases, and they tended to express lower subjective valences for aversive pictures presented after the uncertain cue.",
26810702,"Pictures elicited increased P2 and LPP amplitudes when their valence could not be predicted from the cue.",
26810702,"For the LPP, this effect was more pronounced in response to neutral pictures.",
26810702,"Uncertainty appears to enhance the engagement of early phasic and sustained attention for uncertainly cued targets.",
26810702,"Thus, defensive motivation related to uncertainty about future threat elicits specific attentional dynamics implicating prioritization at various processing stages, especially for nonthreatening stimuli that tend to violate expectations.",
18472088,"Anxious individuals show an attention bias towards threatening information.",
18472088,"However, under conditions of sustained environmental threat this otherwise-present attention bias disappears.",
18472088,"It remains unclear whether this suppression of attention bias can be caused by a transient activation of the fear system.",
18472088,"In the present experiment, high socially anxious and low socially anxious individuals (HSA group, n=12; LSA group, n=12) performed a modified dot-probe task in which they were shown either a neutral or socially threatening prime word prior to each trial.",
18472088,"EEG was collected and ERP components to the prime and faces displays were computed.",
18472088,"HSA individuals showed an attention bias to threat after a neutral prime, but no attention bias after a threatening prime, demonstrating that suppression of attention bias can occur after a transient activation of the fear system.",
18472088,"LSA individuals showed an opposite pattern: no evidence of a bias to threat with neutral primes but induction of an attention bias to threat following threatening primes.",
18472088,"ERP results suggested differential processing of the prime and faces displays by HSA and LSA individuals.",
18472088,"However, no group by prime interaction was found for any of ERP components.",
25062842,"Threatening stimuli have been shown to preferentially capture attention using a range of tasks and measures.",
25062842,"However, attentional bias to threat has not typically been found in unselected individuals using behavioral measures in the dot-probe task, one of the most common ways of examining attention to threat.",
25062842,"The present study leveraged event-related potentials (ERPs) in conjunction with behavioral measures in the dot-probe task to examine whether more direct measures of attention might reveal an attentional bias to threat in unselected individuals.",
25062842,"As in previous dot-probe studies, we found no evidence of an attentional bias to threat using reaction time; additionally, this measure exhibited poor internal reliability.",
25062842,"In contrast, ERPs revealed an initial shift of attention to threat-related stimuli, reflected by the N2pc, which showed moderate internal reliability.",
25062842,"However, there was no evidence of sustained engagement with the threat-related stimuli, as measured by the late positive potential (LPP).",
25062842,"Together, these results demonstrate that unselected individuals do initially allocate attention to threat in the dot-probe task, and further, that this bias is better characterized by neural measures of attention than traditional behavioral measures.",
25062842,"These results have implications for the study of attention to threat in both unselected and anxious populations.",
22913418,"Threat cues elicit defensive reactions mediated by limbic brain circuitry that is also implicated in risk-sensitive decision making.",
22913418,"Building upon research looking at stress effects on decision making, a gambling task was administered to 65 healthy adults, comparing decision making on trials on which a red screen background signalled threat of shocks against trials when shocks could not occur.",
22913418,"The threat cues elicited increased electrodermal activity and a sustained decrease in heart rate, consistent with defensive vigilance.",
22913418,"The threat condition was associated with risk-avoidant choices, on trials where the risky option involved moderate losses and when choosing between options involving only losses.",

29980493,"RESULTS: The placebo group showed similarly high left amygdala activation early on during presentation of fearful and happy faces, which decreased over time.",
29980493,"In contrast, losartan reduced amygdala response to happy faces early on.",
29980493,"In response to fearful faces, the drug prevented habituation, caused sustained amygdala activation, and led to increased activation in other brain areas associated with threat processing, such as the insula and putamen.",
29980493,"CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest two distinct effects of losartan on emotional processing, including an improvement of early discrimination of stimuli as threatening versus safe, and facilitation of threat processing.",
29980493,"Both processes are known to be relevant for successful exposure, highlighting two potential pathways by which losartan might exert facilitative effects on psychological treatment.",
30144498,"Pervasive avoidance behaviour is a core feature of anxiety disorders.",
30144498,"However, little is known about how the availability of avoidance modulates learned threat responding.",
30144498,"To assess this question, we recorded avoidance behaviour, electrodermal activity and expectancy ratings in 53 healthy participants during an associative learning paradigm with embedded unavoidable and avoidable trials.",
30144498,"When avoidance was available, we observed greater avoidance behaviour for threat versus safety cues, as well as reduced differential skin conductance responses for unavoidable threat versus safety cues.",
30144498,"When avoidance was unavailable, as during the extinction phase, we observed sustained differential skin conductance responses for threat versus safety cues.",
30144498,"For all phases, we found greater expectancy ratings for threat versus safe cues.",
30144498,"Furthermore, greater avoidance behaviour predicted larger differential skin conductance responses to threat versus safety cues during extinction.",
30144498,"Overall, the results show that the conditioned response is attenuated during situations where avoidance is available, but it recovers when avoidance is unavailable, subsequently prolonging threat extinction.",
28013055,"Cognitive theories of anxiety psychopathology cite biased attention towards threat as a central vulnerability and maintaining factor.",
28013055,"However, many studies have found threat bias indices to have poor reliability and have failed to observe the theorized relationship between threat bias and anxiety symptoms; this may be due to the non-unitary nature of threat bias and the influence of state-level variables on its expression.",
28013055,"Accumulating data suggests that state anxious mood is important for the robust expression of threat bias and for relations to emerge between threat bias and symptoms, though this possibility has not been experimentally tested.",
28013055,"Eye-tracking was used to assess multiple forms of threat bias (i.e., early vigilance, sustained attention, facilitated engagement, delayed disengagement) thought to be related to anxiety.",
28013055,"A non-clinical sample (N = 165) was recruited to test the hypothesis that biased attention towards threat, but not dysphoric or positive emotional stimuli, during an anxious mood induction, but not at a pre-stress baseline, would prospectively predict greater worry symptoms on days in which more naturalistic stressors occurred.",
28013055,"Results revealed the hypothesized moderation effect for sustained attention towards threat after the mood induction but not at baseline, though sustained attention towards dysphoric stimuli also moderated the effect of stressors on worry.",
28013055,"Worry-relevant sustained attention towards negative emotional stimuli may be a partially mood-context dependent phenomenon.",
25143607,"Entering a state of anxious anticipation triggers widespread changes across large-scale networks in the brain.",
25143607,"The temporal aspects of this transition into an anxious state are poorly understood.",
25143607,"To address this question, an instructed threat of shock paradigm was used while recording functional MRI in humans to measure how activation and functional connectivity change over time across the salience, executive, and task-negative networks and how they interact with key regions implicated in emotional processing; the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST).",
25143607,"Transitions into threat blocks were associated with transient responses in regions of the salience network and sustained responses in a putative BNST site, among others.",
25143607,"Multivariate network measures of communication were computed, revealing changes to network organization during transient and sustained periods of threat, too.",
25143607,"For example, the salience network exhibited a transient increase in network efficiency followed by a period of sustained decreased efficiency.",
25143607,"The amygdala became more central to network function (as assessed via betweenness centrality) during threat across all participants, and the extent to which the BNST became more central during threat depended on self-reported anxiety.",
25143607,"Together, our study unraveled a progression of responses and network-level changes due to sustained threat.",
25143607,"In particular, our results reveal how network organization unfolds with time during periods of anxious anticipation.",
15294391,"This study investigated whether attentional processes contribute to fear-potentiated startle.",
15294391,"Ten subjects participated in a threat of shock experiment and an attentional control condition.",
15294391,"In the threat of shock experiment, visual cues indicated whether or not an aversive shock might occur.",
15294391,"In the attentional control, the shocks were replaced by faint vibrotactile stimuli that had to be counted.",
15294391,"The P300 amplitudes of the ERP evoked by the visual cues did not differ under threat and counting, which suggested that both conditions engaged attention to the same extent.",
15294391,"In contrast, startle potentiation in the threat condition was an order of magnitude larger than the marginally significant attentional startle facilitation in the counting condition.",
15294391,"These results indicate that an attentional contribution to fear-potentiated startle under the present experimental conditions is small.",
15294391,"In addition, contextual effects of threat of shock became manifest as baseline startle was facilitated relative to the attention condition.",
15294391,"This may reflect a more sustained state of anxiety on which cue-specific fear responses are superimposed.",
21440905,"Research has highlighted the need for new methods to assess emotions in children on multiple levels to gain better insight into the complex processes of emotional development.",
21440905,"The startle reflex is a unique translational tool that has been used to study physiological processes during fear and anxiety in rodents and in human participants.",
21440905,"However, it has been challenging to implement developmentally appropriate startle experiments in children.",
21440905,"This article describes a procedure that uses predictable and unpredictable aversive events to distinguish between phasic fear and sustained anxiety in children and adolescents.",
21440905,"We investigated anxious responses, as measured with the startle reflex, in youths (N=36, mean age=12.63 years, range=7-17) across three conditions: no aversive events (N), predictable aversive events (P), and unpredictable aversive events (U).",
21440905,"Short-duration cues were presented several times in each condition.",
21440905,"Aversive events were signaled by the cues in the P condition but were presented randomly in the U condition.",
21440905,"Participants showed fear-potentiated startle to the threat cue in the P condition.",
21440905,"Startle responses were also elevated between cues in the U condition compared with the N condition, suggesting that unpredictable aversive events can evoke a sustained state of anxiety in youths.",
21440905,"This latter effect was influenced by sex, being greater in girls than in boys.",
21440905,"These findings indicate the feasibility of this experimental induction of the startle reflex in response to predictable and unpredictable events in children and adolescents, enabling future research on interindividual differences in fear and anxiety and their development in youths.",
20883506,"Threat stimuli are considered to be processed with higher priority due to an automatic threat detection system that enables rapid shifts of attention.",
20883506,"However, direct evidence is still missing.",

20883506,"The threat detection advantage was replicated in the behavioral results.",
20883506,"An N2pc was observed that was more pronounced and earlier for angry compared to happy faces, suggesting differential attention allocation underlying the threat detection advantage.",
20883506,"A larger sustained posterior contralateral negativity indicated that angry faces also gained more enhanced subsequent processing.",
20883506,"An early posterior negativity observed 160 ms after stimulus onset revealed early emotion-specific processing that may have caused differences in attention allocation toward threatening stimuli.",
21111828,"Aversive events are typically more debilitating when they occur unpredictably than predictably.",
21111828,"Studies in humans and animals indicate that predictable and unpredictable aversive events can induce phasic and sustained fear, respectively.",
21111828,"Research in rodents suggests that anatomically related but distinct neural circuits may mediate phasic and sustained fear.",
21111828,"We explored this issue in humans by examining threat predictability in three virtual reality contexts, one in which electric shocks were predictably signaled by a cue, a second in which shocks occurred unpredictably but never paired with a cue, and a third in which no shocks were delivered.",
21111828,"Evidence of threat-induced phasic and sustained fear was presented using fear ratings and skin conductance.",
21111828,"Utilizing recent advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we were able to conduct whole-brain fMRI at relatively high spatial resolution and still have enough sensitivity to detect transient and sustained signal changes in the basal forebrain.",
21111828,"We found that both predictable and unpredictable threat evoked transient activity in the dorsal amygdala, but that only unpredictable threat produced sustained activity in a forebrain region corresponding to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis complex.",
21111828,"Consistent with animal models hypothesizing a role for the cortex in generating sustained fear, sustained signal increases to unpredictable threat were also found in anterior insula and a frontoparietal cortical network associated with hypervigilance.",
21111828,"In addition, unpredictable threat led to transient activity in the ventral amygdala-hippocampal area and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, as well as transient activation and subsequent deactivation of subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, limbic structures that have been implicated in the regulation of emotional behavior and stress responses.",
21111828,"In line with basic findings in rodents, these results provide evidence that phasic and sustained fear in humans may manifest similar signs of distress, but appear to be associated with different patterns of neural activity in the human basal forebrain.",

28485259,"RESULTS: PD patients compared with HC showed phasic amygdala and sustained BNST responses during anticipation of aversive v. neutral stimuli.",
28485259,"Furthermore, increased phasic activation was observed in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula and prefrontal cortex (PFC).",
28485259,"Insula and PFC also showed sustained activation.",

28485259,"In line with a hypersensitivity to uncertainty in PD, our results suggest time-dependent involvement of brain regions related to fear and anxiety.",
21666261,"We examined whether amygdala responses to rapidly presented fear expressions are preferentially tuned to averted vs direct gaze fear and conversely whether responses to more sustained presentations are preferentially tuned to direct vs averted gaze fear.",
21666261,"We conducted three functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies to test these predictions including: Study 1: a block design employing sustained presentations (1 s) of averted vs direct gaze fear expressions taken from the Pictures of Facial Affect; Study 2: a block design employing rapid presentations (300 ms) of these same stimuli and Study 3: a direct replication of these studies in the context of a single experiment using stimuli selected from the NimStim Emotional Face Stimuli.",
21666261,"Together, these studies provide evidence consistent with an early, reflexive amygdala response tuned to clear threat and a later reflective response tuned to ambiguous threat.",
