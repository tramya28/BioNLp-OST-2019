29922871,"The moderating roles of birth order, sibling gender, and sibling dyad gender constellation also were tested.",
29922871,"Participants were 196 European American adolescent (firstborn-secondborn) sibling pairs who were 16.47 years (SD = 0.80) and 13.88 years (SD = 1.15) of age, respectively, at the onset of this study.",
29922871,"Data were collected separately from each sibling during home interviews.",
29922871,"Multilevel models revealed that being the target of sibling relational aggression was associated with all four adjustment outcomes at the between-person level, and with risky behavior and romantic competence at the within-person level.",
29922871,"However, some of these effects were moderated by sibling dyad characteristics.",

25363638,"Nested regression models with robust cluster standard errors demonstrated that the association between children's number of relationships and their levels of relational aggression was moderated by the number of relationships that their affiliates had.",
25363638,"Children with more peer relationships (i.e., higher network centrality) exhibited higher levels of relational aggression, but only when these relationships were with peers who had fewer connections themselves (i.e., poorly connected peers).",
25363638,"This finding remained significant even when controlling for common predictors of relational aggression including gender, overt aggression, prosocial behavior, victimization, social preference, and perceived popularity.",

26146468,"Observations and teacher reports of aggression were collected in preschool, and kindergarten teachers reported on student-teacher relationship quality, child internalizing problems, and peer acceptance in kindergarten.",
26146468,"Results suggested that preschool physical aggression predicted reduced peer acceptance and increased conflict with the kindergarten teacher.",
26146468,"High levels of relational aggression, when not combined with physical aggression, were related to more positive transitions to kindergarten in the domains assessed.",
26146468,"PRACTICE OR POLICY: These data lend support to the need for interventions among physically aggressive preschoolers to target not only concurrent behavior but also future aggression and adjustment in kindergarten.",
26146468,"Thus, educators should work to encourage social influence in more prosocial ways amongst aggressive preschoolers.",

21833240,"We determine that there is a great deal of similarity between these two sources in how relational aggression is understood and how it may be treated.",
21833240,"The concurrence across both dissemination formats reflects terminology and definitions, the harmful effects of relational aggression, the gender-specific nature of the condition to women and girls, its age of occurrence, the impact of parenting styles, its relationship to girls' social competence, and nature of its expression through non-physical means.",

25375971,"CONCLUSIONS: Significant associations between physical aggression and poor language ability are minimal and limited to the period when physical aggression and language performance are both substantially increasing.",
25375971,"During that period parenting behaviours may play an important role in supporting language ability while reducing the frequency of physical aggression.",
25375971,"Further studies are needed that utilize multiple assessments of physical aggression, assess multiple domains of language abilities, and that examine the potential mediating role of parenting behaviours between 12 and 48 months.",
28070756,"Previous research has focused primarily on corporal punishment as a cause and adolescents' physical aggression as an outcome.",
28070756,"However, there is a large gap in knowledge of the potentially bidirectional association and explanatory mechanism underlying the association between corporal punishment and physical aggression.",
28070756,"The current study, using a longitudinal design across three time points (the fall semester of 7th grade, the fall of 8th grade, and the fall of 9th grade), aimed to a) examine the reciprocal processes between corporal punishment and physical aggression, and b) explore whether deviant peer affiliation may explain such reciprocal connections.",
28070756,"Only adolescents participating in all the three time points were included in this study, resulting in a final sample of 342 adolescents (175 boys, 167 girls) who completed questionnaires regarding corporal punishment, deviant peer affiliation, and aggression.",
28070756,"Gender, age and socioeconomic status were controlled for in the analyses.",

28070756,"A direct longitudinal link from corporal punishment to physical aggression was found, however, the inverse association was not significant.",
28070756,"Moreover, regarding the longitudinal underlying process, in one direction, corporal punishment at 7th grade predicted higher levels of deviant peer affiliation at 8th grade.",
28070756,"In turn, higher deviant peer affiliation at 8th grade predicted increased physical aggression at 9th grade.",
28070756,"At the same time, in the other direction, adolescent physical aggression at 7th grade significantly predicted deviant peer affiliation at 8th grade.",
28070756,"In turn, higher deviant peer affiliation at 8th grade predicted decreased corporal punishment at 9th grade.",

25134025,"Results indicated greater frequency of perpetrating relational aggression, higher levels of positive urgency, or higher levels of negative urgency was associated with more negative consequences.",
25134025,"Further, negative urgency moderated the relationship between frequency of perpetrating aggression and consequences such that aggression was more strongly associated with consequences for those high in urgency.",
25134025,"Counter to the adolescent literature, the frequency of being the target of aggression was not associated with more alcohol use.",
25134025,"These findings suggest that perpetrators of relational aggression may be at particular risk for negative alcohol-related consequences when they act impulsively in response to negative, but not positive, emotions.",

23831139,"Results revealed that exposure to relationally aggressive portrayals resulted in a hostile attributional bias in response to relational scenarios, whereas exposure to portrayals of physical aggression was associated with a hostile attributional bias in response to instrumental scenarios.",
23831139,"Moreover, these biases were shown to be specific to the exposure condition (physical or relational) and not simply associated with exposure to aggression in general.",
23831139,"The findings are discussed in terms of the general aggression model and children's social information processing.",
19822329,"The psychometric properties of a recently introduced adult self-report of relational aggression are presented.",
19822329,"Specifically, the predictive utility of proactive and reactive peer-directed relational aggression, as well as romantic relational aggression, are explored in a large (N=1387) study of adults.",
19822329,"The measure had adequate reliability and validity and the subscales demonstrated unique predictive abilities for a number of dependent variables.",
19822329,"In particular, reactive but not proactive relational aggression was uniquely associated with history of abuse, hostile attribution biases, and feelings of distress regarding relational provocation situations.",
19822329,"Reactive relational aggression was also more strongly related to anger and hostility than proactive aggression.",
19822329,"In addition, relational aggression in the context of romantic relationships was uniquely related to anger, hostility, impulsivity, history of abuse, hostile attribution biases, and emotional sensitivity to relational provocations, even when controlling for peer-directed relational aggression.",
19822329,"Gender differences in overall levels of relational aggression were not observed; however, males were most likely to engage in peer-directed proactive and reactive relational aggression whereas females were most likely to engage in romantic relational aggression.",
19822329,"In a second study (N=150), relational aggression was higher in a sample of adults with Intermittent Explosive Disorder than in a sample of healthy controls or psychiatric controls.",

24893884,"The link between attachment and intimate partner violence has been examined in the literature, but an area of aggression that often goes unexamined is relational aggression, or using third parties as a means of being aggressive toward a partner.",
24893884,"We asked how participants' attachment behaviors were related to their own and partners' relational and physical aggression.",
24893884,"We used structural equation modeling to estimate actor-partner interdependence among these relationships in 644 heterosexual couples.",
24893884,"Results indicated significant partner paths from attachment to relational aggression, as well as significant actor paths between relational aggression and physical aggression.",

25047295,"The results showed that rumination partially mediated the association between relational victimization and depressive symptoms.",
25047295,"No moderation effect was found.",
25047295,"In contrast, rumination moderated the association between relational aggression and depressive symptoms.",
25047295,"Specifically, relational aggression was associated with depressive symptoms for those adolescents who were also ruminators.",
25047295,"Thus, ruminating about victimization experiences appears to be an important mechanism that functions differently for relational aggression and relational victimization in conferring risk for depressive symptoms.",
25047295,"The findings offer important practical implications for those working with adolescents and also lay the groundwork for future research.",

26883026,"We extend past research on gender differences in the use of aggression by expanding the gender dichotomy and allowing for more variations in an individual's gender identity.",
26883026,"Students (N = 414, 47 % female, 6th grade) reported how similar they felt to both their own- and other-gender peers, from which cluster analyses derived four typologies of perceived gender similarity (those who feel similar to their own-gender group; those who feel similar to the other-gender group; those who feel similar to both gender groups; those who feel similar to neither gender group).",

26883026,"Findings were discussed in terms of their importance both for examining a broad spectrum of gender similarity and for understanding the use of aggressive behavior among children.",
25047290,"Founded in the social process model, the aim of this study was to identify whether the associations of relational aggression with concurrent and subsequent relational victimization differed depending on early adolescents' personal vulnerabilities and gender.",
25047290,"The vulnerabilities of interest were social-information processing variables that convey greater emotional sensitivity, including rejection sensitivity, fear of negative evaluation, and avoidance of intimacy.",
25047290,"Participants were 358 early adolescents (176 boys, 178 girls) aged 9 to 13 years.",
25047290,"Relational aggression and victimization were assessed via peer nominations, whereas the three indicators of emotional sensitivity were assessed via self-report.",
25047290,"Overall, results revealed greater relational aggression at Time 1 to be associated with greater relational victimization at both Time 1 and Time 2.",
25047290,"However, this finding was qualified by both emotional sensitivity and gender.",
25047290,"When considered separately, girls who were relationally aggressive and emotionally sensitive were at increased risk of victimization at both assessment points.",
25047290,"In contrast, no link was found between relational aggression and victimization for boys, although relational vulnerabilities did have unique associations with boys' relational victimization.",

21688275,"Furthermore, the effects of network characteristics (i.e., reciprocity and transitivity), gender, and social status on friendship selection were examined.",
21688275,"The starting assumption of this study was that selection effects based on aggression might have been overestimated in previous research as a result of failing to consider influence processes and alternative characteristics that steer friendship formation.",
21688275,"The results show that selection effects of both physical and relational aggression disappeared when network effects, gender, and social status were taken into account.",
21688275,"Particularly gender and perceived popularity appeared to be far more important determinants of friendship selection over time than aggression.",
21688275,"Moreover, a peer influence effect was only found for relational aggression, and not for physical aggression.",
21688275,"These findings suggest that similarity in aggression among befriended adolescents can be considered to be mainly a by-product rather than a leading dimension in friendship selection.",
