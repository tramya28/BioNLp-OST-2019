22829836,"Good outcomes depend on early presentation and appropriate referral.",
22829836,"This paper describes how the NHS Improvement Programme in England used service improvement methodologies to identify referral pathways and tools which were most likely to make significant improvements in diagnosing hearing loss, effective referrals and better patient outcomes.",
22829836,"An audiometric screening device was used in GP surgeries to enable thresholds for effective referrals to be measured in the surgery.",
22829836,"Revised referral criteria, the use of this device, new assess and fit technology in the audiology clinic, and direct access pathways can transform audiology service delivery so that patient outcomes are measurably better.",

29291191,"Introduction: Several studies have revealed an association between unemployment and ill health, and shown that unemployment can affect people differently.",
29291191,"This study aimed to provide an understanding of the experiences of unemployment and perceptions of wellbeing among persons who involuntary lost their work during the recent economic recession in Gavle Municipality.",
29291191,"Methods: Sixteen unemployed men and women aged 28-62 were interviewed face-to-face.",
29291191,"A purposeful sampling strategy was used in order to suit the research question and to increase the variation among informants.",
29291191,"The interview texts were analysed using thematic analysis.",
29291191,"Results: Six different themes emerged from the accounts: The respondents perceived work as the basis for belonging, and loss of work affected their social life and consumption patterns due to changes in their financial situation.",
29291191,"They also expressed feelings of isolation, loss of self-esteem, and feelings of hopelessness, which affected their physical well-being.",
29291191,"Longer duration of unemployment increased the respondents' negative emotions.",
29291191,"The respondents reported activities, structure, and affiliation in other contexts as part of their coping strategy against poor mental health.",
29291191,"Conclusions: After job loss, the respondents experienced feelings of loss of dignity and belonging as a human being.",
29291191,"They also felt worry, insecurity, and stress due to their changed financial situation, which in turn led to isolation and loss of self-esteem.",
29291191,"Social support and having other activities gave the respondents structure and meaning.",
23105170,"Disasters have been associated with both acute and prolonged distress and significant post-disaster psychiatric symptoms.",

23105170,"The present study investigated the relations between post-disaster loss of services and psychiatric symptoms in urban/non-urban disaster victims.",
23105170,"Random-digit-dial methodology was used to interview 1,249 victims of Hurricane Ike, a strong storm that hit Galveston, TX in 2008.",
23105170,"Findings demonstrated significant relations between loss of services and post-disaster symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and worry.",
23105170,"These relations varied by urban/non-urban settings; there were significant positive relations between loss of services and symptoms of depression in non-urban settings, but not in urban settings.",
23105170,"Similarly, a stronger relation between loss of services and symptoms of PTSD also was demonstrated in non-urban compared to urban settings.",

28772194,"Depression often is characterized by inflexible autonomic and metacognitive processes that interfere with effective self-regulation.",
28772194,"However, few studies have integrated these factors to improve the prediction of which individuals are at greatest risk for depression.",
28772194,"Among 134 undergraduates, we evaluated whether parasympathetic inflexibility (a lack of reduction in respiratory sinus arrhythmia) in response to a sadness induction involving loss would prospectively predict symptoms of depression across four waves of follow-up over twelve weeks.",
28772194,"Furthermore, we evaluated whether metacognitive components of perseverative cognition (PC) and decentering (identified by a principal component analysis) would moderate this relationship in opposite directions.",
28772194,"Multilevel modeling demonstrated that the relationship between parasympathetic inflexibility and prospective symptoms of depression was exacerbated by PC, but attenuated by decentering.",
28772194,"Furthermore, individuals with parasympathetic inflexibility, PC, and low decentering were at greatest risk for symptoms of depression across follow-up.",
28772194,"These results support the utility of integrating autonomic and metacognitive risk factors to identify individuals at risk for depression.",
21968572,"BACKGROUND: The association between specific sleeping disorders and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is unclear.",
21968572,"We assessed the association between sleep loss due to worry and future risk of CVD and death in a representative sample of community dwelling adults.",
21968572,"METHODS: A cohort of 11,905 adults (aged 53.4 +/- 12.2 years, 42.2% male) without known history of CVD were drawn from the Scottish Health Surveys.",
21968572,"Self-reported sleep disturbance was measured using a single item from the General Health Questionnaire.",
21968572,"Incident CVD events (comprising CVD death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary surgical procedures, stroke, and heart failure) over 8-year follow up were ascertained by a linkage to national registers; a total of 1448 CVD events and 1249 all-cause deaths were recorded.",
21968572,"RESULTS: 15.6% of the sample reported 'rather more' or 'much more than usual' sleep loss due to worry over the prior 4 weeks.",
21968572,"Sleep loss due to worry (much more than usual) was associated with elevated risk of CVD [age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35-2.25] and all-cause mortality (age- and sex-adjusted HR 2.02, 95% CI 1.57-2.61).",
21968572,"Adjustment for a range of psychosocial, behavioural, and clinical risk factors partly attenuated the association, and in particular health behaviours (smoking, alcohol, physical inactivity) accounted for approximately 40% of the sleep-CVD relation.",
21968572,"CONCLUSION: Sleep loss due to worry was associated with a greater risk of CVD and all-cause mortality, but the association can be largely explained by intermediate risk factors such as health behaviours.",
19068948,"Farm work involves seasonal peak busy periods with long hours of work and potential sleep loss.",
19068948,"Social, technological, and economic changes, and depressed commodity prices, have resulted in financial stress.",
19068948,"There may be a relationship between sleep loss and worry about economic conditions.",
19068948,"The objective of this study was to examine the association between hours of sleep and worry associated with cash flow shortages and worry associated with debt among a population of farmers and their family members.",
19068948,"One hundred and ninety-five persons from 94 active farms in two rural municipalities in west central Saskatchewan were interviewed by questionnaire.",
19068948,"Logistic regression analyses were used to quantify associations between sleep patterns and economic concerns during peak seasons and nonpeak seasons.",
19068948,"During peak agricultural seasons, 31.6% of owners/operators reported less than 6 hours of sleep per night compared to 6.3% during the nonpeak seasons (p< .01).",
19068948,"A significant relationship (odds ration [OR] 3.59, confidence interval [Cl] 1.58-8.13) was observed between daily cash flow worry and impaired sleep during peak busy seasons.",
19068948,"A large proportion of farmers surveyed suffered sleep deprivation during peak seasons, and this sleep loss appeared related to worries about cash flow that were not observed during nonpeak seasons.",
19068948,"It is possible that sleep loss during peak busy seasons may be related to impared judgment, as shown by differential worry habits, and might also be related to the high injury rates in farmers during peak busy seasons.",
25619113,"In this study, an ambiguous loss framework as described by Boss (1999, Ambiguous loss: Learning to live with unresolved grief, First Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA) was used to examine and understand the family experiences of Mexican immigrant agricultural workers in Minnesota.",
25619113,"Transcripts from interviews with 17 workers in Minnesota and 17 family members in Mexico were analyzed using qualitative methodology to identify experiences of ambiguous loss in the participants' narratives.",
25619113,"Key dimensions of ambiguous loss identified in the transcripts include: psychological family, feelings of chronic/recurring loss, finding support, and meaning making.",
25619113,"In the category of psychological family, participants in both Mexico and the United States mourned the physical absence of their family members and experienced ambiguity regarding family responsibilities, but worked to maintain their psychological roles within the family.",
25619113,"In the category of chronic/recurring loss, participants in both countries experienced chronic worry from not knowing if family members were safe, ambiguity regarding when the immigrant would return, and chronic stressors that compounded these feelings of loss.",
25619113,"Participants in both countries coped with both real and ambiguous losses by accessing family support and by using ambiguous communication to minimize worry.",
25619113,"Participants in Mexico also accessed work and community-based support.",
25619113,"Participants in both countries made meaning of the ambiguous loss by identifying ways their lives were improved and goals were met as a result of the immigration for agricultural work in Minnesota.",
26275507,"There is some evidence that adult separation anxiety disorder (ASAD) symptoms are closely associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) amongst refugees exposed to traumatic events (TEs), but the pathways involved remain to be elucidated.",

25140524,"Yet, the function of rumination in bereavement remains unclear.",
25140524,"In the past, researchers often assumed rumination to be a maladaptive confrontation process.",
25140524,"However, based on cognitive avoidance theories of worry in generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and rumination after post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), others have suggested that rumination may serve to avoid painful aspects of the loss, thereby contributing to complicated grief.",
25140524,"To examine if rumination is linked with loss avoidance, an eye-tracking study was conducted with 54 bereaved individuals (27 high and 27 low ruminators).",
25140524,"On 24 trials, participants looked for 10 seconds at a picture of the deceased and a picture of a stranger, randomly combined with negative, neutral or loss-related words.",
25140524,"High ruminators were expected to show initial vigilance followed by subsequent disengagement for loss stimuli (i.e., picture deceased with a loss word) in the first 1500 ms. Additionally, we expected high ruminators to avoid these loss stimuli and to show attentional preference for non-loss-related negative stimuli (i.e., picture stranger with a negative word) on longer exposure durations (1500-10000 ms).",
25140524,"Contrary to expectations, we found no evidence for an effect of rumination on vigilance and disengagement of loss stimuli in the first 1500 ms.",
25140524,"However, in the 1500-10000 ms interval, high ruminators showed shorter gaze times for loss stimuli and longer gaze times for negative (and neutral) non-loss-related stimuli, even when controlling for depression and complicated grief symptom levels.",

24854574,"The gradual loss of vision due to retinal diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), or glaucoma can contribute to the experience of negative psychosocial states, such as anxiety, stress, and depression, as well as diminished quality of life.",
24854574,"We hypothesize that VF testing elicits test performance anxiety and perception of functional losses of vision, which induces distracting negative thoughts that result in increased VF test variability.",
24854574,"Resources for processing and responding to vision-related information may be diverted from task-relevant VF stimuli to task-irrelevant ones, such as internal worry and test anxiety, thereby resulting in VF test performance decrements.",
