27576271,"Temporal phases of threat response, including potential threat (anxiety), acute threat (startle, fear), and post-threat response modulation, have been identified as the underlying markers of anxiety disorders.",
27576271,"Objective measures of response during these phases may help identify children at risk for anxiety; however, the complexity of current assessment techniques prevent their adoption in many research and clinical contexts.",
27576271,"We propose an alternative technology, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), that enables noninvasive measurement of the movements associated with threat response, and test its ability to detect threat response phases in young children at a heightened risk for developing anxiety.",
27576271,"We quantified the motion of 18 children (3-7 years old) during an anxiety-/fear-provoking behavioral task using an IMU.",
27576271,"Specifically, measurements from a single IMU secured to the child's waist were used to extract root-mean-square acceleration and angular velocity in the horizontal and vertical directions, and tilt and yaw range of motion during each threat response phase.",
27576271,"IMU measurements detected expected differences in child motion by threat phase.",
27576271,"Additionally, potential threat motion was positively correlated to familial anxiety risk, startle range of motion was positively correlated with child internalizing symptoms, and response modulation motion was negatively correlated to familial anxiety risk.",
27576271,"Results suggest differential theory-driven threat response phases and support previous literature connecting maternal child risk to anxiety with behavioral measures using more feasible objective methods.",
27576271,"This is the first study demonstrating the utility of an IMU for characterizing the motion of young children to mark the phases of threat response modulation.",
27576271,"The technique provides a novel and objective measure of threat response for mental health researchers.",
28599071,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by memory disturbances following trauma.",
28599071,"Acute predator threat has emerged as an ethological model of PTSD, yet the effects of predator odor on signaling cascades associated with long-term memory remain poorly understood.",
28599071,"In this study, we exposed male and female Wistar rats to the synthetic predator odor 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT) to assess behavioral and physiological responses as well as rapid modulation of signal transduction cascades associated with learning and memory in the male and female hippocampus.",
28599071,"During exposure to TMT in the homecage, both male and female animals displayed robust immobility, avoidance, and altered activity as a function of time.",
28599071,"Physiologically, TMT exposure increased circulating corticosterone and blood glucose in both male and female rodents, suggesting that TMT evokes sex-independent behavioral and physiological responses.",
28599071,"With respect to signal transduction, TMT exposure rapidly reduced phosphorylation of cyclic-adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB) in the male, but not the female hippocampus.",
28599071,"Furthermore, TMT exposure reduced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and increased nuclear expression of the synapto-nuclear messenger protein Jacob in the male hippocampus, consistent with activation of the CREB shut-off pathway.",
28599071,"In a follow-up behavioral experiment, post-training exposure to TMT did not affect spatial water maze performance of male rats.",
28599071,"However, male rats re-introduced to the context in which TMT had previously been presented displayed avoidance and hyperactivity, but not freezing behavior or elevated corticosterone responses, suggesting that TMT exposure supports a form of contextual conditioning which is not characterized by immobility.",
28599071,"Taken together, our findings suggest that TMT evokes similar behavioral and physiological responses in male and female Wistar rats, but affects distinct signaling cascades in the male and female hippocampus which may contribute to behavioral disruptions associated with predator exposure.",
27981438,"It is a widely observed finding that emotion and anxiety interact; highly stressed or anxious individuals show robust attentional biases towards external negative information.",
27981438,"More generally, research has suggested that exposure to threatening stimuli, as well as the experience of acute stress, also may impair top-down attentional control and working memory.",
27981438,"In the current study, we investigated how the influence of emotion and anxiety may interact to influence working memory performance.",
27981438,"Participants were required to encode the orientation of four simple shapes, eight, or four shapes while filtering out four other irrelevant shapes from memory.",
27981438,"Before memory displays, an irrelevant neutral or fearful face cue also was presented.",
27981438,"Memory performance was found to interact with self-reported state anxiety and cue valence; on neutral cue trials, state anxiety was negatively correlated with performance.",
27981438,"This effect was absent following a fear cue.",
27981438,"In addition, filtering efficiency was negatively associated with state anxiety solely following a fear cue.",
27981438,"Our findings suggest that state anxiety's influence to visual working memory can be strongly modulated by external signals to threat.",
27981438,"Most crucially, rather than anxious individuals having greater difficulty rejecting external threatening information, we observed that external threat may in its own right generally impair filtering efficiency in anxious individuals.",
16111764,"In light of the increasing threat of large-scale massacres such as terrorism against non-combatants (civilians), more attention is warranted not only to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but also to acute sociogenic pseudoneurological (conversion) symptoms, especially epidemic sociogenic symptoms.",
16111764,"We posit that conversion disorders are etiologically related to specific evolutionary pressures (inescapable threats to life) in the late stage of the human environment of evolutionary adaptedness (EEA).",
16111764,"Bracha et al.",
16111764,"have recently argued that from the neuroevolutionary perspective, medically unexplained efferent vasovagal syncope and medically unexplained craniofacial musculoskeletal pain in young otherwise healthy individuals, may be taxonomized as stress and fear-circuitry disorders.",
16111764,"In the present article, we extend neuroevolutionary perspectives to acute pseudoneurological sociogenic (conversive) symptoms: psychogenic non-epileptic attacks (pseudoseizures), epidemic sociogenic disorders (DSM-IV-TR Epidemic Hysteria), conversive motor deficits (pseudo-paralysis and pseudo-cerebellar symptoms), and psychogenic blindness.",
16111764,"We hypothesize that these perplexing pseudoneurological stress-triggered symptoms, which constitute psychopathology in extant humans, are traceable to allele-variant polymorphisms which spread during the Neolithic EEA.",
16111764,"During Neolithic warfare, conversive symptoms may have increased the survival odds for some non-combatants by visually (i.e., non-verbally) signaling to predatory conspecifics that one does not present a danger.",
16111764,"This is consistent with the age and sex pattern of conversive disorders.",
16111764,"Testable and falsifiable predictions are presented; e.g., at the genome-transcriptome interface, one of the major oligogenic loci involved in conversive spectrum disorders may carry a developmentally sensitive allele in a stable polymorphism (balanced polymorphism) in which the gene expression mechanism is gradually suppressed by pleiotropic androgens especially dehydroxyepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S).",
16111764,"Taxonomic implications for the much-needed rapprochement between the forthcoming Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) are discussed.",
17445017,"AIM: This paper reports a study to investigate the nature and prevalence of inpatient aggressive behaviour directed at staff and other patients and, in the case of patient self-harm, the methods used by nursing staff to manage this.",
17445017,"BACKGROUND: Aggressive behaviour poses a threat to the physical and psychological health of psychiatric nursing staff.",
17445017,"The fear that results from working in a climate of potential danger can also have a damaging impact on patient care.",
17445017,"METHODS: Nursing staff on five acute inpatient wards in one hospital in the United Kingdom collected data on aggressive incidents using the Staff Observation Aggression Scale - Revised during a 10 month period from June 2001 to April 2002.",
17445017,"RESULTS: There were 254 incidents of aggression recorded.",
17445017,"Staff were most commonly targeted and were involved in 57 x 1% of incidents.",
17445017,"The most frequent provocation of the aggression was the patient being denied something such as leave from the ward (29 x 5% of incidents).",
17445017,"The most frequent means used by patients was verbal aggression (60% of incidents), the most frequent outcome for the victim was feeling threatened (59% of incidents), and verbal interventions were used most frequently to manage the aggressive behaviour (43 x 7%).",
17445017,"Despite many incidents involving verbal aggression in both staff- and patient-targeted aggression, 35 x 9% of incidents involving staff and 25% of incidents involving other patients resulted in seclusion.",
17445017,"CONCLUSION: It is estimated that in a 12 month period at the hospital in this study a nurse would have a one in 10 chance per year of receiving any kind of injury as a result of patient aggression.",
17445017,"Despite the predominance of verbal over physical aggression, the fear generated from working in such an environment and a difficulty in understanding the causes of patient aggression may motivate staff to manage aggressive incidents with physical methods such as seclusion and restraint on a frequent basis.",
26613707,"This study identified predictors of anxiety and depression in patients with acute coronary syndrome.",
26613707,"Predictors included illness beliefs, fear/threat at the time of the cardiac event, threat reappraisal over time and social support.",
26613707,"A total of 97 participants completed questionnaires in hospital and 1- and 6-month follow-up.",
26613707,"Perceived threat and fear at the time of the cardiac event predicted affective response at both time points, partly mediated by threat reappraisal.",
26613707,"Contemporaneous measures of illness beliefs contributed additional variance, although not always in the predicted direction: high concern and control over the illness were associated with emotional distress.",
26613707,"Assessment of patients for risk of negative emotional outcomes of acute coronary syndrome needs to consider their beliefs about their illness and the degree of threat and fear experienced at the time of the event.",
26613707,"Interventions need to help people cope with negative emotional states as well as challenging inappropriate illness beliefs.",
25365751,"Fear is a psychological construct inherent in assessment of and reaction to threat.",
25365751,"Its expression has been associated with individual differences in temperament, personality, and behavioral inhibition.",
25365751,"Defining and subsequently assessing these individual differences in fear as a trait-like variable, however, have been largely neglected by researchers.",
25365751,"Although there are well-established measures of fear, these primarily assess response to phobic stimuli rather than a reaction tendency to acute fear.",
25365751,"As such, the goals of the present studies were to create, pilot, and revise a scale to assess the general construct of trait-like response to fear as it relates to underlying individual differences.",
25365751,"Following guidelines for scale development, outlined by Haynes, Richard, and Kubany (1995 [Content validity in psychological assessment: A functional approach to concepts and methods.",
25365751,"Psychological Assessment, 7, 238-247]) results of the current investigation provide strong, initial support for the factor structure, reliability, and construct validity of a new measure of trait-like fear: the Fight, Flight, Freeze questionnaire.",
26991018,"The amygdala has been shown to be essential for the processing of acute and learned fear across animal species.",
26991018,"However, the downstream neural circuits that mediate these fear responses differ according to the nature of the threat, with separate pathways having been identified for predator, conspecific and physically harmful threats.",
26991018,"In particular, the dorsomedial part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VHMdm) is critical for the expression of defensive responses to predators.",
26991018,"Here, we tested the hypothesis that this circuit also participates in predator fear memory by transient pharmacogenetic inhibition of the VMHdm and its downstream effector, the dorsal periaqueductal grey, during predator fear learning in the mouse.",
26991018,"Our data demonstrate that neural activity in the VMHdm is required for both the acquisition and recall of predator fear memory, whereas that of its downstream effector, the dorsal periaqueductal grey, is required only for the acute expression of fear.",
26991018,"These findings are consistent with a role for the medial hypothalamus in encoding an internal emotional state of fear.",
19782055,"Stress is most often associated with aversive states.",
19782055,"It rapidly induces the release of hormones and neuropeptides including dynorphin, which activates kappa opioid receptors (KORs) in the central and peripheral nervous systems.",
19782055,"In animal models, many aversive effects of stress are mimicked or exacerbated by stimulation of KORs in limbic brain regions.",
19782055,"Although KOR signaling during acute stress may increase physical ability (by producing analgesia) and motivation to escape a threat (by producing aversion), prolonged KOR signaling in response to chronic or uncontrollable stress can lead to persistent expression of behavioral signs that are characteristic of human depressive disorders (i.e., prodepressive-like signs).",
19782055,"Accumulating evidence suggests that KORs contribute to the progressive amplification (sensitization) of stress-induced behaviors that occurs with repeated exposure to stress.",
19782055,"Many of the aversive effects of stress are blocked by KOR antagonists, suggesting that these agents may have potential as therapeutics for stress-related conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders.",
19782055,"This review summarizes current data on how KOR systems contribute to the acute (rapid), delayed, and cumulative molecular and behavioral effects of stress.",
19782055,"We focus on behavioral paradigms that provide insight on interactions between stress and KOR function within each of these temporal categories.",
19782055,"Using a simplified model, we consider the time course and mechanism of KOR-mediated effects in stress and suggest future directions that may be useful in determining whether KOR antagonists exert their therapeutic effects by preventing the development of stress-induced behaviors, the expression of stress-induced behaviors, or both.",
26877119,"In the current review, we reconceptualize a categorical diagnosis-panic disorder and agoraphobia-in terms of two constructs within the domain negative valence systems suggested by the Research Domain Criteria initiative.",
26877119,"Panic attacks are considered as abrupt and intense fear responses to acute threat arising from inside the body, while anxious apprehension refers to anxiety responses to potential harm and more distant or uncertain threat.",
26877119,"Taking a dimensional view, panic disorder with agoraphobia is defined with the threat-imminence model stating that defensive responses are dynamically organized along the dimension of the proximity of the threat.",
26877119,"We tested this model within a large group of patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia (N = 369 and N = 124 in a replication sample) and found evidence that panic attacks are indeed instances of circa strike defense.",
26877119,"This component of the defensive reactivity was related to genetic modulators within the serotonergic system.",
26877119,"In contrast, anxious apprehension-characterized by attentive freezing during postencounter defense-was related to general distress and depressive mood, as well as to genetic modulations within the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.",
26877119,"Patients with a strong behavioral tendency for active and passive avoidance responded better to exposure treatment if the therapist guides the patient through the exposure exercises.",
22390711,"Factors leading humans to shift attention away from danger cues remain poorly understood.",
22390711,"Two laboratory experiments reported here show that context interacts with learning experiences to shape attention avoidance of mild danger cues.",
22390711,"The first experiment exposed 18 participants to contextual threat of electric shock.",
22390711,"Attention allocation to mild danger cues was then assessed with the dot-probe task.",
22390711,"Results showed that contextual threat caused subjects to avert attention from danger cues.",
22390711,"In the second experiment, 36 participants were conditioned to the same contextual threat used in Experiment 1.",
22390711,"These subjects then were randomly assigned to either an experimental group, trained to shift attention toward danger cues, or a placebo group exposed to the same stimuli without the training component.",
22390711,"As in Experiment 1, contextual threat again caused attention allocation away from danger in the control group.",
22390711,"However, this did not occur in the experimental group.",
22390711,"These experiments show that acute contextual threat and learning experiences interact to shape the deployment of attention away from danger cues.",
21122818,"Alcohol is a known exogenous modulator of negative affect (anxiety, tension) in both animals and humans.",
21122818,"It has been proposed that the anxiolytic effects of alcohol are mediated via the amygdala, an area critical to fear perception and responding.",
21122818,"However, little is known about the acute effects of alcohol on amygdala reactivity to threatening information in humans.",
21122818,"We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a validated task to probe amygdala responses to social signals of threat in 12 healthy, social drinkers after a double-blind crossover administration of alcohol or placebo.",
21122818,"We found that alcohol significantly reduced amygdala reactivity to threat signals.",
21122818,"The current findings fit well with the notion that alcohol may attenuate threat-based responding and provide a potential brain-based mechanism for the link between alcohol and anxiety and/or social threat perception.",
17259206,"We have previously shown that a single dose of intravenous citalopram in healthy volunteers enhances the detection of fearful facial expressions, suggesting an effect of acute selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment on the processing of anxiety-related stimuli.",
17259206,"The aim of the present study was to confirm and extend this finding by studying the effects of a single dose of oral citalopram on a range of tasks designed to assess different aspects of emotional processing.",
17259206,"A total of 32 healthy volunteers were randomly allocated to double-blind treatment with either citalopram 20 mg orally or placebo.",
17259206,"Participants then completed a series of tasks assessing emotional aspects of attention (visual-probe task), perception (categorization of facial affect), memory (emotional memory task) and reactivity to threat (emotion potentiated startle).",
17259206,"Relative to placebo-treated subjects, participants treated with citalopram demonstrated improved recognition of fearful faces and increased baseline startle response.",
17259206,"However, the citalopram group also showed an attentional bias towards positive words.",
17259206,"Our data suggest that acute oral citalopram increases the processing of anxiety-related stimuli in healthy volunteers.",
17259206,"This mechanism could underlie the known tendency of SSRIs to increase anxiety in patients early in treatment.",
17259206,"Our data also suggests that some of the positive biases in emotional processing produced by SSRI treatment might be detectable at the beginning of treatment.",
16298490,"The aims of this study were threefold.",
16298490,"Firstly, to investigate the effect of increasing threat-expectancy on attentional biases towards pain-related words.",
16298490,"Secondly, to determine the interaction between threat-expectancy and the effectiveness of two coping strategies on pain threshold and tolerance.",
16298490,"Thirdly, to investigate the relationship between fear of pain and the experimental manipulations.",
16298490,"One hundred undergraduate psychology students were randomly assigned to receive either threat-increasing or reassuring information about the cold pressor task.",
16298490,"After reading the information, all participants completed the dot-probe task for four categories of pain-related words.",
16298490,"Following the dot-probe task, participants were randomly allocated to one of two coping strategy conditions (focusing on affective vs sensory aspects of pain).",
16298490,"Participants then completed the cold pressor task while engaging in the relevant coping strategy.",
16298490,"There was a significant effect of threat on bias towards affective vs sensory pain words.",
16298490,"Participants in the threat condition showed a stronger bias towards affective pain words.",
16298490,"In contrast, the no-threat condition displayed a stronger bias towards sensory pain words.",
16298490,"Significant interaction effects were observed between threat and coping strategy for threshold and tolerance.",
16298490,"These results indicated that focusing on sensory pain sensations was helpful in the absence of threat, however, in the presence of threat was relatively unhelpful in comparison to focusing on the affective components of pain.",
16298490,"The present results provide support for the fear-avoidance model of pain [Vlaeyen JWS, Linton SJ.",

28117048,"BACKGROUND: Studies suggest that exaggerated amygdala reactivity is a vulnerability factor for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); however, our understanding is limited by a paucity of prospective, longitudinal studies.",
28117048,"Recent studies in healthy samples indicate that, relative to reactivity, habituation is a more reliable biomarker of individual differences in amygdala function.",
28117048,"We investigated reactivity of the amygdala and cortical areas to repeated threat presentations in a prospective study of PTSD.",
28117048,"METHODS: Participants were recruited from the emergency department of a large level I trauma center within 24 hours of trauma.",
28117048,"PTSD symptoms were assessed at baseline and approximately 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after trauma.",
28117048,"Growth curve modeling was used to estimate symptom recovery trajectories.",
28117048,"Thirty-one individuals participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging around the 1-month assessment, passively viewing fearful and neutral face stimuli.",
28117048,"Reactivity (fearful > neutral) and habituation to fearful faces was examined.",
28117048,"RESULTS: Amygdala reactivity, but not habituation, 5 to 12 weeks after trauma was positively associated with the PTSD symptom intercept and predicted symptoms at 12 months after trauma.",
28117048,"Habituation in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex was positively associated with the slope of PTSD symptoms, such that decreases in ventral anterior cingulate cortex activation over repeated presentations of fearful stimuli predicted increasing symptoms.",
28117048,"CONCLUSIONS: Findings point to neural signatures of risk for maintaining PTSD symptoms after trauma exposure.",
28117048,"Specifically, chronic symptoms were predicted by amygdala hyperreactivity, and poor recovery was predicted by a failure to maintain ventral anterior cingulate cortex activation in response to fearful stimuli.",
28117048,"The importance of identifying patients at risk after trauma exposure is discussed.",
28025095,"Deficits in fear extinction learning are hypothesized to underlie the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",
28025095,"Such deficits may, in part, be due to genetic and epigenetic variation in the stress related gene FKBP5.",
28025095,"Conversely, altering FKBP5 epigenetic responses during memory consolidation may rescue extinction deficits making it a target for acute intervention to prevent the development of PTSD.",
28025095,"Study 1 (Humans) examines if FKBP5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and PTSD symptom domains (re-experiencing, avoidance/numbing, hyperarousal) are associated with abnormal fear extinction phenotypes identified using latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM).",
28025095,"Study 2 (Mice) tests if increasing doses of dexamethasone administered prior to extinction alters Fkbp5 mRNA production in the amygdala after extinction and recall and prevents the development of abnormal extinction phenotypes.",
28025095,"In humans, abnormal extinction was associated with the TT homozygous genotype of FKBP5 SNPs RS9470080 and RS1360780, and hyperarousal symptoms.",
28025095,"In mice, dexamethasone 300 mug/kg was associated with increased amygdala Fkbp5 mRNA following extinction and robust extinction learning while lower doses were not associated with amygdala Fkbp5 mRNA or differences in extinction learning.",
28025095,"Further, mice that extinguished on dexamethasone 300 mug/kg maintained low levels of freezing behavior during recall training while mRNA levels were no longer elevated.",
28025095,"Together, findings indicate that FKBP5 confers risk for fear extinction deficits.",
28025095,"However, this risk may be ameliorated by increasing fkbp5 mRNA expression in the amygdala during memory consolidation making this mechanism a plausible point of acute intervention to prevent the development of PTSD.",
22362395,"OBJECTIVE: Many studies have shown that 5-HTTLPR genotype interacts with exposure to stress in conferring risk for psychopathology.",
22362395,"However, the specific neural mechanisms through which this gene-by-environment interaction confers risk remain largely unknown, and no study to date has directly examined the modulatory effects of 5-HTTLPR on corticolimbic circuit responses during exposure to acute stress.",
22362395,"METHOD: An acute laboratory stressor was administered to 51 healthy women during blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging.",
22362395,"In this task, participants were threatened with electric shocks of uncertain intensity, which were unpredictably delivered to the wrist after a long anticipatory cue period of unpredictable duration.",
22362395,"RESULTS: Relative to women carrying the L allele, those with the SS genotype showed enhanced activation during threat anticipation in a network of regions, including the amygdala, hippocampus, anterior insula, thalamus, pulvinar, caudate, precuneus, anterior cingulate cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex.",
22362395,"Individuals with the SS genotype also displayed enhanced positive coupling between medial prefrontal cortex activation and anxiety experience, whereas enhanced negative coupling between insula activation and perceived success at regulating anxiety was observed in individuals carrying the L allele.",
22362395,"CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that during stress exposure, neural systems that enhance fear and arousal, modulate attention toward threat, and perseverate on emotional salience of the threat may be engaged preferentially in individuals with the SS genotype.",
22362395,"This may be one mechanism underlying the risk for psychopathology conferred by the S allele upon exposure to life stressors.",
21277566,"BACKGROUND: The debilitating effects of chronic glucocorticoids excess are well-known, but comparatively little is understood about the role of acute cortisol.",
21277566,"Indirect evidence in rodents suggests that acute cortisone could selectively increase some forms of long-duration aversive states, such as anxiety, but not relatively similar, briefer aversive states, such as fear.",
21277566,"However, no prior experimental studies in humans consider the unique effects of cortisol on anxiety and fear, using well-validated methods for eliciting these two similar but dissociable aversive states.",
21277566,"The current study examines these effects, as instantiated with short- and long-duration threats.",
21277566,"METHODS: Healthy volunteers (n = 18) received placebo or a low (20 mg) or a high (60 mg) dose of hydrocortisone in a double-blind crossover design.",
21277566,"Subjects were exposed repeatedly to three 150-sec duration conditions: no shock; predictable shocks, in which shocks were signaled by a short-duration threat cue; and unpredictable shocks.",
21277566,"Aversive states were indexed by acoustic startle.",
21277566,"Fear was operationally defined as the increase in startle reactivity during the threat cue in the predictable condition (fear-potentiated startle).",
21277566,"Anxiety was operationally defined as the increase in baseline startle from the no shock to the two threat conditions (anxiety-potentiated startle).",
21277566,"RESULTS: Hydrocortisone affected neither baseline nor short-duration, fear-potentiated startle but increased long-duration anxiety-potentiated startle.",
21277566,"CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that hydrocortisone administration in humans selectively increases anxiety but not fear.",
21277566,"Possible mechanisms implicated are discussed in light of prior data in rodents.",
21277566,"Specifically, hydrocortisone might increase anxiety via sensitization of corticotrophin-releasing hormones in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis.",
26877132,"The National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative calls for the incorporation of neurobiological approaches and findings into conceptions of mental health problems through a focus on biobehavioral constructs investigated across multiple domains of measurement (units of analysis).",
26877132,"Although the constructs in the RDoC system are characterized in process terms (i.e., as functional concepts with brain and behavioral referents), these constructs can also be framed as dispositions (i.e., as dimensions of variation in biobehavioral functioning across individuals).",
26877132,"Focusing on one key RDoC construct, acute threat or fear, the current article illustrates a construct-oriented psychoneurometric strategy for operationalizing this construct in individual difference terms-as threat sensitivity (THT+).",
26877132,"Utilizing data from 454 adult participants, we demonstrate empirically that (a) a scale measure of THT+ designed to tap general fear/fearlessness predicts effectively to relevant clinical problems (i.e., fear disorder symptoms), (b) this scale measure shows reliable associations with physiological indices of acute reactivity to aversive visual stimuli, and (c) a cross-domain factor reflecting the intersection of scale and physiological indicators of THT+ predicts effectively to both clinical and neurophysiological criterion measures.",
26877132,"Results illustrate how the psychoneurometric approach can be used to create a dimensional index of a biobehavioral trait construct, in this case THT+, which can serve as a bridge between phenomena in domains of psychopathology and neurobiology.",
26877132,"Implications and future directions are discussed with reference to the RDoC initiative and existing report-based conceptions of psychological traits.",
