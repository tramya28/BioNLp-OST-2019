20424047	Positive and negative affects high in motivational intensity cause a narrowing of attentional focus.
22148994	"Hypothesizing that genetic factors partially govern sensitivity to interpersonal cues, we examined whether a polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) in the serotonin transporter gene would moderate spouses' sensitivity to positive and negative partner affect."
22148994	These data support the contention that the serotonin system influences affective responses to social stimuli.
22562463	Individual affect-related performance zones (IAPZs) method utilizing Kamata et al.
22562463	"To do so, three male golfers of a varsity golf team were observed during three rounds of golf competition."
23646134	"Interestingly, individuals with low-HRV showed less differentiation in ASR between affective states."
23646134	"Furthermore, resting HRV was associated with affect-modulated characteristics of ASR, but not with SCR or HR."
23896304	"Depression-related general distress symptoms (e.g., sadness, worthlessness) predicted greater abstinence-induced increases in acute depressed affect only (betas .24-.25)."
23896304	CONCLUSION: Different components of anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with unique affective patterns of acute tobacco withdrawal.
24835467	"This framework implies quantifiable and testable inferences about affect from fMRI data, which may ultimately inform predictions about approach and avoidance behavior."
24835467	"Here, we suggest that the spatial and temporal resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data could support inferences about affective states."
25556211	"In combination, they indicate both additive and interactive influences of trait and state affect on top-down control of attention."
25701720	"At each alert, a short questionnaire was filled in, asking questions about passage of present time, affective state, arousal level, and attention to current activities, among others."
25701720	"Many people accept the idea that time seems to pass more quickly as they get older, as if this is a psychological reality."
25773637	"Producing and perceiving music engage a wide range of sensorimotor, cognitive, and emotional processes."
25773637	"However, besides joy or sadness, music often elicits feelings of wonder, nostalgia, or tenderness, which do not correspond to emotion categories typically studied in neuroscience and whose neural substrates remain largely unknown."
26214569	"Previous findings indirectly suggest that the more people perceive their time in life as limited, the more they value calm."
26751631	We conducted 3 studies to examine whether leaders' smiles reflect these cultural differences in ideal affect.
26751631	"Together, these findings suggest that leaders' smiles reflect the affective states valued by their cultures."
26876723	The neural correlates of human emotions are easy to harvest.
26876723	"The implications of this knowledge for development of new psychiatric interventions, especially depression, are discussed."
26884121	"We used infrared thermography, a non-invasive method, to assess physiological arousal during open field and elevated plus maze tests in mice."
26884121	"Due to their direct inaccessibility, affective states are classically assessed by gathering concomitant physiological and behavioral measures."
28463060	These results demonstrate key differences in audiovisual integration between valence and arousal.
28463060	Experiment 2 included a parallel combination of three levels of arousal while holding valence constant.
28604043	No study has investigated how executive control processes involved in perspective shifting relate to emotional empathy.
28611707	Differences also appeared for all other measured dimensions.
28611707	The ANPST is the first Polish language list of sentence stimuli and could easily be adapted for other languages and cultures.
28986700	when subjects were alone versus in company of others without direct social interaction or feedback.
28986700	This difference might be explained by a shift of attention in the presence of others.
29321533	Embodied theories of emotion assume that emotional processing is grounded in bodily and affective processes.
29321533	"Critically, participants were tested in two conditions: with experimentally induced high heart rate (Exercise) and with normal heart rate (Normal)."
29939058	"Prior research has indicated that ideal affect (i.e., the affective states that people value and would ideally like to experience) may be relevant to mental health outcomes."
30448351	The aim of the current study was to investigate if startle methodology is suitable to reflect urinary urgency.
30684514	We measured responses during recovery from stress and during reactivity to threat and anger.
30684514	Positive affect has been related to faster cardiovascular recovery from stress.
30718450	These findings may have implications for the therapeutic efficacy of DBS.
30718450	"Affective states underlie daily decision-making and pathological behaviours relevant to obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD), mood disorders and addictions."
30848050	SIGNIFICANCE: These results extend previous findings about common representational coding between the experience of first-hand and others' pain.
30848050	"Here we investigated whether representations of first-hand pain and disgust influenced the subsequent evaluation of facial expressions in Modality-specific fashion, or in terms of Unpleasantness or arousal."
