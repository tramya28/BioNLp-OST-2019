15212970	No significant effect was observed with epinastine and cetirizine on [(3)H]mepyramine binding.
15212970	These findings suggest that the differences in the central nervous system (CNS) depressant effect observed in second generation H(1) receptor antagonists may be due to their liability to penetrate into the CNS.

19246384	Hypothalamic neurons that contain the neuropeptide orexin (hypocretin) play important roles in the regulation of sleep/wake.
19246384	This increase in GABA(A)-mediated inhibitory tone is apparently the result of an orexin receptor type 1-mediated activation of local GABAergic interneurons that project back onto orexin neurons.
20128854	Polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA NCAM) is a transmembrane protein that has been implicated in various forms of plasticity.
20128854	"Recent evidence suggests that synaptic plasticity occurs during homeostatic processes, including sleep-wakefulness regulation, although the underlying mechanisms are not well understood."
20969999	Daily cycles of wakefulness and sleep are regulated by coordinated interactions between wakefulness- and sleep-regulating neural circuitry.
20969999	Each of these neuronal groups subserves distinct aspects of wakefulness-related functions of the brain.
21647372	"Using this system, we successfully activated and suppressed orexin neurons as measured by Fos staining."
21647372	Inhibition of orexin neurons decreased wakefulness time and increased NREM sleep time.
22401482	"It is estimated that 15 to 25% of the U.S. labor force works night, evening, or rotating shifts."
22401482	"These non-traditional schedules can affect the circadian rhythm, a self-sustained rhythm of biological processes that plays an important role in modulating sleep/wake function, resulting in circadian rhythm sleep disorder, shift work type, usually referred to as shift work disorder."
22573754	On the basis of results obtained in these conditions we can conclude that brain muscarinic cholinergic system normal functioning is significant for basic mechanisms of sleep-wakefulness cycle.
22573754	Problem is very topical because the question about the intimate aspects of BMChS involvement in PS maintaining mechanisms still remains unsolved.
23401916	"The questions of phylo-, ontogenetic formation of dopaminergic system regulating role in sleep-wakefulness cycle, when transition mainly from neurosecretory diencephalic influences of dophamine to the mainly neurotransmittory functins of telencephalic regions occured, is discussed."
