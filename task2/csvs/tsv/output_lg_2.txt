Acute_Threat_Fear
27576271	Temporal phases of threat response, including potential threat (anxiety), acute threat (startle, fear), and post-threat response modulation, have been identified as the underlying markers of anxiety disorders.
27576271	Objective measures of response during these phases may help identify children at risk for anxiety; however, the complexity of current assessment techniques prevent their adoption in many research and clinical contexts.
27576271	We propose an alternative technology, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), that enables noninvasive measurement of the movements associated with threat response, and test its ability to detect threat response phases in young children at a heightened risk for developing anxiety.
28599071	Acute predator threat has emerged as an ethological model of PTSD, yet the effects of predator odor on signaling cascades associated with long-term memory remain poorly understood.
28599071	In this study, we exposed male and female Wistar rats to the synthetic predator odor 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT) to assess behavioral and physiological responses as well as rapid modulation of signal transduction cascades associated with learning and memory in the male and female hippocampus.
28599071	However, male rats re-introduced to the context in which TMT had previously been presented displayed avoidance and hyperactivity, but not freezing behavior or elevated corticosterone responses, suggesting that TMT exposure supports a form of contextual conditioning which is not characterized by immobility.
28599071	Taken together, our findings suggest that TMT evokes similar behavioral and physiological responses in male and female Wistar rats, but affects distinct signaling cascades in the male and female hippocampus which may contribute to behavioral disruptions associated with predator exposure.
27981438	More generally, research has suggested that exposure to threatening stimuli, as well as the experience of acute stress, also may impair top-down attentional control and working memory.
27981438	In the current study, we investigated how the influence of emotion and anxiety may interact to influence working memory performance.
16111764	In light of the increasing threat of large-scale massacres such as terrorism against non-combatants (civilians), more attention is warranted not only to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but also to acute sociogenic pseudoneurological (conversion) symptoms, especially epidemic sociogenic symptoms.
26613707	Predictors included illness beliefs, fear/threat at the time of the cardiac event, threat reappraisal over time and social support.
26613707	Perceived threat and fear at the time of the cardiac event predicted affective response at both time points, partly mediated by threat reappraisal.
26613707	Assessment of patients for risk of negative emotional outcomes of acute coronary syndrome needs to consider their beliefs about their illness and the degree of threat and fear experienced at the time of the event.
25365751	As such, the goals of the present studies were to create, pilot, and revise a scale to assess the general construct of trait-like response to fear as it relates to underlying individual differences.
26991018	However, the downstream neural circuits that mediate these fear responses differ according to the nature of the threat, with separate pathways having been identified for predator, conspecific and physically harmful threats.
26991018	Here, we tested the hypothesis that this circuit also participates in predator fear memory by transient pharmacogenetic inhibition of the VMHdm and its downstream effector, the dorsal periaqueductal grey, during predator fear learning in the mouse.
26991018	Our data demonstrate that neural activity in the VMHdm is required for both the acquisition and recall of predator fear memory, whereas that of its downstream effector, the dorsal periaqueductal grey, is required only for the acute expression of fear.
19782055	Using a simplified model, we consider the time course and mechanism of KOR-mediated effects in stress and suggest future directions that may be useful in determining whether KOR antagonists exert their therapeutic effects by preventing the development of stress-induced behaviors, the expression of stress-induced behaviors, or both.
26877119	Panic attacks are considered as abrupt and intense fear responses to acute threat arising from inside the body, while anxious apprehension refers to anxiety responses to potential harm and more distant or uncertain threat.
26877119	In contrast, anxious apprehension-characterized by attentive freezing during postencounter defense-was related to general distress and depressive mood, as well as to genetic modulations within the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
21122818	We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a validated task to probe amygdala responses to social signals of threat in 12 healthy, social drinkers after a double-blind crossover administration of alcohol or placebo.
21122818	The current findings fit well with the notion that alcohol may attenuate threat-based responding and provide a potential brain-based mechanism for the link between alcohol and anxiety and/or social threat perception.
17259206	We have previously shown that a single dose of intravenous citalopram in healthy volunteers enhances the detection of fearful facial expressions, suggesting an effect of acute selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment on the processing of anxiety-related stimuli.
17259206	The aim of the present study was to confirm and extend this finding by studying the effects of a single dose of oral citalopram on a range of tasks designed to assess different aspects of emotional processing.
17259206	Participants then completed a series of tasks assessing emotional aspects of attention (visual-probe task), perception (categorization of facial affect), memory (emotional memory task) and reactivity to threat (emotion potentiated startle).
16298490	Firstly, to investigate the effect of increasing threat-expectancy on attentional biases towards pain-related words.
16298490	These results indicated that focusing on sensory pain sensations was helpful in the absence of threat, however, in the presence of threat was relatively unhelpful in comparison to focusing on the affective components of pain.
16298490	Pain 2000;85:317-332] and confirm the importance of threat-expectancy in hypervigilance towards pain and fear avoidance.
28117048	We investigated reactivity of the amygdala and cortical areas to repeated threat presentations in a prospective study of PTSD.
28117048	Habituation in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex was positively associated with the slope of PTSD symptoms, such that decreases in ventral anterior cingulate cortex activation over repeated presentations of fearful stimuli predicted increasing symptoms.
28025095	However, this risk may be ameliorated by increasing fkbp5 mRNA expression in the amygdala during memory consolidation making this mechanism a plausible point of acute intervention to prevent the development of PTSD.
22362395	However, the specific neural mechanisms through which this gene-by-environment interaction confers risk remain largely unknown, and no study to date has directly examined the modulatory effects of 5-HTTLPR on corticolimbic circuit responses during exposure to acute stress.
22362395	In this task, participants were threatened with electric shocks of uncertain intensity, which were unpredictably delivered to the wrist after a long anticipatory cue period of unpredictable duration.
22362395	RESULTS: Relative to women carrying the L allele, those with the SS genotype showed enhanced activation during threat anticipation in a network of regions, including the amygdala, hippocampus, anterior insula, thalamus, pulvinar, caudate, precuneus, anterior cingulate cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex.
22362395	CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that during stress exposure, neural systems that enhance fear and arousal, modulate attention toward threat, and perseverate on emotional salience of the threat may be engaged preferentially in individuals with the SS genotype.
21277566	The current study examines these effects, as instantiated with short- and long-duration threats.
21277566	Subjects were exposed repeatedly to three 150-sec duration conditions: no shock; predictable shocks, in which shocks were signaled by a short-duration threat cue; and unpredictable shocks.
21277566	Fear was operationally defined as the increase in startle reactivity during the threat cue in the predictable condition (fear-potentiated startle).
21277566	CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that hydrocortisone administration in humans selectively increases anxiety but not fear.
26877132	Focusing on one key RDoC construct, acute threat or fear, the current article illustrates a construct-oriented psychoneurometric strategy for operationalizing this construct in individual difference terms-as threat sensitivity (THT+).
26877132	Utilizing data from 454 adult participants, we demonstrate empirically that (a) a scale measure of THT+ designed to tap general fear/fearlessness predicts effectively to relevant clinical problems (i.e., fear disorder symptoms), (b) this scale measure shows reliable associations with physiological indices of acute reactivity to aversive visual stimuli, and (c) a cross-domain factor reflecting the intersection of scale and physiological indicators of THT+ predicts effectively to both clinical and neurophysiological criterion measures.
26877132	Results illustrate how the psychoneurometric approach can be used to create a dimensional index of a biobehavioral trait construct, in this case THT+, which can serve as a bridge between phenomena in domains of psychopathology and neurobiology.
Loss
22829836	The public health challenge of hearing impairment is growing, as age is the major determinant of hearing loss.
22829836	This paper describes how the NHS Improvement Programme in England used service improvement methodologies to identify referral pathways and tools which were most likely to make significant improvements in diagnosing hearing loss, effective referrals and better patient outcomes.
30132909	AIM: The aim of this article is to describe the concept of anticipatory loss in adult children for independent aging parents.
30132909	Worry about future loss is tempered by gratitude for current parental good health.
30132909	CONCLUSIONS: Anticipating the loss of a healthy aging parent is different from existing conceptualizations of anticipatory loss and related concepts.
29291191	This study aimed to provide an understanding of the experiences of unemployment and perceptions of wellbeing among persons who involuntary lost their work during the recent economic recession in Gavle Municipality.
29291191	Results: Six different themes emerged from the accounts: The respondents perceived work as the basis for belonging, and loss of work affected their social life and consumption patterns due to changes in their financial situation.
29291191	They also expressed feelings of isolation, loss of self-esteem, and feelings of hopelessness, which affected their physical well-being.
29291191	Conclusions: After job loss, the respondents experienced feelings of loss of dignity and belonging as a human being.
29291191	They also felt worry, insecurity, and stress due to their changed financial situation, which in turn led to isolation and loss of self-esteem.
23105170	The present study investigated the relations between post-disaster loss of services and psychiatric symptoms in urban/non-urban disaster victims.
23105170	Findings demonstrated significant relations between loss of services and post-disaster symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and worry.
28772194	Among 134 undergraduates, we evaluated whether parasympathetic inflexibility (a lack of reduction in respiratory sinus arrhythmia) in response to a sadness induction involving loss would prospectively predict symptoms of depression across four waves of follow-up over twelve weeks.
21968572	We assessed the association between sleep loss due to worry and future risk of CVD and death in a representative sample of community dwelling adults.
21968572	RESULTS: 15.6% of the sample reported 'rather more' or 'much more than usual' sleep loss due to worry over the prior 4 weeks.
21968572	CONCLUSION: Sleep loss due to worry was associated with a greater risk of CVD and all-cause mortality, but the association can be largely explained by intermediate risk factors such as health behaviours.
19068948	Farm work involves seasonal peak busy periods with long hours of work and potential sleep loss.
19068948	There may be a relationship between sleep loss and worry about economic conditions.
19068948	The objective of this study was to examine the association between hours of sleep and worry associated with cash flow shortages and worry associated with debt among a population of farmers and their family members.
19068948	A large proportion of farmers surveyed suffered sleep deprivation during peak seasons, and this sleep loss appeared related to worries about cash flow that were not observed during nonpeak seasons.
19068948	It is possible that sleep loss during peak busy seasons may be related to impared judgment, as shown by differential worry habits, and might also be related to the high injury rates in farmers during peak busy seasons.
25619113	In this study, an ambiguous loss framework as described by Boss (1999, Ambiguous loss: Learning to live with unresolved grief, First Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA) was used to examine and understand the family experiences of Mexican immigrant agricultural workers in Minnesota.
25619113	Key dimensions of ambiguous loss identified in the transcripts include: psychological family, feelings of chronic/recurring loss, finding support, and meaning making.
25619113	In the category of chronic/recurring loss, participants in both countries experienced chronic worry from not knowing if family members were safe, ambiguity regarding when the immigrant would return, and chronic stressors that compounded these feelings of loss.
25619113	Participants in both countries made meaning of the ambiguous loss by identifying ways their lives were improved and goals were met as a result of the immigration for agricultural work in Minnesota.
26275507	We examined a path model testing whether ASAD symptoms and worry about family mediated the path from traumatic losses to PTSD symptoms amongst 230 refugees from West Papua.
26275507	A structural equation model indicated that ASAD symptoms played an important role in mediating the effects of traumatic losses and worry about family in the pathway to PTSD symptoms.
19347691	This study tested prospective models of anxiety and depression following a first time diagnosis of age-related hearing loss, also known as presbycusis, which is one of the most common and disabling health problems in the world.
19347691	Additionally, the interaction of CSC and anxiety and depression symptoms at T2 was expected to predict significant variance in measures of anxiety and depression at T3, even after baseline levels of distress were controlled in regression models.
19347691	Finally, it was hypothesized that consistent use of a hearing aid by T3 would act as a palliative to reduce distress in response to hearing loss at T3.
19347691	Results were partially consistent with hypotheses and point to a new direction in preventing anxiety and depression following a first time diagnosis of presbycusis.
24885591	The common psychological experiences participants reported included frustration, worry, loss of identity, embarrassment, and in some participants, a healthy defiance against the disease.
19762138	Using two longitudinal and nationally representative datasets, this study employs a cross-cohort analysis to examine age, cohort and period effects in the prevalence of sleep loss through worry for people over the age of 50 in the UK.
19762138	The likelihood of reporting sleep loss through worry is calculated at two time-points for 7785 respondents from the Health and Activity Survey (HALs) and 21,834 respondents from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), with baseline information on sleep loss through worry.
19762138	Descriptive statistical methods were applied to determine the prevalence rates in sleep loss through worry at each survey within both datasets.
27754926	We categorized measures of financial hardship into: material conditions (eg, out-of-pocket costs, productivity loss, medical debt, or bankruptcy), psychological responses (eg, distress or worry), and coping behaviors (eg, skipped medications).
27754926	Our findings highlight the need for consistent use of definitions, terms, and measures to determine the best intervention targets and inform intervention development in order to prevent and minimize the impact of financial hardship experienced by cancer survivors.
25140524	However, based on cognitive avoidance theories of worry in generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and rumination after post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), others have suggested that rumination may serve to avoid painful aspects of the loss, thereby contributing to complicated grief.
25140524	High ruminators were expected to show initial vigilance followed by subsequent disengagement for loss stimuli (i.e., picture deceased with a loss word) in the first 1500 ms. Additionally, we expected high ruminators to avoid these loss stimuli and to show attentional preference for non-loss-related negative stimuli (i.e., picture stranger with a negative word) on longer exposure durations (1500-10000 ms).
25140524	Contrary to expectations, we found no evidence for an effect of rumination on vigilance and disengagement of loss stimuli in the first 1500 ms.
25140524	However, in the 1500-10000 ms interval, high ruminators showed shorter gaze times for loss stimuli and longer gaze times for negative (and neutral) non-loss-related stimuli, even when controlling for depression and complicated grief symptom levels.
26307047	METHODS: In a descriptive cross sectional study, we used General Health Questionnaire to assess psychological distress and Oslo Social Support Scale to assess social support among 117 participants who survived EVD, listed as EVD contacts or their relatives at Ebola Emergency Operation Center in Lagos, Nigeria.
26307047	Most frequently occurring psychological distress were inability to concentrate (37.6%) and loss of sleep over worry (33.3%).
26307047	Development of psychological distress could be predicted by loss of family member.
29654021	Worry about vision loss (OR=1.72, P<0.001), awareness of the importance of regular eye examination (OR=1.83, P=0.002) and awareness of the frequency of eye examinations ('every year' (OR=2.64, P<0.001) or 'every 6 months' (OR=3.27, P<0.001)) were the most significant factors associated with attendance.
25239281	Other important issues were emotional health (34%), physical health (11%), cognitive health (3%), and feelings of loss (9%; feelings of loss related to changes in the future/potential of the care recipient or related to the caregiver).
25239281	Areas of concern that were discussed that were specific to the caregiver and not fully evaluated by existing patient-reported outcomes (PROs) included feelings of loss, anxiety related to the caregiver role (reinjury concerns, worry about leaving the person alone, etc), and caregiver strain (burden, stress, feeling overwhelmed, etc).
29361912	In this study, we explore the prevalence and population distribution of general cancer worry and worries about specific aspects of cancer previously identified.
29361912	In terms of specific worries, two thirds would be 'quite a bit' or 'extremely' worried about the threat to life and emotional upset a diagnosis would cause.
29361912	Half would worry about surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and loss of control over life.
29361912	Worries about the social consequences were less commonly anticipated: just under half would worry about financial problems or their social roles, and a quarter would be worried about effects on identity, important relationships, gender role, and sexuality.
29361912	Women and younger people reported more frequent worry about getting cancer, and would be more worried about the emotional, physical, and social consequences of a cancer diagnosis (p < .001).
29361912	Those from ethnic minority backgrounds reported less frequent worry about getting cancer than their white counterparts, but would be equally worried about the emotional and physical impact of a cancer diagnosis, and worried more about the social consequences of a cancer diagnosis (p < .05).
29361912	CONCLUSIONS: The majority of English adults worry at least occasionally about getting cancer, and would be most worried about the emotional and physical impact of a cancer diagnosis.
26594267	Thematic content analysis revealed four categories that contained thirteen themes: (a) negative emotions of loneliness, which included themes of sadness, disconnection, fear, anger, and worry; (b) positive emotions when not lonely, which included themes of joy with others and pride in self; (c) loss of independence and loneliness, which included themes of functional decline contributes to loneliness, burden, and gratitude for help; and (d) ways of managing loneliness, which included remembering holidays and happier moments, staying busy, and getting out.
26594267	The study contributes new knowledge about the experience of anger, fear, and worry when lonely.
26594267	Future studies exploring the links between loneliness and anger, fear, worry, and negative physical health outcomes could enhance knowledge of mechanisms by which loneliness contributes to health decline.
26594267	Additionally, knowing that positive emotions such as joy are described as being linked to less lonely times could inform future work that aims to diminish loneliness and enhance positive emotional states.
30427918	This study aims to evaluate the validity of the Arabic version of the DT in Saudi cancer patients, to define the optimal cutoff point of the Arabic DT for detecting clinically significant distress and to determine whether there is any correlation between clinically significant distress and other demographic and Problem List variables.
30427918	In contrast, a multivariate regression analysis confirmed only advanced cancer stages, treatment decision, depression, fear, sadness, worry, breathing, feeling swollen, fever, indigestion, memory and concentration, dry nose and congestion, pain and sleep as independent factors associated with distress in cancer patients.
15132072	In this exploratory study, family members of 63 decedents were interviewed by telephone, two to five months post-death, about their perceptions of their loved one's worries, symptoms, and suffering at the end of life.
15132072	The most common worries reported focused on loss of bodily function (44%), being dependent (40%), and being a burden (39%).
15132072	A majority (94%) of family members reported that their loved one suffered at the end of life, but only worries about loss of quality of life (e.g., being unable to participate in enjoyable activities) were predictive of reports of suffering.
15132072	Findings suggest that worries, irrespective of the level of current symptoms, play an important role in the suffering of dying patients, and that treatment plans for the terminally ill should routinely explore both symptoms and worries.
24854574	The gradual loss of vision due to retinal diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), or glaucoma can contribute to the experience of negative psychosocial states, such as anxiety, stress, and depression, as well as diminished quality of life.
24854574	We hypothesize that VF testing elicits test performance anxiety and perception of functional losses of vision, which induces distracting negative thoughts that result in increased VF test variability.
24854574	We present a theoretical model to support the hypothesis that VF variability is linked to patients' negative thoughts during VF testing.
23089242	The severity of symptoms and the presence of nonmotor symptoms, especially cognitive decline, predict caregivers who are at greatest risk of prolonged grief; however it should be kept in mind that motor symptoms also contribute.
20384499	The 10 most common symptoms were pain (76%), weight loss (70%), itching (67%), feeling drowsy/tired (61%), and lack of energy (61%), numbness /tingling in hands or feet (57%), cough (53%) skin changes (52%), worry (51%), and lack of appetite (49%).
18427866	The present study evaluated whether different patterns of temperament may predict a different threshold of acceptability of obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms in adolescents.
18427866	Our data suggest that people characterized by pessimistic worry in anticipation of future problems, passive avoidant behaviour, rapid fatigability (high HA) and irresoluteness, ambitiousness, perseverance, perfectionism, enduring feelings of frustration (high P) might develop OC symptoms.
18427866	Whether OC symptoms become ego-syntonic or ego-dystonic seems to mainly depend on NS levels: low NS might protect people (with the prevention of exploratory and active behaviours that may elicit loss of control on symptoms) from the development of interfering OC symptoms.
21638116	Adolescents tend to experience more problems with sleep loss as a natural consequence of puberty, whereas teens from impoverished urban areas are likely to witness neighborhood violence and/or engage in risk behaviors that may affect sleep.
25547338	Most common reasons for missed meals included loss of appetite and feelings of fatigue or worry.
28843136	At baseline the following associations were significant: BMI, ED psychopathology, and self-esteem were associated with weight-related self-esteem; gender, BMI, and self-esteem were associated with weight-related public distress (i.e., stigma and worry in public because of one's weight); and age, BMI, and ED psychopathology were associated with weight-related physical function.
28843136	At end of treatment, the following associations were significant: changes in ED psychopathology and coping predicted weight-related self-esteem; changes in coping and self-esteem predicted weight-related public distress; and changes in BMI and subjective binge eating predicted weight-related physical function.
