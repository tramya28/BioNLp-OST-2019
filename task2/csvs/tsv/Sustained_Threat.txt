Sustained_Threat
15294391	This study investigated whether attentional processes contribute to fear-potentiated startle.
15837118	"The extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway has a key role in cell survival and brain plasticity, processes that are impaired following exposure to stressful situations."
15837118	"We have recently validated two repeated intermittent stress procedures in male NMRI mice, social threat and repeated exposure to a novel cage, which result in clear behavioral effects following 4 weeks of application."
17554005	The goal of this study was to compare cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes associated with phasic cued fear versus those associated with sustained contextual anxiety.
17554005	This study showed distinct neuronal networks involved in cued fear and contextual anxiety underlying the importance of this distinction for studies on the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders.
17582673	Results may have implications for understanding automatic and voluntary attentional biases related to anxiety.
17582673	"To examine this hypothesis, attention performance was measured in three domains--alerting, orienting, and executive attention."
17683209	A parallel line of research has determined that threatening stimuli more readily capture attention.
17683209	These findings indicate that the meaning of threat can be conveyed rapidly with minimal stimulus detail.
18472088	"However, under conditions of sustained environmental threat this otherwise-present attention bias disappears."
18472088	Anxious individuals show an attention bias towards threatening information.
19693004	"In rats, sustained fear is more sensitive to anxiolytic drugs."
19693004	"Thus, anxiety is a more long-lasting state of apprehension (sustained fear)."
20727909	The prevalent view is that the larger the animal groups the lower the individual vigilance.
20727909	"Vigilance is a reflection of anxiety, and here we show that anxiety is contagious in grouped social animals."
20883506	"However, direct evidence is still missing."
20883506	The threat detection advantage was replicated in the behavioral results.
21075229	"In this study, we investigated the brain mechanism involved in this process."
21075229	INTRODUCTION: Reducing fear when a threat has disappeared protects against a continuously elevated anxiety state.
21111828	Research in rodents suggests that anatomically related but distinct neural circuits may mediate phasic and sustained fear.
21111828	Aversive events are typically more debilitating when they occur unpredictably than predictably.
21242990	"In this study, we used a prospective design to investigate the consequences of severe stress in soldiers before and after deployment to a combat zone."
21242990	We found that combat stress increased amygdala and insula reactivity to biologically salient stimuli across the group of combat-exposed individuals.
21440905	Participants showed fear-potentiated startle to the threat cue in the P condition.
21440905	Short-duration cues were presented several times in each condition.
21666261	We examined whether amygdala responses to rapidly presented fear expressions are preferentially tuned to averted vs direct gaze fear and conversely whether responses to more sustained presentations are preferentially tuned to direct vs averted gaze fear.
21666261	"Together, these studies provide evidence consistent with an early, reflexive amygdala response tuned to clear threat and a later reflective response tuned to ambiguous threat."
22250290	"Furthermore, ventromedial prefrontal recruitment was lower in individuals with higher scores on intolerance of uncertainty measures, and this hyporecruitment predicted greater transient amygdala responding to potential threat cues."
22250290	States of lesser anxiety were associated with greater sustained activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.
22390706	"SAD patients showed a sustained threat bias, though it was smaller than in healthy controls."
22390706	An extensive body of research has demonstrated that anxious individuals abnormally process threat-related content.
22913418	"The threat cues elicited increased electrodermal activity and a sustained decrease in heart rate, consistent with defensive vigilance."
22913418	These effects were not explained by changes in latency.
24095880	"Subsequently, subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while completing the avoidance task."
24095880	Evidence from both nonhuman neurophysiological and human neuroimaging studies suggests a distributed frontal-limbic-striatal brain network supports avoidance.
24886788	We examined intrinsic functional connectivity.
25062842	Threatening stimuli have been shown to preferentially capture attention using a range of tasks and measures.
25062842	These results have implications for the study of attention to threat in both unselected and anxious populations.
25143607	"Together, our study unraveled a progression of responses and network-level changes due to sustained threat."
25143607	Entering a state of anxious anticipation triggers widespread changes across large-scale networks in the brain.
25761115	Fear-potentiated acoustic startle paradigms have been used to investigate phasic and sustained components of conditioned fear in rats and humans.
25761115	"An auditory Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm, with pseudo-randomized conditioned-unconditioned stimulus presentations at various durations, is combined with repetitive brief auditory white noise burst presentations during fear memory retrieval 24 h after fear conditioning."
26601909	This enhanced performance was paralleled by heightened activity of frontoparietal and frontostriatal circuitry.
26601909	Cognitive control performance was enhanced during the excited state relative to a nonarousing control condition.
26810702	Thirty participants performed a picture-viewing task in which cues indicated the subsequent picture valence.
26810702	Uncertainty appears to enhance the engagement of early phasic and sustained attention for uncertainly cued targets.
26829532	"Therefore, the current regional West Africa EVD requires strengthening healthcare systems and building preparedness and response capacity."
26829532	EVD has similar effects and burdens to HIV infection.
27369069	Anxiety can have both detrimental and facilitatory cognitive effects.
27369069	This study investigates the neural substrates of a replicated facilitatory effect of anxiety on sustained attention and response inhibition.
27698427	"Unpredictability, in turn, is considered an important variable contributing to anxiety disorders."
27698427	The brain circuits underlying behavioral fear have been extensively studied over the last decades.
28013055	Worry-relevant sustained attention towards negative emotional stimuli may be a partially mood-context dependent phenomenon.
28013055	Cognitive theories of anxiety psychopathology cite biased attention towards threat as a central vulnerability and maintaining factor.
28485259	BACKGROUND: Panic disorder (PD) patients are constantly concerned about future panic attacks and exhibit general hypersensitivity to unpredictable threat.
28485259	Insula and PFC also showed sustained activation.
28555565	"Therefore, there is a critical need to understand the neural mechanisms mediating anxiety symptoms."
28555565	The IPS plays a key role in attention orienting and may contribute to the hypervigilance that is a common symptom of pathological anxiety.
28981839	Sustained anticipatory anxiety is central to Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).
28981839	"The results for the BNST activation hint towards its role in sustained threat responding, and contribute to a deeper understanding of pathological sustained anticipatory anxiety in GAD."
29980493	"In contrast, losartan reduced amygdala response to happy faces early on."
29980493	METHODS: Thirty healthy volunteers high in trait anxiety were randomly assigned to a single dose of losartan (50 mg) versus placebo before undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging.
30144498	Pervasive avoidance behaviour is a core feature of anxiety disorders.
30144498	"Furthermore, greater avoidance behaviour predicted larger differential skin conductance responses to threat versus safety cues during extinction."
30463809	The results confirm that tDCS of the rIFC attenuates sustained fear.
30463809	Post-hoc tests revealed a significant reduction in SCR during sustained fear in verum stimulated group.
30878610	Anticipation of potentially threatening social situations is a key process in social anxiety disorder (SAD).
30878610	The aversive condition induced increased anxiety in patients compared to HC.
30993690	With each new threat comes the call for rapid vaccine development.
30993690	"Together with a growing understanding of viral disease emergence, a range of vaccine strategies and international commitment to underpin development, vaccine intervention for new and emerging viruses may become a possibility."
