"Previous studies have shown that music is a powerful means to convey affective states, but it remains unclear whether and how social context shape the intensity and quality of emotions perceived in music."
"Using a within-subject design, we studied this question in two experimental settings, i.e."
when subjects were alone versus in company of others without direct social interaction or feedback.
Non-vocal musical excerpts of the emotional qualities happiness or sadness were rated on arousal and valence dimensions.
"We found evidence for an amplification of perceived emotion in the solitary listening condition, i.e."
"happy music was rated as happier and more arousing when nobody else was around and, in an analogous manner, sad music was perceived as sadder."
This difference might be explained by a shift of attention in the presence of others.
The observed interaction of perceived emotion and social context did not differ for stimuli of different cultural origin.
Individual affect-related performance zones (IAPZs) method utilizing Kamata et al.
"(J Sport Exerc Psychol 24:189-208, 2002) probabilistic model of determining the individual zone of optimal functioning was utilized as idiosyncratic affective patterns during golf performance."
"To do so, three male golfers of a varsity golf team were observed during three rounds of golf competition."
"The investigation implemented a multi-modal assessment approach in which the probabilistic relationship between affective states and both, performance process and performance outcome, measures were determined."
"More specifically, introspective (i.e., verbal reports) and objective (heart rate and respiration rate) measures of arousal were incorporated to examine the relationships between arousal states and both, process components (i.e., routine consistency, timing), and outcome scores related to golf performance."
Results revealed distinguishable and idiosyncratic IAPZs associated with physiological and introspective measures for each golfer.
The associations between the IAPZs and decision-making or swing/stroke execution were strong and unique for each golfer.
"Results are elaborated using cognitive and affect-related concepts, and applications for practitioners are provided."
Cultures differ in the emotions they teach their members to value (ideal affect).
We conducted 3 studies to examine whether leaders' smiles reflect these cultural differences in ideal affect.
"In Study 1, we compared the smiles of top-ranked American and Chinese government leaders, chief executive officers, and university presidents in their official photos."
"Consistent with findings that Americans value excitement and other high-arousal positive states more than Chinese, American top-ranked leaders (N = 98) showed more excited smiles than Chinese top-ranked leaders (N = 91) across occupations."
"In Study 2, we compared the smiles of winning versus losing political candidates and higher versus lower ranking chief executive officers and university presidents in the United States and Taiwan/China."
"American leaders (N = 223) showed more excited smiles than Taiwanese/Chinese leaders (N = 266), regardless of election outcome or ranking."
"In Study 3, we administered self-report measures of ideal affect in college student samples from 10 different nations (N = 1,267) and then 8 years later, coded the smiles that legislators from those nations showed in their official photos (N = 3,372)."
"The more nations valued excitement and other high arousal positive states, the more their leaders showed excited smiles; similarly, the more nations valued calm and other low-arousal positive states, the more their leaders showed calm smiles."
"These results held after controlling for national differences in democratization, human development, and gross domestic product per capita."
"Together, these findings suggest that leaders' smiles reflect the affective states valued by their cultures."
BACKGROUND: Embodied models of social cognition argue that others' affective states are processed by re-enacting a sensory-specific representation of the same state in the observer.
"However, neuroimaging studies suggest that a reliable part of the representation shared between self and others is supramodal and relates to dimensions such as Unpleasantness or arousal, common to qualitatively different experiences."
"Here we investigated whether representations of first-hand pain and disgust influenced the subsequent evaluation of facial expressions in Modality-specific fashion, or in terms of Unpleasantness or arousal."
"METHODS: Thirty volunteers were subjected to thermal painful and olfactory disgusting events, and subsequently were asked to classify computer-generated faces expressing pain (characterized by high Unpleasantness and arousal), disgust (high Unpleasantness and low arousal), surprise (low Unpleasantness and high arousal) and hybrid combinations thereof."
RESULTS: Thermal and olfactory events were associated with comparable Unpleasantness ratings and heart rate (but stronger galvanic response was found for painful temperatures).
"Furthermore, we found that the appraisal of facial expressions was biased by the prior stimulus, with more frequent pain classifications following thermal stimuli, and more frequent disgust classifications following olfactory stimuli."
"Critically, this modulation was cross-modal in nature, as each first-hand stimulation influenced in comparable fashion facial traits diagnostic of both pain and disgust, without instead generalizing to features of surprise."
"CONCLUSION: Overall, these data support the presence of shared coding between one's aversive experiences and the appraisal of others' facial responses, which is best describable as supramodal representation of the Unpleasantness of the experience."
SIGNIFICANCE: These results extend previous findings about common representational coding between the experience of first-hand and others' pain.
"In particular, they highlight that reliable part of the information shared is supramodal in nature and relates to a broad dimension of Unpleasantness common also to painless aversive states such as disgust."
Positive and negative affects high in motivational intensity cause a narrowing of attentional focus.
"In contrast, positive affects low in motivational intensity cause a broadening of attentional focus."
The attentional consequences of negative affects low in motivational intensity have not been experimentally investigated.
Experiment 1 compared the attentional consequences of negative affect low in motivational intensity (sadness) relative to a neutral affective state.
Results indicated that low-motivation negative affect caused attentional broadening.
"Experiment 2 found that disgust, a high-motivation negative affect not previously investigated in attentional studies, narrowed attentional focus."
These experiments support the conceptual model linking high-motivation affective states to narrowed attention and low-motivation affective states to broadened attention.
The aim of the current study was to investigate if startle methodology is suitable to reflect urinary urgency.
"Eighteen healthy men were tested on two separate days, each including an ingestion of fluid until 80% of the subjective urge to micturate was reached."
"EMG responses to acoustic startle stimuli were assessed before and after micturition, as well as in the early and late cardiac cycle phases (230 vs. 530ms after a cardiac R-wave)."
Sonographic assessment confirmed bladder-filling status.
"Emotional arousal, stress, urge and unpleasantness ratings, as well as mean blood pressure were higher before than after micturition."
"Startle eye blink responses were lower during the early than during the late cardiac cycle phase, but were not affected by bladder filling status."
"We conclude that startle methodology is suitable for the investigation of afferent signals from the cardiovascular system, but not to reflect urinary urgency."
This result may be due to different neurophysiological mechanisms underlying afferent signals from the bladder compared to other visceral organs or interference with affective states or sympathetic activation associated with bladder filling.
"Notwithstanding, the present research protocol of fluid intake, sonographic assessment of the bladder, and subjective reports, can be applied to examine effects of urinary urge on physiological and psychological processes."
BACKGROUND: The complex concordance and discordance across and within anxiety and depressive symptoms complicates understanding of the relation between emotional symptoms and manifestations of tobacco withdrawal.
The goal of this study was to parse the broad variation in anxiety and depressive symptoms into conceptually discrete components and explore their relative predictive influence on affective patterns of acute tobacco withdrawal.
METHODS: We employed a within-participant experimentally manipulated tobacco abstinence design involving: (i) a baseline visit at which past-week depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed and (ii) two counterbalanced experimental visits-one after ad lib smoking and one after 16-h of tobacco abstinence-at which state affect was assessed.
Participants were community-dwelling adults (N=187) smoking 10+ cig/day for at least two years without an active mood disorder.
"RESULTS: Anxiety-related general distress symptoms (e.g., tension, nervousness) predicted greater abstinence-induced increases in various negative affective states but not changes in positive affect (betas .17-.33)."
"Depression-related general distress symptoms (e.g., sadness, worthlessness) predicted greater abstinence-induced increases in acute depressed affect only (betas .24-.25)."
"Anhedonic symptoms (e.g., diminished interest, lack of pleasure) predicted larger abstinence-induced decreases in acute positive affect only (betas .17-.20)."
"Anxious Arousal symptoms (e.g., shakiness, heart racing) predicted larger abstinence-induced increases in fatigue and depressive affect (betas .15-.24)."
CONCLUSION: Different components of anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with unique affective patterns of acute tobacco withdrawal.
These results provide insight into the affective mechanisms underlying tobacco dependence and could inform smoking cessation treatment approaches tailored to individuals with emotional distress.
"Many people accept the idea that time seems to pass more quickly as they get older, as if this is a psychological reality."
"However, systematic investigations of differences in judgments of passage of time between young and elderly people are very rare and contradictory."
"The present study examined the experience of passage of time in daily life in young and elderly people using Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM), with 8 alerts per day for 5 days being delivered by smartphones."
"At each alert, a short questionnaire was filled in, asking questions about passage of present time, affective state, arousal level, and attention to current activities, among others."
Our ESM study found no difference between the young and the old participants in the judgment of passage of present time.
"Irrespective of the participants' age, the experience of passage of time in every-day life was significantly related to affective states and current activities when they captured attention."
"Previous findings indirectly suggest that the more people perceive their time in life as limited, the more they value calm."
"No study, however, has directly tested this hypothesis."
"To this end, using a combination of survey, experience sampling, and experimental methods, we examined the relationship between future time perspective and the affective states that people ideally want to feel (i.e., their ideal affect)."
"In Study 1, the more people reported a limited time perspective, the more they wanted to feel calm and experience other low-arousal positive states."
"In Study 2, participants were randomly assigned to a limited time or an expanded time condition."
Participants in the limited time condition reported valuing calm and other low arousal positive states more than those in the expanded time condition.
"We discuss the implications of these findings for broadening our understanding of the factors that shape how people ideally want to feel, and their consequences for decision making."
"Neuroimaging findings are often interpreted in terms of affective experience, but researchers disagree about the advisability or even possibility of such inferences, and few frameworks explicitly link these levels of analysis."
"Here, we suggest that the spatial and temporal resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data could support inferences about affective states."
"Specifically, we propose that fMRI nucleus accumbens (NAcc) activity is associated with positive arousal, whereas a combination of anterior insula activity and NAcc activity is associated with negative arousal."
"This framework implies quantifiable and testable inferences about affect from fMRI data, which may ultimately inform predictions about approach and avoidance behavior."
We consider potential limits on neurally inferred affect before highlighting theoretical and practical benefits.
Few studies have investigated how attentional control is affected by transient affective states while taking individual differences in affective traits into consideration.
"In this study, participants completed a color-word Stroop task immediately after undergoing a positive, neutral or negative affective context manipulation (ACM)."
Behavioral performance was unaffected by any ACM considered in isolation.
"For individuals high in trait negative affect (NA), performance was impaired by the negative but not the positive or neutral ACM."
Neuroimaging results indicate that activity in primarily top-down control regions of the brain (inferior frontal gyrus and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) was suppressed in the presence of emotional arousal (both negative and positive ACMs).
"This effect appears to have been exacerbated or offset by co-occurring activity in other top-down control regions (parietal) and emotion processing regions (orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala and nucleus accumbens) as a function of the valence of state affect (positive or negative) and trait affect (trait NA or trait PA)."
Neuroimaging results are consistent with behavioral findings.
"In combination, they indicate both additive and interactive influences of trait and state affect on top-down control of attention."
"The Affective Norms for Polish Short Texts (ANPST) dataset (Imbir, 2016d) is a list of 718 affective sentence stimuli with known affective properties with respect to subjectively perceived valence, arousal, dominance, origin, subjective significance, and source."
This article examines the reliability of the ANPST and the impact of population type and sex on affective ratings.
The ANPST dataset was introduced to provide a recognized method of eliciting affective states with linguistic stimuli more complex than single words and that included contextual information and thus are less ambiguous in interpretation than single word.
Analysis of the properties of the ANPST dataset showed that norms collected are reliable in terms of split-half estimation and that the distributions of ratings are similar to those obtained in other affective norms studies.
The pattern of correlations was the same as that found in analysis of an affective norms dataset for words based on the same six variables.
"Female psychology students' valence ratings were also more polarized than those of their female student peers studying other subjects, but arousal ratings were only higher for negative words."
Differences also appeared for all other measured dimensions.
"Women's valence ratings were found to be more polarized and arousal ratings were higher than those made by men, and differences were also present for dominance, origin, and subjective significance."
The ANPST is the first Polish language list of sentence stimuli and could easily be adapted for other languages and cultures.
Two experiments examined how affective values from visual and auditory modalities are integrated.
Experiment 1 paired music and videos drawn from three levels of valence while holding arousal constant.
Experiment 2 included a parallel combination of three levels of arousal while holding valence constant.
"In each experiment, participants rated their affective states after unimodal and multimodal presentations."
Experiment 1 revealed a congruency effect in which stimulus combinations of the same extreme valence resulted in more extreme state ratings than component stimuli presented in isolation.
An interaction between music and video valence reflected the greater influence of negative affect.
Video valence was found to have a significantly greater effect on combined ratings than music valence.
The pattern of data was explained by a five parameter differential weight averaging model that attributed greater weight to the visual modality and increased weight with decreasing values of valence.
Experiment 2 revealed a congruency effect only for high arousal combinations and no interaction effects.
This pattern was explained by a three parameter constant weight averaging model with greater weight for the auditory modality and a very low arousal value for the initial state.
These results demonstrate key differences in audiovisual integration between valence and arousal.
Embodied theories of emotion assume that emotional processing is grounded in bodily and affective processes.
"Accordingly, the perception of an emotion re-enacts congruent sensory and affective states; and conversely, bodily states congruent with a specific emotion facilitate emotional processing."
"This study tests whether the ability to process facial expressions (faces having a neutral expression, expressing fear, or disgust) can be influenced by making the participants' body state congruent with the expressed emotion (e.g., high heart rate in the case of faces expressing fear)."
"We designed a task requiring participants to categorize pictures of male and female faces that either had a neutral expression (neutral), or expressed emotions whose linkage with high heart rate is strong (fear) or significantly weaker or absent (disgust)."
"Critically, participants were tested in two conditions: with experimentally induced high heart rate (Exercise) and with normal heart rate (Normal)."
Participants processed fearful faces (but not disgusted or neutral faces) faster when they were in the Exercise condition than in the Normal condition.
These results support the idea that an emotionally congruent body state facilitates the automatic processing of emotionally-charged stimuli and this effect is emotion-specific rather than due to generic factors such as arousal.
Psychophysiological research on emotion utilizes various physiological response measures to index activation of the defense system.
"Here we tested 1) whether acoustic startle reflex (ASR), skin conductance response (SCR) and heart rate (HR) elicited by highly arousing stimuli specifically reflect a defensive state and 2) the relation between resting heart rate variability (HRV) and affective responding."
"In a within-subject design, participants viewed film clips with a positive, negative and neutral content."
"In contrast to SCR and HR, we show that ASR differentiated between negative, neutral and positive states and can therefore be considered as a reliable index of activation of the defense system."
"Furthermore, resting HRV was associated with affect-modulated characteristics of ASR, but not with SCR or HR."
"Interestingly, individuals with low-HRV showed less differentiation in ASR between affective states."
We discuss the important value of ASR in psychophysiological research on emotion and speculate on HRV as a potential biological marker for demarcating adaptive from maladaptive responding.
The respiratory behavior during affective states is not completely understood.
We studied breathing pattern responses to picture series in 37 participants.
We also measured end-tidal pCO2 (EtCO2) to determine if ventilation is in balance with metabolic demands and spontaneous eye-blinking to investigate the link between respiration and attention.
Minute ventilation (MV) and inspiratory drive increased with self-rated arousal.
These relationships reflected increases in inspiratory volume rather than shortening of the time parameters.
EtCO2 covaried with pleasantness but not arousal.
Eye-blink rate decreased with increasing unpleasantness in line with a negativity bias in attention.
This study confirms that respiratory responses to affective stimuli are organized to a certain degree along the dimensions of valence and arousal.
"It shows, for the first time, that during picture viewing, ventilatory increases with increasing arousal are in balance with metabolic activity and that inspiratory volume is modulated by arousal."
MV emerges as the most reliable respiratory index of self-perceived arousal.
"Hypothesizing that genetic factors partially govern sensitivity to interpersonal cues, we examined whether a polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) in the serotonin transporter gene would moderate spouses' sensitivity to positive and negative partner affect."
"Before and after marital discussions, participants from 76 couples (total n = 150) reported their affective states."
"Spouses carrying the short allele of the 5-HTTLPR were more responsive to their partner's preinteraction positive affect and anxiety/nervousness, compared with spouses with two long alleles."
These data support the contention that the serotonin system influences affective responses to social stimuli.
"In contrast to the view that the 5-HTTLPR primarily affects response to adverse experiences, these results suggest that this polymorphism moderates sensitivity to positive as well as negative affect."
The neural correlates of human emotions are easy to harvest.
"In contrast, the neural constitution of emotional feelings in humans has resisted systematic scientific analysis."
This review summarizes how preclinical affective neuroscience initiatives are making progress in decoding the neural nature of such feelings in animal brains.
"This has been achieved by studying the rewarding and punishing effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of subcortical emotional networks (labeled SEEING, RAGE, FEAR, LUST, CARE, PANIC, and PLAY systems) that evoke distinct emotion action patterns, as well as rewarding and punishing effects in animals."
"The implications of this knowledge for development of new psychiatric interventions, especially depression, are discussed."
"Three new antidepressive therapeutics arising from this work are briefly noted: 1) DBS of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) in humans, 2) reduction of psychological pain that may arise from excessive PANIC arousal, and 3) facilitation of social joy through the study of social play in rats The overall argument is that we may more readily develop new psychiatric interventions through preclinical models if we take animal emotional feelings seriously, as opposed to just behavioral changes, as targets for development of new treatments."
Positive affect has been related to faster cardiovascular recovery from stress.
"Although the family of positive affective states is diverse, no study examined whether high-approach positive affect (e.g., desire) has a different impact on peripheral physiological processes than more frequently studied low-approach positive affect (e.g., amusement)."
"Building upon prior work on emotions and motivation, we expected that after controlling for arousal and valence, positive affect with higher motivational intensity would facilitate weaker recovery when compared to positive affect with lower motivational intensity."
"Across two experiments (N=179 for Study 1, N=220 for Study 2), we measured cardiovascular, respiratory, and electrodermal responses to positive stimuli that differed in approach intensity."
We measured responses during recovery from stress and during reactivity to threat and anger.
"These studies partially replicated previous findings regarding the soothing function of positive affect (e.g., in respect to diastolic blood pressure recovery and reactivity)."
"However, we found that high-approach and low-approach positive affect produced comparable effects."
"In summary, these findings suggest that positive valence rather than motivational intensity produces the main soothing effect on peripheral physiology."
"Prior research has indicated that ideal affect (i.e., the affective states that people value and would ideally like to experience) may be relevant to mental health outcomes."
"Studies to date, however, have not used comprehensive multivariate models that account for covariation among facets of ideal affect and incorporate multiple clinical outcomes."
"In the present studies, we used structural equation modeling to examine the multivariate effects of ideal affect on symptoms of depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse in 2 moderately large samples of undergraduates (N = 293 and N = 146)."
Exploratory results of Study 1 indicated that valuation of high arousal positive affective states was significantly associated with lower depression symptoms but higher anxiety and alcohol abuse symptoms and that valuation of high arousal negative states was specifically associated with greater anxiety symptoms.
"These results were shown to be structurally invariant across samples and ethnicities in Study 2, which also found that ideal-actual affect discrepancies were significantly associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety."
These findings support and extend the hypothesis that ideal affect is implicated in clinical outcomes by highlighting the importance of jointly considering multiple facets of ideal and actual affect as they relate to a range of clinical syndromes.

"Due to their direct inaccessibility, affective states are classically assessed by gathering concomitant physiological and behavioral measures."
"Although such a dual approach to assess emotional states is frequently used in different species including humans, the invasiveness of procedures for physiological recordings particularly in smaller-sized animals strongly restricts their application."
"We used infrared thermography, a non-invasive method, to assess physiological arousal during open field and elevated plus maze tests in mice."
"By measuring changes in surface temperature indicative of the animals' emotional response, we aimed to improve the inherently limited and still controversial information provided by behavioral parameters commonly used in these tests."
"Our results showed significant and consistent thermal responses during both tests, in accordance with classical physiological responses occurring in stressful situations."
"Besides, we found correlations between these thermal responses and the occurrence of anxiety-related behaviors."
"Furthermore, initial temperatures measured at the start of each procedure (open field, elevated plus maze), which can be interpreted as a measure of the animals' initial physiological arousal, predicted the levels of activity and of anxiety-related behaviors displayed during the tests."
Our results stress the strong link between physiological correlates of emotions and behaviors expressed during unconditioned fear tests.
"Affective states underlie daily decision-making and pathological behaviours relevant to obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD), mood disorders and addictions."
"Deep brain stimulation targeting the motor and associative-limbic subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been shown to be effective for Parkinson's disease (PD) and OCD, respectively."
"Cognitive and electrophysiological studies in PD showed responses of the motor STN to emotional stimuli, impairments in recognition of negative affective states and modulation of the intensity of subjective emotion."
Here we studied whether the stimulation of the associative-limbic STN in OCD influences the subjective emotion to low-intensity positive and negative images and how this relates to clinical symptoms.
We assessed 10 OCD patients with on and off STN DBS in a double-blind randomized manner by recording ratings of valence and arousal to low- and high-intensity positive and negative emotional images.
"STN stimulation increased positive ratings and decreased negative ratings to low-intensity positive and negative stimuli, respectively, relative to off stimulation."
We also show that the change in severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms pre- versus post-operatively interacts with both DBS and valence ratings.
We show that stimulation of the associative-limbic STN might influence the negative cognitive bias in OCD and decreasing the negative appraisal of emotional stimuli with a possible relationship with clinical outcomes.
That the effect is specific to low intensity might suggest a role of uncertainty or conflict related to competing interpretations of image intensity.
These findings may have implications for the therapeutic efficacy of DBS.
"Producing and perceiving music engage a wide range of sensorimotor, cognitive, and emotional processes."
"Emotions are a central feature of the enjoyment of music, with a large variety of affective states consistently reported by people while listening to music."
"However, besides joy or sadness, music often elicits feelings of wonder, nostalgia, or tenderness, which do not correspond to emotion categories typically studied in neuroscience and whose neural substrates remain largely unknown."
Here we review the similarities and differences in the neural substrates underlying these complex music-evoked emotions relative to other more basic emotional experiences.
"We suggest that these emotions emerge through a combination of activation in emotional and motivational brain systems (e.g., including reward pathways) that confer its valence to music, with activation in several other areas outside emotional systems, including motor, attention, or memory-related regions."
We then discuss the neural substrates underlying the entrainment of cognitive and motor processes by music and their relation to affective experience.
"These effects have important implications for the potential therapeutic use of music in neurological or psychiatric diseases, particularly those associated with motor, attention, or affective disturbances."
In this article we propose a psychobiological model that construes PTSD fundamentally as a disorder of affect arousal regulation.
Neuroimaging studies of emotion regulation in psychologically healthy populations are initially reviewed as a framework for interpreting the results of previously published investigations of the neural correlates of PTSD reexperiencing and dissociation.
We then apply the emotion regulation framework toward understanding other perturbed affective states in PTSD.
We conclude by discussing the clinical significance of this framework for psychological assessment and treatment of posttrauma psychopathology.
The present work investigated the effects of participant emotional state on global versus local memory for map-based information.
"Participants were placed into one of four emotion induction groups, crossing high and low arousal with positive and negative valence, or a control group."
"They then studied a university campus map and completed two memory tests, free recall and spatial statement verification."
"Converging evidence from these two tasks demonstrated that arousal amplifies symbolic distance effects and leads to a globally-focused spatial mental representation, partially at the expense of local knowledge."
These results were found for both positively- and negatively-valenced affective states.
"The present study is the first investigation of emotional effects on spatial memory, and has implications for theories of emotion and spatial cognition."
Emotional empathy-feeling another person's affective states-entails simulating how one would feel in the same circumstance.
Prior research has implicated the role of executive controls and shown a link between visuospatial perspective taking and personal disposition of empathy.
No study has investigated how executive control processes involved in perspective shifting relate to emotional empathy.
"Incorporating a spatial perspective-taking task in a set switch paradigm, we investigated whether swiftly switching from the altercentric to the egocentric perspective is associated with heightened emotional empathy but not with accurate classification of low-level perceptual affective cues."
Emotional empathy was measured by subjective ratings of arousal and the similarity of affective states with the target person when viewing photos of a person in an emotionally charged context.
Cognitive empathy was measured by correct recognition of affective cues.
Our results showed that executive controls in perspective shifting related to emotional empathy but not to cognitive empathy.
Emotional empathy correlated negatively with the switch cost from the altercentric to the egocentric perspective and not vice versa.
Faster switching from the altercentric to the egocentric perspective was associated with heightened emotional empathy.
"Moreover, the processing strategy did not moderate the association."
"Flexibility in perspective shifting, especially in regaining one's own perspective after taking another person's perspective, is critical for emotional empathy."
"To feel another person's affective states, one should regain self-perspective after walking in the other person's shoes."
