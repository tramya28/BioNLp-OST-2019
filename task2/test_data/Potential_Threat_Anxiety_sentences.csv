"Many Israelis are preoccupied with the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran, frequently associating it with the danger of annihilation that existed during the Holocaust."
"The current article examined whether offspring of Holocaust survivors (OHS) are especially preoccupied and sensitive to the Iranian threat, and whether this susceptibility is a part of their increased general image of actual and potential threats, defined as the hostile world scenario (HWS)."
"Study 1 (N = 106) showed that relative to comparisons, OHS reported more preoccupation with the Iranian nuclear threat."
"Moreover, the positive relationship between the salience of the Iranian threat and symptoms of anxiety was stronger among OHS."
"Study 2 (N = 450) replicated these findings, while focusing on the Iranian nuclear threat salience and symptoms of psychological distress."
"It further showed that OHS reported more negative engagement with the HWS (i.e., feeling that surrounding threats decrease one's sense of competence), which in turn mediated their increased preoccupation with the Iranian threat."
"The results suggest that intergenerational transmission of the Holocaust trauma includes heightened preoccupation with and sensitivity to potential threats of annihilation, and that the specific preoccupation with threats of annihilation reflects a part of a more general preoccupation with surrounding threats."
"BACKGROUND: Though a key symptom underlying many anxiety disorders is hypervigilant threat monitoring, its biological bases in humans remain poorly understood."
Animal models suggest that anxious processes such as hypervigilant threat monitoring are distinct from cued fear-like responses and mediated by the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST).
"Here, we applied psychophysiological and neuroimaging methodologies sensitive to sustained arousal-based responses to test the role of the human BNST in mediating environmental threat monitoring, a potential experimental model for sustained anxiety symptoms."
"METHODS: Healthy participants (n = 50) with varying trait anxiety performed an environmental threat-monitoring task during functional magnetic resonance imaging where a stimulus line continuously fluctuated in height, providing information relevant to subsequent risk for electric shocks."
Skin conductance was collected in a separate cohort (n = 47) to validate task-evoked modulation of physiological arousal.
RESULTS: A forebrain region consistent with the BNST showed greater overall recruitment and exaggerated tracking of threat proximity in individuals with greater anxiety.
"The insular cortex tracked threat proximity across all participants, showed exaggerated threat proximity responding with greater anxiety, and showed enhanced recruitment when threat proximity was ostensibly controllable."
CONCLUSIONS: Activity in the BNST and insula continuously monitored changes in environmental threat level and also subserved hypervigilant threat-monitoring processes in more highly trait anxious individuals.
These findings bridge human and animal research informing the role of the BNST in anxious-related processes.
"In addition, these findings suggest that continuous functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigms offer promise in further elucidating the neural circuitries supporting sustained anticipatory features of anxiety."
This study investigated modifications to standing posture in response to elevated postural anxiety evoked by a potential physical threat to stability.
"Sixteen young adults, 16 older adults and 16 patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) stood with or without the expectation of a threat to their posture (i.e., external trunk perturbation)."
This method allowed for the assessment of the effects of anticipatory anxiety on standing posture associated with an ecologically valid and direct threat to stability.
"Our manipulation was successful as all participants, independent of age and disease, reported significant increases in postural anxiety when anticipating a threat to their posture."
The trunk sway modifications observed in response to elevated postural anxiety were dependent on age and disease.
Young adults showed increased trunk sway in both pitch and roll directions while older adults demonstrated decreased trunk sway but only in the roll direction when standing and expecting a threat to posture compared to standing without this threat.
Individuals with PD showed no significant changes in trunk pitch or roll sway when anticipating a threat to posture compared to standing without this threat.
"Our findings suggest that the effects of postural anxiety on postural control are dependent on the context associated with the postural threat, and age and disease status."
"Challenge and threat states predict future performance; however, no research has examined their immediate effect on motor task performance."
The present study examined the effect of challenge and threat states on golf putting performance and several possible mechanisms.
"One hundred twenty-seven participants were assigned to a challenge or threat group and performed six putts during which emotions, gaze, putting kinematics, muscle activity, and performance were recorded."
Challenge and threat states were successively manipulated via task instructions.
"The challenge group performed more accurately, reported more favorable emotions, and displayed more effective gaze, putting kinematics, and muscle activity than the threat group."
"Multiple putting kinematic variables mediated the relationship between group and performance, suggesting that challenge and threat states impact performance at a predominately kinematic level."
Anxiety can have both detrimental and facilitatory cognitive effects.
This study investigates the neural substrates of a replicated facilitatory effect of anxiety on sustained attention and response inhibition.
This effect consisted of improved performance on the Sustained Attention to Response Task (a Go-NoGo task consisting of 91% Go and 9% NoGo trials) in threat (unpredictable electrical shock) vs safe (no shock) conditions.
This study uses the same experimental design with fMRI and relies on an event-related analysis of BOLD signal changes.
Findings reveal that threat-related cognitive facilitation (improved NoGo accuracy) is associated with greater activation of a right-lateralized frontoparietal group of regions previously implicated in sustained attention and response inhibition.
"Moreover, these same regions show decreased activation in the Go trials preceding NoGo errors."
"During NoGo trials, striatal activity is also greater in the threat vs safe condition, consistent with the notion of enhanced inhibitory processing under threat."
These findings identify potential mechanisms by which threat of unpredictable shock can facilitate distinct cognitive functions.
A greater understanding of the complex interaction of the anxious state and cognitive processes may have critical clinical implications.
Negative emotions such as anxiety enhance pain perception.
"However, certain threat characteristics are discussed to have different or even divergent effects on pain (hypoalgesia vs hyperalgesia)."
"In order to investigate the neurobiological basis of different threats, we compared the impact of conditioned threat (CT) vs instructed threat (IT) on pain using fMRI."
"In two groups, participants underwent either Pavlovian threat conditioning or an instructed threat procedure."
"Afterwards, in an identical test phase participants watched the same visual cues from the previous phase indicating potential threat or safety, and received painful thermal stimulation."
"In the test phase, pain ratings were increased in both groups under threat."
"Group comparisons show elevated responses in amygdala and hippocampus for pain under threat in the CT group, and higher activation of the mid-cingulate gyrus (MCC) in the IT group."
Psychophysiological interaction analyses in CT demonstrated elevated connectivity of the amygdala and the insula for the comparison of pain under threat vs safety.
"In IT, the same comparison revealed elevated functional connectivity of the MCC and the insula."
"The results suggest a similar pain augmenting effect of CT and IT, which, however, seems to rely on different networks mediating the impact of threat on pain."
"Behavioural pattern separation (BPS), the ability to distinguish among similar stimuli based on subtle physical differences, has been used to study the mechanism underlying stimulus generalisation."
Fear overgeneralisation is often observed in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder and other anxiety disorders.
"However, the relationship between anxiety and BPS remains unclear."
"The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of anxiety (threat of shock) on BPS, which was assessed across separate encoding and retrieval sessions."
Images were encoded/retrieved during blocks of threat or safety in a 2 x 2 factorial design.
"During retrieval, participants indicated whether images were new, old, or altered."
"Better accuracy was observed for altered images encoded during periods of threat compared to safety, but only if those images were also retrieved during periods of safety."
These results suggest that overgeneralisation in anxiety may be due to altered pattern separation.
The dot-probe task is often considered a gold standard in the field for investigating attentional bias to threat.
"However, serious issues with the task have been raised."
"Specifically, a number of studies have demonstrated that the traditional reaction time (RT) measure of attentional bias to threat in the dot-probe task has poor internal reliability and poor test-retest reliability."
"In addition, although threatening stimuli capture attention in other paradigms, attentional bias to threat has not usually been found in typical research participants in the dot-probe task."
"However, when attention is measured in the dot-probe task with the N2pc component of the event-related potential waveform, substantial attentional orienting to threat is observed, and the internal reliability is moderate."
"To provide a rigorous comparison of the reliability of this N2pc measure and the conventional behavioral measure, as well as to examine the relationship of these measures to anxiety, the present study examined the N2pc in conjunction with RT in the dot-probe task in a large sample of participants (N = 96)."
"As in previous studies, RT showed no bias to threatening images across the sample and exhibited poor internal reliability."
"Moreover, this measure did not relate to trait anxiety."
"By contrast, the N2pc revealed a significant initial shift of attention to threat, and this measure was internally reliable."
"However, the N2pc was not correlated with trait anxiety, indicating that it does not provide a meaningful index of individual differences in anxiety in the dot-probe task."
"Together, these results indicate a serious need to develop new tasks and methods to more reliably investigate attentional bias to threat and its relationship to anxiety in both clinical and non-clinical populations."
Considerable translational research on anxiety examines attention bias to threat and the efficacy of attention training in reducing symptoms.
Imaging research on the stability of brain functions engaged by attention bias tasks could inform such research.
Perturbed fronto-amygdala function consistently arises in attention bias research on adolescent anxiety.
The current report examines the stability of the activation and functional connectivity of these regions on the dot-probe task.
"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation and connectivity data were acquired with the dot-probe task in 39 healthy youth (f=18, Mean Age=13.71years, SD=2.31) at two time points, separated by approximately nine weeks."
Intraclass-correlations demonstrate good reliability in both neural activation for the ventrolateral PFC and task-specific connectivity for fronto-amygdala circuitry.
Behavioral measures showed generally poor test-retest reliability.
These findings suggest potential avenues for future brain imaging work by highlighting brain circuitry manifesting stable functioning on the dot-probe attention bias task.
BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that assessment of threat-related attention bias may be useful in identifying soldiers at risk for clinical symptoms.
The present study assessed the degree to which soldiers experienced combat events and showed attentional threat avoidance affected their reported levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety symptoms.
"METHODS: Four months after a combat deployment to Iraq, 63 US soldiers completed a survey assessing combat exposures and clinical symptoms as well as a dot-probe task assessing threat-related attention bias."
"RESULTS: Significant three-way interactions regressing threat reaction times (RTs), neutral RTs, and combat exposure on PTSD and anxiety symptoms were observed."
"Specifically, soldiers with high levels of combat exposure, who were more likely to demonstrate attentional bias away from threat, were also more symptomatic."
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the potential of threat-related attention bias as a behavioral marker of PTSD and anxiety symptoms in a high-risk military occupational context.
The present study examined the interaction of anticipatory anxiety and selective emotion processing.
"Toward this end, a rapid stream of pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant pictures was presented in alternating blocks of threat-of-shock or safety, which were signaled by colored picture frames."
The main finding is that pleasant pictures elicited a sustained negative difference potential over occipital regions during threat as compared to safety periods.
"In contrast, unpleasant and neutral picture processing did not vary as a function of threat-of-shock."
"Furthermore, in both the safety and threat-of-shock conditions, emotional pictures elicited an enlarged early posterior negativity and late positive potential."
These data show that the activation of the fear/anxiety network exerts valence-specific effects on affective picture processing.
Pleasant stimuli mismatching the current state of anticipatory anxiety apparently draw more attentional resources.
BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Current models of SAD assume that attentional processes play a pivotal role in the etiology and maintenance of social anxiety disorder.
Social anxiety is supposedly associated with an attentional bias towards disorder related stimuli such as threatening faces.
"Using the facial dot probe task in socially anxious individuals has, however, revealed inconsistent findings."
"METHODS: The current systematic review aims at disentangling the heterogeneous findings using effect sizes across results by systematically taking into account potential moderating variables (stimulus type, stimulus duration, situational anxiety, disorder severity)."
RESULTS: Results provide some evidence that socially anxious individuals preferentially allocate their attention towards threat faces compared to non-anxious controls.
"This bias seems to depend on the type of reference stimulus, stimulus duration and clinical level of social anxiety."
"Avoidance of threat was neither found at early, nor at later stages of attentional processing."
"LIMITATIONS: Importantly, the results have to be considered in the light of the only few studies available."
"Given the heterogeneity of results and some methodological restrictions of the studies included, the picture of attentional bias seems to be much less clear than suggested in the recent social anxiety literature."
"CONCLUSIONS: Methodologically, combined measures of dot-probe and eye movement measures might be beneficial to detect overt attentional biases."
"Importantly, our results show that preferential processing of threat cues might guide early attentional processes in social anxiety, depending however on several contextual and situational factors."
"Clinically, patients with greater severity of SAD may be more prone to such an attentional bias, thus therapists should take this into account when planning behavioral experiments and exposure therapy."
The current study is a review of existing literature on perceived threat across childhood (0-19 years).
"There is strong evidence from this body of research that threat detection emerges in infancy and is present throughout childhood, with meaningful links to child adjustment."
"The wide range of methodologies employed to assess threat include biological measures (event-related potential and functional magnetic resonance imaging), observational data (gaze duration and response time), and a range of ways of gathering cognitive data (threat appraisal)."
"Across methodologies, a uniform finding is that children who have higher threat attenuation are at increased risk for the development of anxiety disorders."
"It also seems that children's attention to threatening stimuli may vary across development, with heightened attention in infancy and early childhood."
These findings have meaningful extensions for children who are living in violent families.
"Since many children living in violent homes are exposed to the threat of violence beginning in infancy, these children may be at heightened risk as compared to their nonexposed peers for the development of maladaptive patterns of threat detection and response."
There is some evidence that this long-standing pattern of vigilance toward threat in key developmental periods may in part explain the increased risk of the development of anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder following exposure to violence.
Information processing models propose that anxious individuals are characterized by memory biases for mood-congruent threat information.
"However, evidence for memory biases in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has been mixed at best."
"Given the heterogeneity of concerns in GAD, previous use of nomothetic stimulus sets may have precluded detection of memory biases."
"Therefore, in order to guarantee the relevance of the stimuli used, in the current study individuals with GAD each individually selected words that were of personal relevance to them."
"Using these idiographically selected words with 23 individuals with DSM-IV GAD and 23 non-anxious controls (NACs), results showed an implicit memory bias for threat words in individuals with GAD compared with NACs."
"Furthermore, there was additional evidence that individuals with GAD may also be characterized by explicit memory bias for threat words."
The magnitude of group differences for explicit recall of threat words was similar to those previously observed in panic disorder.
Limitations and future directions are discussed.
Anxiety is reliably associated with an attentional bias favoring threatening information which is thought to be a key mechanism in the etiology and maintenance of anxious pathology.
"However, whether and how anxiety is related to attentional capture at a more basic level (i.e., in the absence of threat) is less well understood."
"To address this gap in the literature, we examined the association between anxiety and attentional capture in the context of visually salient, yet affectively neutral, stimuli."
"Specifically, we used a visual search task in which participants were required to locate a target while ignoring a salient distractor stimulus."
A total of 122 undergraduates-half of whom were assigned to a state-anxiety induction-completed this task while event-related potentials were recorded and also completed self-report measures of trait and state anxiety.
"The results revealed that trait anxiety, but not state anxiety, was associated with impaired attentional control in the presence of a salient distractor."
"That is, behavioral slowing and the N2pc event-related potential-a neural measure of attentional selection-were enhanced for trait-anxious participants when the distractor was proximate to the target and required controlled attention in order to inhibit it."
These findings extend previous work by providing evidence from multiple levels of analysis that attentional aberrations in anxiety reflect broad deficits in inhibiting distracting stimuli and are not limited to threat-relevant contexts.
Disproportionately more smokers report low-income and mental health problems relative to non-smokers.
Low-income smokers may use smoking to alleviate negative emotional states resulting from exposure to multiple stressors.
"Yet, little work has been devoted to elucidating mechanisms that may explain the association between negative emotional states and smoking-related processes among low-income smokers."
"The present study sought to address this gap by examining anxiety sensitivity, a transdiagnostic factor related to both anxiety and smoking, as a potential mediator for the influence of anxiety symptoms on smoking-related processes, including threat-related smoking abstinence expectancies (somatic symptoms and harmful consequences), perceived barriers for cessation, and problems experienced during past quit attempts."
Participants included treatment-seeking daily cigarette smokers (n=101; 68.3% male; Mage=47.1; SD=10.2).
"Results indicated that anxiety symptoms exerted a significant indirect effect through anxiety sensitivity for threat-related smoking abstinence expectancies (somatic symptoms and harmful consequences), perceived barriers for cessation, and problems experienced during past quit attempts."
The present results provide empirical support that anxiety sensitivity may be an underlying mechanism that partially explains the relation between anxiety symptoms and smoking processes among low-income treatment-seeking smokers.
Findings broaden current theoretical understanding of pathways through which anxiety symptoms contribute to maladaptive smoking processes and cognitions among socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers.
"Computer-based approaches, such as Attention Bias Modification (ABM), could help improve access to care for anxiety."
Study-level meta-analyses of ABM have produced conflicting findings and leave critical questions unresolved regarding ABM's mechanisms of action and clinical potential.
We pooled patient-level datasets from randomized controlled trials of children and adults with high-anxiety.
"Attentional bias (AB) towards threat, the target mechanism of ABM, was tested as an outcome and a mechanistic mediator and moderator of anxiety reduction."
Diagnostic remission and Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) were clinical outcomes available in enough studies to enable pooling.
Per-patient data were obtained on at least one outcome from 13/16 eligible studies [86% of eligible participants; n=778].
"Significant main effects of ABM on diagnostic remission (ABM-22.6%, control-10.8%; OR=2.57; p=0.006) and AB (beta* (95%CI)=-0.63 (-0.83, -0.42); p<0.00005) were observed."
There was no main effect of ABM on LSAS.
"However, moderator analyses suggested ABM was effective for patients who were younger (</=37y), trained in the lab, and/or assessed by clinicians."
"Under the same conditions where ABM was effective, mechanistic links between AB and anxiety reduction were supported."
"Under these specific circumstances, ABM reduces anxiety and acts through its target mechanism, supporting ABM's theoretical basis while simultaneously suggesting clinical indications and refinements to improve its currently limited clinical potential."
"Patterns of synchrony in repeated measures of heart rate, skin conductance levels, negative affect, and positive affect were investigated in patients with social anxiety disorder and non-anxious controls during a speech task."
"Despite expected low levels of absolute concordance between measures of affect and arousal overall, results revealed clearly defined and specific patterns of emotional response coherence that distinguished between the two groups and depended on the types of measures used."
"Specifically, findings demonstrated that (a) for both patients and controls, increased heart rate was significantly synchronized with increased negative affect, with patients showing overall stronger levels of synchrony between these two measures than controls; (b) for controls only, increased heart rate was significantly synchronized with increased positive affect; and (c) for patients only, increased skin conductance was significantly synchronized with both increased negative affect and decreased positive affect."
These findings are discussed in relation to current conceptualizations of the construct of emotion as well as directions for future research and potential implications for clinical practice.
"Emotional processes have an impact on the anticipation and perception of bodily threat sensations, such as breathlessness."
"However, little is known about the reverse influence of breathlessness on emotional processes, as well as its modulation by anxiety sensitivity (AS)."
"Here, we investigated by means of visually evoked potentials how the perception versus anticipation of resistive-load-induced breathlessness (RLIB) influences emotional processing."
"High (HA) and low anxious (LA) participants viewed pictures of positive, neutral, or negative content under conditions of perceived RLIB, anticipated RLIB, or an unloaded baseline."
The P2 (230-290 ms) was significantly less positive under perceived RLIB.
"Furthermore, the early late positive potential (LPP; 300-500 ms) was significantly less positive during both RLIB conditions, as compared to baseline."
"Overall, the P1 was significantly more positive in HA as compared to LA individuals."
"Additionally, across conditions, the late LPP (600-1,000 ms) was enhanced for positive and negative pictures as opposed to neutral ones for the LA group."
"In contrast, for the HA group only, the positive pictures elicited the typical enhanced LPP."
"Notably, for the HA participants, negative pictures elicited significantly blunted late LPPs during perceived RLIB as compared to anticipated RLIB and baseline."
"A reversed effect (i.e., more positivity) was observed for LA participants, suggesting motivational priming."
"Taken together, these results highlight the impact of perceived and anticipated respiratory threat on the neural processing of emotional picture stimuli, as well as its modulation by anxiety sensitivity levels."
Overgeneralization of fear to safety cues is increasingly being studied in order to further our understanding of the maintenance of anxiety disorders.
The current study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to evaluate whether worry affects anticipation and processing of threat and neutral pictures during a conditioning task.
"Fifty-two high (n=24) and low (n=28) worriers completed a paradigm in which a neutral stimulus indicated the valence of a second stimulus, either a threat or neutral picture."
"Results found that worriers displayed reduced anticipatory responses to both stimulus types as indexed by the stimulus preceding negativity, although they displayed an increased stimulus preceding negativity to threatening images during the second half of the task."
"In addition, high and low worriers differed in processing of threat and neutral images as indexed by the late positive potential."
"These findings support the overgeneralization of fear literature, suggesting that worriers display difficulty discriminating safety cues from threat cues, and this affects the attentional resources devoted to subsequent stimuli."
Implications of these results are discussed.
Threat-related attentional disruptions in anxiety may relate to changes in cognitive control during task processing.
The present study examined this question using the N2 event-related brain potential.
It was predicted that threat stimuli will selectively influence the N2 for those showing elevated trait anxiety and that reduced N2 may reflect a compensatory process predicting better attention performance.
EEG was recorded while 36 participants completed a cued flanker task with threat or nonthreat distracters.
N2 amplitudes were greater to incongruent versus congruent flankers.
"Following threat, high trait anxious participants showed reduced modulation of the N2 by flanker type and greater N2 amplitudes to congruent flankers."
Reduced N2 was associated with better attention performance.
This study was among the first documenting the emotional modulation of the N2 related to the threat bias and its links with attention interference in anxiety.
"OBJECTIVE: In the treatment of anxiety disorders, attention bias modification therapy (ABMT) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) may have complementary effects by targeting different aspects of perturbed threat responses and behaviors."
"ABMT may target rapid, implicit threat reactions, whereas CBT may target slowly deployed threat responses."
The authors used amygdala-based connectivity during a threat-attention task and a randomized controlled trial design to evaluate potential complementary features of these treatments in pediatric anxiety disorders.
"METHOD: Prior to treatment, youths (8-17 years old) with anxiety disorders (N=54), as well as healthy comparison youths (N=51), performed a threat-attention task during functional MRI acquisition."
Task-related amygdala-based functional connectivity was assessed.
Patients with and without imaging data (N=85) were then randomly assigned to receive CBT paired with either active or placebo ABMT.
"Clinical response was evaluated, and pretreatment amygdala-based connectivity profiles were compared among patients with varying levels of clinical response."
"RESULTS: Compared with the CBT plus placebo ABMT group, the CBT plus active ABMT group exhibited less severe anxiety after treatment."
The patient and healthy comparison groups differed in amygdala-insula connectivity during the threat-attention task.
"Patients whose connectivity profiles were most different from those of the healthy comparison group exhibited the poorest response to treatment, particularly those who received CBT plus placebo ABMT."
CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence of enhanced clinical effects for patients receiving active ABMT.
"Moreover, ABMT appears to be most effective for patients with abnormal amygdala-insula connectivity."
ABMT may target specific threat processes associated with dysfunctional amygdala-insula connectivity that are not targeted by CBT alone.
This may explain the observation of enhanced clinical response to CBT plus active ABMT.
"Aberrant threat perception has been linked to paranoia, anxiety and other mental health problems, and is widely considered to be a core, transdiagnostic feature of psychopathology."
"However, to date there has been only limited investigation of whether mental health problems are associated with a biased interpretation of stimuli that have explicit (as opposed to ambiguous) connotations of threat."
"In the present study, 41 adolescents diagnosed with a mental illness and 45 demographically matched controls were asked to provide danger ratings of stimuli normatively rated as being either low or high in potential threat."
"All participants were also asked to complete background measures of cognitive function, mental health and wellbeing."
"The results indicated that the two groups did not differ in their capacity to discriminate between low and high threat stimuli, nor did they differ in the absolute level of threat that they attributed to these stimuli."
"However, for the control group, the overall level of threat perceived in facial stimuli was correlated with two important indices of mental health (depression and anxiety)."
No associations emerged in the clinical group.
These data are discussed in relation to their potential implications for the role of aberrant threat perception in transdiagnostic models of mental health.
"Social anxiety is the intense fear of negative evaluation by others, and it emerges uniquely from a social situation."
"Given its social origin, we asked whether an anxiety-inducing social situation could enhance the processing of faces linked to the situational threat."
"While past research has focused on how individual differences in social anxiety relate to face processing, we tested the effect of manipulated social anxiety in the context of anxiety about appearing racially prejudiced in front of a peer."
Visual processing of faces was indexed by the N170 component of the event-related potential.
"Participants viewed faces of Black and White males, along with nonfaces, either in private or while being monitored by the experimenter for signs of prejudice in a 'public' condition."
Results revealed a difference in the N170 response to Black and Whites faces that emerged only in the public condition and only among participants high in dispositional social anxiety.
"These results provide new evidence that anxiety arising from the social situation modulates the earliest stages of face processing in a way that is specific to a social threat, and they shed new light on how anxiety effects on perception may contribute to the regulation of intergroup responses."
"Anxiety disorders are associated with enhanced defensive reactivity to errors, measured via the error-related negativity (ERN)."
There is some evidence to suggest that problematic alcohol use is also associated with an enhanced ERN; although prior studies have been almost exclusively in men and have yet to examine the potential interactive effects of anxiety and alcohol abuse symptoms.
The aim of the current study was to address the gaps in this literature by examining the unique and interactive effects of anxiety symptoms and problematic alcohol use on the ERN in a sample of 79 heterogeneous internalizing disorder patients.
All participants completed a flanker task designed to robustly elicit the ERN and questionnaires assessing current internalizing symptoms and problematic alcohol use.
"As expected, results revealed that greater anxiety symptoms, but not depressive symptoms, were associated with a more enhanced ERN."
There was no main effect of problematic alcohol use but there was a significant anxiety by problematic alcohol use interaction.
"At high anxiety symptoms, greater problematic alcohol use was associated with a more enhanced ERN; at low anxiety symptoms, alcohol use was unrelated to the ERN."
There was no depression by alcohol abuse interaction.
"The findings suggest that within anxious individuals, heightened reactivity to errors/threat may be related to risk for alcohol abuse."
The findings also converge with a broader literature suggesting that heightened reactivity to threat may be a shared vulnerability factor for anxiety and alcohol abuse and a novel prevention and intervention target for anxiety-alcohol abuse comorbidity.
BACKGROUND: Neural activity is increasingly used in addition to behavioral measures to study anxiety and attentional biases toward threatening stimuli.
Event-related potentials (ERPs) might be particularly useful because of their excellent temporal resolution.
"In particular, the late positive potential (LPP) reflects increased attention to emotional stimuli-and was recently found to be larger with increasing state anxiety."
This study sought to examine the LPP among individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).
"METHODS: Fifteen individuals with GAD and 15 healthy controls (HCs) viewed briefly presented pairs of aversive and neutral pictures that were presented to the left and right of, as well as above and below, fixation on each trial; ERP and behavioral measures were recorded as participants indicated whether the horizontal or vertical image pairs were the same or different."
"RESULTS: Aversive pictures presented in unattended locations were associated with more errors overall, and this effect was larger in GAD than HC participants."
"Moreover, aversive targets elicited larger LPPs across all participants; this difference was larger in GAD than HC participants when distracters were neutral."
CONCLUSIONS: Threatening stimuli presented in both target and distracting spatial locations have a greater impact on GAD than HC participants.
Behavioral and ERP measures provide complimentary indices of attention toward threat in GAD.
"In terms of attentional control theory, behavioral interference indexes impaired processing effectiveness, whereas the LPP might index reduced processing efficiency in GAD."
Both measures may provide unique windows onto how increased stimulus-driven attention to threat impacts and characterizes GAD.
Worry is characterized by streams of verbal thoughts about potential negative outcomes.
Individuals with high levels of worry (and particularly those with generalized anxiety disorder) find it very difficult to control worry once it has started.
What is not clear is the extent to which verbal negative thinking style maintains worry.
"Our study aimed to disentangle the effects of verbal versus imagery based thinking, and negative versus positive worry-related content on subsequent negative intrusive thoughts."
"High worriers were trained to engage in imagery or verbal processing, focusing on either negative or positive outcomes of their current main worry."
Both thinking style and valence of worry content influenced later negative intrusive thoughts that play a role in initiating worry episodes.
"In contrast, only valence influenced subjective ratings of worry outcomes (i.e., cost, concern, and ability to cope, although not probability), with positive valence leading to lower ratings, irrespective of thinking style."
"Examined the relation between childhood anxiety and threat-perception abnormalities using vignettes in which external (i.e., exposure to potential threat cues) and internal (i.e., experience of anxiety responses) information were systematically varied."
"Nonclinical children (N = 156) aged 8 to 13 years completed anxiety questionnaires and were then exposed to 3 types of stories: ambiguous stories, ambiguous + anxiety-response stories, and nonthreatening stories."
"From children's responses to these stories, a number of threat-perception indexes were derived."
Results showed that both external and internal information inflated children's perception of threat.
"Further, high levels of anxiety were accompanied by enhanced threat perception in response to external threat cues."
"Finally, little evidence was found that high levels of anxiety, and in particular of anxiety sensitivity, were associated with a greater tendency to use internal information (i.e., emotional reasoning)."
Potential avenues for future studies on anxiety-related threat-perception distortions are briefly discussed.
"Anxiety is an adaptive human experience that may occur at all ages and serves to help draw attention to, avoid or cope with immanent threat and danger."
"Given its evolutionary importance, it has strong genetic and biological underpinnings, and when it serves that adaptive function for the organism, anxiety may be viewed as useful."
"However, complex adaptive systems, such as our adaptation to threat or stress, by definition provide many and often interrelated points of breakdown or dysregulation, which, if sustained, may lead to psychopathology."
"Anxiety has been described as a common currency for psychopathology, indicating that it is a first line and universal way for us to respond to stress and threat."
It is more or less prominent in patients diagnosed with practically all psychiatric or neurodegenerative disorders.
"This has lead to the inclusion of anxiety as a cross-cutting symptom measure in the development of DSM-5 (APA, 2013)."
"Given that they are rooted in a complex adaptive system that has many potential points of impact to develop pathology, it is not surprising that anxiety disorders are extremely heterogeneous."
"This heterogeneity of anxiety disorders pertains to symptomatology, etiology and outcomes, and poses great challenges to both research and clinical practice."
Predictability is an important characteristic of threat that impacts defensive motivation and attentional engagement.
"Supporting research has primarily focused on actual threat (e.g., shocks), and it is unclear whether the predictability of less intense threat (e.g., unpleasant pictures) similarly affects motivation and attention."
"The present study utilized a within-subject design and examined defensive motivation (startle reflex and self-reported anxiety) and attention (probe N100 and P300) in anticipation of shocks and unpleasant pictures during a no, predictable, and unpredictable threat task."
This study also examined the impact of predictability on the P300 to shocks and late positive potential (LPP) to unpleasant pictures.
The startle reflex and self-reported anxiety were increased in anticipation of both types of threat relative to no threat.
"Furthermore, startle potentiation in anticipation of unpredictable threat was greater for shocks compared to unpleasant pictures, but there was no difference for predictable threat."
"The probe N100 was enhanced in anticipation of unpredictable threat relative to predictable threat and no threat, and the probe P300 was suppressed in anticipation of predictable and unpredictable threat relative to no threat."
These effects did not differ between the shock and unpleasant picture trials.
"Finally, the P300 and early LPP component were increased in response to unpredictable relative to predictable shocks and unpleasant pictures, respectively."
"The present study suggests that the unpredictability of unpleasant pictures increases defensive motivation, but to a lesser degree relative to actual threat."
"Moreover, unpredictability enhances attentional engagement in anticipation of, and in reaction to, both types of threat."
"OBJECTIVES: Although ambiguous and uncertain situations, such as those dealing with the threat of widespread viral illness, may have pronounced psychological ramifications, there have been few studies that examined the factors that contributed to such outcomes."
The purpose of the present investigation was to examine emotional reactions to a health threat.
"DESIGN: A structural equation model examined the interplay between anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty, as sequentially mediated by appraisals and coping strategies."
"METHODS: Adult participants over the age of 18 (N = 1,027) completed online self-report measures during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009."
"RESULTS: Greater intolerance of uncertainty was related to lower appraisals of self- and other control, which predicted low levels of problem-focused coping and greater reports of H1N1-related anxiety."
"Additionally, individuals with a high intolerance of uncertainty were more likely to perceive the pandemic as threatening and also were more apt to use emotion-focused coping strategies, and both of these factors predicted elevated levels of anxiety."
"CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data indicate that threats, such as those related to a potential pandemic, not only have implications for physical health, but also for psychological distress, and that such outcomes vary with a constellation of appraisal and coping factors."
STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already known on this subject?
It has been established that the public is often confused by the threat that a potential pandemic virus poses and that they are unsure of what information related to the disease they can trust.
"Government health agencies often walk the line of minimizing the threat to prevent panic, but simultaneously emphasize the importance of action (vaccination) to prevent a worldwide pandemic."
What does this study add?
"Beyond the physical threat of a pandemic, a significant psychological toll may occur for certain individuals."
Anxiety regarding H1N1 is heightened amongst those who cannot tolerate uncertainty.
"Appraisals of threat, control, and the use of emotion-focused coping mediate the above relationship."
BACKGROUND: Rodent approach-avoidance conflict tests are common preclinical models of human anxiety disorder.
Their translational validity mainly rests on the observation that anxiolytic drugs reduce rodent anxiety-like behavior.
"Here, we capitalized on a recently developed approach-avoidance conflict computer game to investigate the impact of benzodiazepines and of amygdala lesions on putative human anxiety-like behavior."
"In successive epochs of this game, participants collect monetary tokens on a spatial grid while under threat of virtual predation."
"METHODS: In a preregistered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we tested the effect of a single dose (1 mg) of lorazepam (n = 59)."
We then compared 2 patients with bilateral amygdala lesions due to Urbach-Wiethe syndrome with age- and gender-matched control participants (n = 17).
"Based on a previous report, the primary outcome measure was the effect of intra-epoch time (i.e., an adaptation to increasing potential loss) on presence in the safe quadrant of the spatial grid."
We hypothesized reduced loss adaptation in this measure under lorazepam and in patients with amygdala lesions.
RESULTS: Lorazepam and amygdala lesions reduced loss adaptation in the primary outcome measure.
We found similar results in several secondary outcome measures.
The relative reduction of anxiety-like behavior in patients with amygdala lesions was qualitatively and quantitatively indistinguishable from an impact of anterior hippocampus lesions found in a previous report.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results establish the translational validity of human approach-avoidance conflict tests in terms of anxiolytic drug action.
"We identified the amygdala, in addition to the hippocampus, as a critical structure in human anxiety-like behavior."
Study of the anxiety disorders may be a particularly useful vehicle for demonstrating how foundational sciences (e.g.
"cognitive-affective neuroscience, evolutionary psychology) can advance psychiatric theory and research."
Here we consider important potential advances and remaining future challenges when basic research on threat detection and precautionary responses is used to address the anxiety disorders.
We emphasize the potential value of a model of threat detection and precautionary responses that integrates cognitive-affective neuroscience and evolutionary approaches for understanding the anxiety disorders.
"However, we also suggest that substantial additional work is needed in order to link systematically the psychobiological mechanisms posited by basic work on threat detection and precautionary responses to the complex phenomena seen in the clinic."
"Increased levels of peripheral inflammatory markers, including C-Reactive Protein (CRP), are associated with increased risk for depression, anxiety, and suicidality."
The brain mechanisms that may underlie the association between peripheral inflammation and internalizing problems remain to be determined.
"The present study examines associations between peripheral CRP concentrations and threat-related amygdala activity, a neural biomarker of depression and anxiety risk, in a sample of 172 young adult undergraduate students."
Participants underwent functional MRI scanning while performing an emotional face matching task to obtain a measure of threat-related amygdala activity to angry and fearful faces; CRP concentrations were assayed from dried blood spots.
"Results indicated a significant interaction between CRP and sex: in men, but not women, higher CRP was associated with higher threat-related amygdala activity."
These results add to the literature finding associations between systemic levels of inflammation and brain function and suggest that threat-related amygdala activity may serve as a potential pathway through which heightened chronic inflammation may increase risk for mood and anxiety problems.
