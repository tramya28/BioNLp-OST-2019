Circadian rhythms are endogenously generated recurring patterns of around 24 hours with well-established roles in physiology and behaviour.
These circadian clocks are important in both the aetiology and treatment of various psychiatric and metabolic diseases.
"To maintain physiological homeostasis and optimal functioning, living life synchronised to these clocks is desirable; modern society, however, promotes a '24/7' lifestyle where activity often occurs during the body's 'biological night', resulting in mistimed sleep and circadian misalignment."
This circadian desynchrony can increase the risk of disease and can also influence treatment response.
"Clinicians should be aware of the influence that circadian desynchrony can have on health and disease, in order to potentially develop new therapeutic strategies and to incorporate chronotherapeutics into current treatment strategies to enhance their utility."
BACKGROUND: Research within the last decade has shown melatonin to have previously-unsuspected beneficial actions on the peripheral reproductive organs.
"Likewise, numerous investigations have documented that stable circadian rhythms are also helpful in maintaining reproductive health."
The relationship of melatonin and circadian rhythmicity to maternal and fetal health is summarized in this review.
METHODS: Databases were searched for the related published English literature up to 15 May 2013.
"The search terms used in various combinations included melatonin, circadian rhythms, biological clock, suprachiasmatic nucleus, ovary, pregnancy, uterus, placenta, fetus, pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, ischemia-reperfusion, chronodisruption, antioxidants, oxidative stress and free radicals."
The results of the studies uncovered are summarized herein.
"RESULTS: Both melatonin and circadian rhythms impact reproduction, especially during pregnancy."
Melatonin is a multifaceted molecule with direct free radical scavenging and indirect antioxidant activities.
Melatonin is produced in both the ovary and in the placenta where it protects against molecular mutilation and cellular dysfunction arising from oxidative/nitrosative stress.
"The placenta, in particular, is often a site of excessive free radical generation due to less than optimal adhesion to the uterine wall, which leads to either persistent hypoxia or intermittent hypoxia and reoxygenation, processes that cause massive free radical generation and organ dysfunction."
This may contribute to pre-eclampsia and other disorders which often complicate pregnancy.
Melatonin has ameliorated free radical damage to the placenta and to the fetus in experiments using non-human mammals.
"Likewise, the maintenance of a regular maternal light/dark and sleep/wake cycle is important to stabilize circadian rhythms generated by the maternal central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nuclei."
"Optimal circadian rhythmicity in the mother is important since her circadian clock, either directly or indirectly via the melatonin rhythm, programs the developing master oscillator of the fetus."
"Experimental studies have shown that disturbed maternal circadian rhythms, referred to as chronodisruption, and perturbed melatonin cycles have negative consequences for the maturing fetal oscillators, which may lead to psychological and behavioral problems in the newborn."
"To optimize regular circadian rhythms and prevent disturbances of the melatonin cycle during pregnancy, shift work and bright light exposure at night should be avoided, especially during the last trimester of pregnancy."
"Finally, melatonin synergizes with oxytocin to promote delivery of the fetus."
"Since blood melatonin levels are normally highest during the dark period, the propensity of childbirth to occur at night may relate to the high levels of melatonin at this time which work in concert with oxytocin to enhance the strength of uterine contractions."
"CONCLUSIONS: A number of conclusions naturally evolve from the data summarized in this review: (i) melatonin, of both pineal and placental origin, has essential functions in fetal maturation and placenta/uterine homeostasis; (ii) circadian clock genes, which are components of all cells including those in the peripheral reproductive organs, have important roles in reproductive and organismal (fetal and maternal) physiology; (iii) due to the potent antioxidant actions of melatonin, coupled with its virtual absence of toxicity, this indoleamine may have utility in the treatment of pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, placental and fetal ischemia/reperfusion, etc."
(iv) the propensity for parturition to occur at night may relate to the synergism between the nocturnal increase in melatonin and oxytocin.
The insect antennae receive olfactory information from the environment.
"In some insects, it has been shown that antennal responsiveness is dynamically regulated by circadian clocks."
"However, it is unknown how general this phenomenon is and what functions it serves."
Circadian regulation in honeybee workers is particularly interesting in this regard because they show natural task-related chronobiological plasticity.
"Forager bees show strong circadian rhythms in behavior and brain gene expression, whereas nurse bees tend brood around-the-clock and have attenuated circadian rhythms in activity and whole-brain gene expression."
"Here, we tested the hypothesis that there is task-related plasticity in circadian rhythms of antennal responsiveness to odorants in worker honeybees."
We used electroantennogram (EAG) to measure the antennal responsiveness of nurses and foragers to general odorants and pheromones around the day.
The capacity to track 10-Hz odorant pulses varied with time of day for both task groups but with different phases.
"The antennal pulse-tracking capacity was higher during the subjective day for the day-active foragers, whereas it was better during the night for around-the-clock active nurses."
The task-related phases of pulse-tracking rhythms were similar for all the tested stimuli.
We also found evidence for circadian rhythms in the EAG response magnitude of foragers but not of nurses.
"To the best of our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence for circadian regulation of antennal olfactory responsiveness and odorant pulse-tracking capacity in bees or any other hymenopteran insect."
"Importantly, our study shows for the first time that the circadian phase of olfactory responsiveness may be socially regulated."
"Potassium Channel Interacting Protein 2 (KChIP2) is suggested to be responsible for the circadian rhythm in repolarization duration, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death."
We investigated the hypothesis that there is no circadian rhythm in QT interval in the absence of KChIP2.
"Implanted telemetric devices recorded electrocardiogram continuously for 5 days in conscious wild-type mice (WT, n = 9) and KChIP2(-/-) mice (n = 9) in light:dark periods and in complete darkness."
QT intervals were determined from all RR intervals and corrected for heart rate (QT100 = QT/(RR/100)(1/2)).
"Moreover, QT intervals were determined from complexes within the RR range of mean-RR +/- 1% in the individual mouse (QTmean-RR)."
"We find that RR intervals are 125 +/- 5 ms in WT and 123 +/- 4 ms in KChIP2(-/-) (p = 0.81), and QT intervals are 52 +/- 1 and 52 +/- 1 ms, respectively(p = 0.89)."
No ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac deaths were observed.
We find similar diurnal (light:dark) and circadian (darkness) rhythms of RR intervals in WT and KChIP2(-/-) mice.
"Circadian rhythms in QT100 intervals are present in both groups, but at physiological small amplitudes: 1.6 +/- 0.2 and 1.0 +/- 0.3 ms in WT and KChIP2(-/-), respectively (p = 0.15)."
A diurnal rhythm in QT100 intervals was only found in WT mice.
QTmean-RR intervals display clear diurnal and circadian rhythms in both WT and KChIP2(-/-).
"The amplitude of the circadian rhythm in QTmean-RR is 4.0 +/- 0.3 and 3.1 +/- 0.5 ms in WT and KChIP2(-/-), respectively (p = 0.16)."
"In conclusion, KChIP2 expression does not appear to underlie the circadian rhythm in repolarization duration."
"Dysfunction in 24-h circadian rhythms is a common occurrence in ageing adults; however, circadian rhythm disruptions are more severe in people with age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, and Parkinson's disease."
"Manifestations of circadian rhythm disruptions differ according to the type and severity of neurodegenerative disease and, for some patients, occur before the onset of typical clinical symptoms of neurodegeneration."
"Evidence from preliminary studies suggest that circadian rhythm disruptions, in addition to being a symptom of neurodegeneration, might also be a potential risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, and Parkinson's disease, although large, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this relationship."
"The mechanistic link between circadian rhythms and neurodegeneration is still not fully understood, although proposed underlying pathways include alterations of protein homoeostasis and immune and inflammatory function."
"While preliminary clinical studies are promising, more studies of circadian rhythm disruptions and its mechanisms are required."
"Furthermore, clinical trials are needed to determine whether circadian interventions could prevent or delay the onset of neurodegenerative diseases."
"Very recently, the European Parliament, called to decide on possible abolition of the Daylight Saving Time (DST), approved a resolution calling the scientific community to conduct a more in-depth evaluation."
The question is based on disruption of body's circadian rhythms.
We review here the relationship between DST and cardiovascular health.
"The available evidence suggests the existence of an association between DST and a modest increase of occurrence of acute myocardial infarction, especially in the first week after the spring shift."
"Possible mechanisms include sleep deprivation, circadian misalignment and environmental conditions."
The role of gender and individual preference in circadian rhythms (chronotype) will need further assessment.
"PURPOSE: We evaluated nocturnal urine production and circadian rhythms of renal function (glomerular filtration, and water and solute diuresis) in adults with spinal cord injury compared to controls."
"MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study was done at Ghent University Hospital, Belgium."
Participants were asked to perform a 24-hour urine collection.
"A blood sample was taken to calculate the diuresis rate and the renal clearance of creatinine, free water, solutes, sodium and urea."
"RESULTS: A total of 119 patients were divided into 32 with spinal cord injury, and 68 controls with and 19 without nocturnal polyuria."
"Spinal cord injured patients showed no circadian rhythms in the diuresis rate or in the renal clearance of creatinine, free water, solutes, sodium or urea."
"Controls without nocturnal polyuria reported a lower nighttime diuresis rate and lower nighttime clearance of creatinine, solutes, sodium and urea compared to daytime levels."
Controls with nocturnal polyuria had no circadian rhythms in the diuresis rate or creatinine clearance and a significant increase in nocturnal free water clearance compared to daytime levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Comparing the mechanisms underlying nocturnal urine production between patients with spinal cord injury and controls revealed important differences.
"Spinal cord injured patients showed absent circadian rhythms in the renal clearance of creatinine (glomerular filtration), free water (water diuresis) and solutes such as sodium and urea (solute diuresis)."
Future research must be done to evaluate the role of patient stratification to find the most effective and safe treatment or combination of treatments for spinal cord injured patients with complaints or complications related to nocturnal polyuria.
"Depressive disorders are associated with various neurobiological alterations like hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, altered neuroplasticity and altered circadian rhythms."
"Relating to the circadian symptoms, a process is adopted in which individual genetic factors together with social, psychological and physical stressors may lead to a decompensation of the circadian system."
The causal connections between depressive disorders and disturbed circadian rhythms have not been completely clarified.
Chronobiological therapy is based on these disturbed processes.
"For the treatment of the circadian symptoms, various scientifically tested chronotherapeutics are available with however different effectiveness and evidence like light therapy or sleep deprivation."
The successful treatment of depression also frequently leads to a improvement in altered circadian rhythm.
"Circadian rhythms have been identified in multiple physiological processes that may affect cardiovascular diseases, yet little is known about the impact of circadian rhythm on acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) onset and outcomes in the Middle East."
The relationship between time of symptom onset during the 24-hour circadian cycle and prehospital delays and in-hospital death was assessed in 2909 patients with STEMI presenting in 6 Arabian Gulf countries.
A sinusoidal smoothing function was used to show the average circadian trends.
There was a significant association between time of symptom onset and the circadian cycle.
The STEMIs were more frequent during the late morning and early afternoon hours ( P < .001).
"Patients with pain onset from 0.00 to 5:59 had median prehospital delays of 150 minutes versus 90 minutes from 6:00 to 11:59 and 12:00 to 17:59, respectively ( P < .001)."
"Although there was no significant difference in mortality between the 4 groups ( P = .230), there was a significant association between time of symptom onset as sinusoidal function and in-hospital mortality ( P = .032)."
"Patients with STEMI in the Middle East have significant circadian patterns in symptoms onset, prehospital delay, and timeliness of reperfusion."
A circadian rhythm of in-hospital mortality was found over the 24-hour clock of symptom onset time.
Rhythms can be observed at all levels of the biologic integration in humans.
"The observation that a biological or physiological variable shows a circadian rhythm can be explained by several multifactorial systems including external (exogenous), internal (endogenous) and psychobiological (lifestyle) mechanisms."
"Our body clock can be synchronized with the environment by external factors, called synchronizers, i.e."
"the light-dark cycle, but it is also negatively influenced by some pathological conditions or factors, called chronodisruptors, i.e."
aging or low physical activity (PA).
The desynchronization of a 24-h rhythm in a chronic manner has been recently defined chronodisruption or circadian disruption.
"A very large number of hormonal variables, such as adrenal and gonadal stress steroids, are governed by circadian rhythmicity."
"Such hormones, in normal conditions, show a peak in the first part of the day, while their typical diurnal fluctuations are totally out of sync in subjects affected by cancer or metabolic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome."
"In general, a flatter slope with altered peaks in cortisol and testosterone circadian rhythms has been observed in pathological individuals."
"PA, specifically chronic exercise, seems to play a key role as synchronizer for the whole circadian system in such pathologies even if specific data on steroids circadian pattern are still sparse and contradictory."
"Recently, it has been proposed that low-intensity chronic PA could be an effective intervention to decrease morning cortisol levels in pathological subjects."
The standardization of all confounding factors is needed to reach more clear evidence-based results.
"The Mexican volcano mouse Neotomodon alstoni, is endemic of the Transverse Neovolcanic Ridge in central Mexico."
It is considered as least concern species and has been studied as a potential laboratory model from different perspectives.
"Two lines of research in neuroendocrinology have been addressed: reproduction and parental care, particularly focused on paternal attention and the influence of testosterone, and studies on physiology and behavior of circadian rhythms, focused on the circadian biology of the species, its circadian locomotor activity and daily neuroendocrine regulation of metabolic parameters related to energy balance."
"Some mice, when captive, spontaneously develop obesity, which allows for comparisons between lean and obese mice of daily changes in neuronal and metabolic parameters associated with changes in food intake and locomotor activity."
"This review includes studies that consider this species an attractive animal model where the alteration of circadian rhythms influences the pathogenesis of obesity, specifically with the basic regulation of food intake and metabolism and differences related to sex."
This study can be considered as a reference to the comparative animal physiology among rodents.
"As an ectothermic animal, crayfish immunity and their resistance to pathogen can be significantly affected by environmental factors such as light and temperature."
It has been found for a long time that multiple immune parameters of animals and human are circadian-regulated by light-entrained circadian rhythm.
Whether temperature also affects the immune rhythm of animals still remains unclear.
"In the present study, we investigated the effect of temperature cycles on the rhythm of crayfish immunity and their resistance."
Survival experiments demonstrated that temperature cycles of 24 degrees C and 18 degrees C effectively entrained the circadian rhythm of crayfish resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila in constant dark.
"After being exposed to temperature cycles, the crayfish injected at different time points exhibited significant difference in resistance to A. hydrophila."
"Bacterial growth and total hemocyte count (THC) also showed circadian variation in crayfish subjected to temperature cycles, but phenoloxidase (PO) activity didn't show rhythmic change under the same conditions."
"Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that basal expression of crustin1 and astacidin in crayfish subjected to temperature cycles was circadian-rhythmic, but induced expression by A. hydrophila didn't show the same rhythm."
"In contrast, crayfish maintained at constant temperature showed completely arrhythmic in bacterial resistance, immune parameters mentioned above and the expression of antimicrobial peptides."
The results present here collectively indicated that temperature cycles entrained circadian rhythm of some immune parameters and shaped crayfish resistance to bacteria.
Disordered circadian rhythms are associated with various psychiatric conditions and metabolic diseases.
"We recently established a mouse model of a psychophysiological stress-induced chronic sleep disorder (CSD) characterized by reduced amplitude of circadian wheel-running activity and sleep-wake cycles, sleep fragmentation and hyperphagia."
"Here, we evaluate day-night fluctuations in plasma concentrations of free amino acids (FAA), appetite hormones and prolactin as well as the hepatic expression of circadian clock-related genes in mice with CSD (CSD mice)."
Nocturnal increases in wheel-running activity and circadian rhythms of plasma prolactin concentrations were significantly disrupted in CSD mice.
Hyperphagia with a decreased leptin/ghrelin ratio was found in CSD mice.
Day-night fluctuations in plasma FAA contents were severely disrupted without affecting total FAA levels in CSD mice.
"Nocturnal increases in branched-chain amino acids such as Ile, Leu, and Val were further augmented in CSD mice, while daytime increases in Gly, Ala, Ser, Thr, Lys, Arg, His, Tyr, Met, Cys, Glu, and Asn were significantly attenuated."
"Importantly, the circadian expression of hepatic clock genes was completely unaffected in CSD mice."
These findings suggest that circadian clock gene expression does not always reflect disordered behavior and sleep rhythms and that plasma FFA profiles could serve as a potential biomarker of circadian rhythm disorders.
The circadian clock is an endogenous timing system based on the self-sustained oscillation in individual cells.
"These cellular circadian clocks compose a multicellular circadian system working at respective levels of tissue, organ, plant body."
"However, how numerous cellular clocks are coordinated within a plant has been unclear."
There was little information about behavior of circadian clocks at a single-cell level due to the difficulties in monitoring circadian rhythms of individual cells in an intact plant.
We developed a single-cell bioluminescence imaging system using duckweed as the plant material and succeeded in observing behavior of cellular clocks in intact plants for over a week.
This imaging technique quantitatively revealed heterogeneous and independent manners of cellular clock behaviors.
"Furthermore, these quantitative analyses uncovered the local synchronization of cellular circadian rhythms that implied phase-attractive interactions between cellular clocks."
The cell-to-cell interaction looked to be too weak to coordinate cellular clocks against their heterogeneity under constant conditions.
"On the other hand, under light-dark conditions, the heterogeneity of cellular clocks seemed to be corrected by cell-to-cell interactions so that cellular clocks showed a clear spatial pattern of phases at a whole plant level."
"Thus, it was suggested that the interactions between cellular clocks was an adaptive trait working under day-night cycles to coordinate cellular clocks in a plant body."
These findings provide a novel perspective for understanding spatio-temporal architectures in the plant circadian system.
"Aged animals exhibit diminished circadian rhythms, and both aging and circadian disruption sensitize neuroinflammatory responses."
Microglia-the innate immune cell of the central nervous system-possess endogenous timekeeping mechanisms that regulate immune responses.
"Here, we explored whether aging is associated with disrupted diurnal rhythms in microglia and neuroinflammatory processes."
"First, hippocampal microglia isolated from young rats (4 months F344XBN) rhythmically expressed circadian clock genes, whereas microglia isolated from the hippocampus of aged rats (25 months) had aberrant Per1 and Per2 rhythms."
"Unstimulated microglia from young rats exhibited robust rhythms of TNFalpha and IL-1beta mRNA expression, whereas those from aged rats had flattened and tonically elevated cytokine expression."
"Similarly, microglial activation markers were diurnally regulated in the hippocampus of young but not aged rats and diurnal differences in responsiveness to both ex vivo and in vivo inflammatory challenges were abolished in aged rats."
Corticosterone is an entraining signal for extra-suprachiasmatic nucleus circadian rhythms.
"Here, corticosterone stimulation elicited similar Per1 induction in aged and young microglia."
"Overall, these results indicate that aging dysregulates circadian regulation of neuroinflammatory functions."
Physical exercise is a non-pharmacological treatment for affective disorders.
The mechanisms of its effects are unknown although some suggest a relationship to synchronization of circadian rhythms.
One way to explore mechanisms is to utilize animal models.
We previously demonstrated that the diurnal fat sand rat is an advantageous model for studying the interactions between photoperiods and mood.
The current study was designed to evaluate the effects of voluntary exercise on activity rhythms and anxiety and depression-like behaviors in sand rats as a step towards better understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
Male sand rats were housed in short photoperiod (SP; 5h light/19 h dark) or neutral light (NP; 12h light/12h dark) regimens for 3 weeks and divided into subgroups with or without running wheels.
"Activity was monitored for 3 additional weeks and then animals were tested in the elevated plus-maze, the forced swim test and the social interaction test."
Activity rhythms were enhanced by the running wheels.
"As hypothesized, voluntary exercise had significant effects on SP animals' anxiety- and depression-like behaviors but not on NP animals."
"Results are discussed in the context of interactions between physical exercise, circadian rhythms and mood."
We suggest that the sand rat model can be used to explore the underlying mechanism of the effects of physical exercise for mood disorders.
The circadian clock is a transcriptional network that functions to regulate the expression of genes important in the anticipation of changes in cellular and organ function.
Recent studies have revealed that the recognition of pathogens and subsequent initiation of inflammatory responses are strongly regulated by a macrophage-intrinsic circadian clock.
We hypothesized that the circadian pattern of gene expression might be influenced by inflammatory stimuli and that loss of circadian function in immune cells can promote pro-inflammatory behavior.
"To investigate circadian rhythms in inflammatory cells, peritoneal macrophages were isolated from mPer2luciferase transgenic mice and circadian oscillations were studied in response to stimuli."
"Using Cosinor analysis, we found that LPS significantly altered the circadian period in peritoneal macrophages from mPer2luciferase mice while qPCR data suggested that the pattern of expression of the core circadian gene (Bmal1) was disrupted."
"Inhibition of TLR4 offered protection from the LPS-induced impairment in rhythm, suggesting a role for toll-like receptor signaling."
"To explore the mechanisms involved, we inhibited LPS-stimulated NO and superoxide."
Inhibition of NO synthesis with L-NAME had no effect on circadian rhythms.
"In contrast, inhibition of superoxide with Tempol or PEG-SOD ameliorated the LPS-induced changes in circadian periodicity."
"In gain of function experiments, we found that overexpression of NOX5, a source of ROS, could significantly disrupt circadian function in a circadian reporter cell line (U2OS) whereas iNOS overexpression, a source of NO, was ineffective."
"To assess whether alteration of circadian rhythms influences macrophage function, peritoneal macrophages were isolated from Bmal1-KO and Per-TKO mice."
"Compared to WT macrophages, macrophages from circadian knockout mice exhibited altered balance between NO and ROS release, increased uptake of oxLDL and increased adhesion and migration."
These results suggest that pro-inflammatory stimuli can disrupt circadian rhythms in macrophages and that impaired circadian rhythms may contribute to cardiovascular diseases by altering macrophage behavior.
"BACKGROUND: Migraine is considered a disease with diurnal and 24 h pattern, though the existence of a prevalent circadian rhythm associated to migraine frequency and severity is still not clear."
This observational cross-sectional study aimed to: 1.
Assess the circadian rhythm of migraine attacks onset in a large patients' population selected in a headache center and including episodic and chronic migraine 2.
Analyze the principal characteristic of the different onset time groups 3.
"Verify if migraine features, particularly those associated to chronic and disabling migraine, could be discriminant factors for time of onset group."
"METHODS: We selected 786 consecutive migraine outpatients, who correctly completed the headache diaries for 3 consecutive months and who fulfilled the diagnosis of migraine without aura-MO, migraine with typical aura alone or associated to migraine without aura - MO/MA and chronic migraine - CM."
"For the time of headache onset, we considered four time slots, from 6 to 12 am (morning), from 1 to 6 pm (afternoon), from 7 to 11 pm (evening), from 12 pm to 5 am (night), and an additional category named any time."
Each time slot included the 60 min preceding the next one (e.g.
an onset at 12.30 am was included in 6-12 am time slot).
"We evaluated in all patients the pericranial tenderness, anxiety and depression tracts, headache-related disability, sleep features, quality of life, allodynia and fatigue."
"RESULTS: We scored a total of 16,578 attacks, distributed in the entire day."
"The most of patients, including CM, satisfied the criteria for the any time onset."
Night onset was significantly less represented in the MA/MO group.
"Patients with prevalent night onset were significantly older, with longer migraine history and shorter sleep duration."
Age and illness duration were the variables discriminating the different onset time groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The most of migraine patients do not report a specific circadian profile of attacks occurrence.
"Frequent migraine, severe disability, psychopathological tracts as well as central sensitization signs, do not match with a specific circadian rhythm of attacks onset."
"Night onset migraine seems to be an age related feature, emerging in the course of the disease."
We studied the age-related features of circadian rhythms of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity in the liver of rats under light deprivation.
"In standard light conditions (LD), significant daily fluctuations in SOD activity with a maximum at 07:00 am was detected only in young animals (1,5 months) but catalase activity was observed in young (1,5 months) and in adults (7,5 months) with peak at 04:00 am."
The daily dynamics of total and specific activity of SOD and catalase in the liver in young and adult rats differed depending on the period of ontogeny in which the impact of light deprivation began.
"When the females and offspring were moved to darkness after birth (group LD/DD), the circadian rhythms of SOD and catalase activitys were observed in young and were absent in adult rats."
"However, circadian rhythms of the antioxidant enzymes (AOE) activities were inherent only adult rats when light deprivation impacted on pregnant females (group DD/DD)."
Changes in circadian rhythms under light deprivation were characterized either by a phase shift of the enzymes activity (in the LD/DD group) or by a violation of their develpoment in ontogeny (in the DD/DD group).
During aging significant decreasing of catalase activity was compensated by an increase in the amplitude of circadian rhythms of activity of this enzyme in animals of all groups.
"A distinctive feature of daily fluctuations in AOcapital IE, Cyrillic activity in young rats in LD and LD/DD groups can be considered the presence of an ultradian rhythm in the general circadian cycle, which had a second peak with a smaller amplitude and shorter period."
The plant circadian clock controls various physiological phenomena that are important for adaptation to natural day-night cycles.
"Many components of the circadian clock have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana, the model plant for molecular genetic studies."
Recent studies revealed evolutionary conservation of clock components in green plants.
"Homologues of clock-related genes have been isolated from Lemna gibba and Lemna aequinoctialis, and it has been demonstrated that these homologues function in the clock system in a manner similar to their functioning in Arabidopsis."
"While clock components are widely conserved, circadian phenomena display diversity even within the Lemna genus."
"In order to survey the full extent of diversity in circadian rhythms among duckweed plants, we characterised the circadian rhythms of duckweed by employing a semi-transient bioluminescent reporter system."
"Using a particle bombardment method, circadian bioluminescent reporters were introduced into nine strains representing five duckweed species: Spirodela polyrhiza, Landoltia punctata, Lemna gibba, L. aequinoctialis and Wolffia columbiana."
"We then monitored luciferase (luc+) reporter activities driven by AtCCA1, ZmUBQ1 or CaMV35S promoters under entrainment and free-running conditions."
"Under entrainment, AtCCA1::luc+ showed similar diurnal rhythms in all strains."
This suggests that the mechanism of biological timing under day-night cycles is conserved throughout the evolution of duckweeds.
"Under free-running conditions, we observed circadian rhythms of AtCCA1::luc+, ZmUBQ1::luc+ and CaMV35S::luc+."
"These circadian rhythms showed diversity in period length and sustainability, suggesting that circadian clock mechanisms are somewhat diversified among duckweeds."
Circadian rhythms are biorhythms with a 24-hour period that are regulated by molecular clocks.
"Several clinical and animal models have been developed to analyze the role of these rhythms in cardiovascular physiology, disease and therapy, but a convenient in vitro model that mimics both molecular and functional circadian effects of the heart is not available."
"Therefore, we established a neonatal rat cardiomyocyte model that recapitulates in vivo circadian rhythmicity, as measured by anti-phasic oscillatory mRNA expression of two core clock genes, Bmal1 and Per2 and that shows functional dependence on the clock as indicated by an oscillating response in apoptosis induced by doxorubicin, hydroperoxide or hypoxia."
"In addition, perturbation of the cardiac clock by the use of several compounds including Resveratrol and Ex-527 was found to result in loss of functional rhythmicity."
This indicates that neonatal rat cardiomyocytes are a good model to investigate the cardiac circadian clock as well as a system that allows for fast and easy preclinical testing of the influence of compounds on circadian rhythmicity that might have crucial effects on cardiac health.
Circadian rhythm abnormalities have been recognized as a central feature of bipolar disorder (BD) but a coherent biological explanation for them remains lacking.
"Using genetic mutation of 'clock genes', robust animal models of mania and depression have been developed that elucidate key aspects of circadian rhythms and the circadian clock-mood connection."
"However, translation of this knowledge into humans remains incomplete."
"In recent years, very large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted and the genetic underpinnings of BD are beginning to emerge."
"However, these genetic studies in BD do not match well with the evidence from animal studies that implicate the circadian clock in mood regulation."
"Even larger GWAS have been conducted for circadian phenotypes including chronotype, rhythm amplitude, sleep duration, and insomnia."
"These studies have identified a diverse set of associated genes, including a minority with previously well-characterized functions in the circadian clock."
"Taken together, the data from recent GWAS of BD and circadian phenotypes indicate that the genetic organization of the circadian clock, both in health and in BD is complex."
The findings from GWAS elucidate potentially novel circadian mechanism that may be partly distinct from those identified in animal models.
"Pleiotropy, epistasis and nongenetic factors may play important roles in regulating circadian rhythms, some of which may underlie circadian rhythm disturbances in BD."
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We review recent evidence for circadian rhythm dysregulation in bipolar spectrum disorders (BSDs).
We examine evidence for endogenous abnormalities in the biological clock and disruptions in the external entrainment of circadian rhythms in BSDs.
We also address whether circadian dysregulation provides vulnerability to onset of BSD and evidence for a new integration of reward and circadian dysregulation in BSD.
"RECENT FINDINGS: Relative circadian phase delay (e.g., later melatonin peak, evening chronotype) is associated with BSD, particularly in the depressive phase."
"More consistent evidence supports irregularity of social rhythms, sleep/wake and activity patterns, and disruptions of social rhythms by life events, as stable trait markers of BSD and potential vulnerabilities for BSD onset."
Growing research supports an integrative reward/circadian model.
Both endogenous abnormalities in the biological clock pacemaking function and disruptions in the external entrainment of circadian rhythms by physical and social cues are involved in BSDs.
Circadian dysregulation may provide vulnerability to BSD onset.
"Presently, about 12% of the population is 65 years or older and by the year 2030 that figure is expected to reach 21%."
"In order to promote the well-being of the elderly and to reduce the costs associated with health care demands, increased longevity should be accompanied by ageing attenuation."
"Energy restriction, which limits the amount of energy consumed to 60-70% of the daily intake, and intermittent fasting, which allows the food to be available ad libitum every other day, extend the life span of mammals and prevent or delay the onset of major age-related diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and cataracts."
"Recently, we have shown that well-being can be achieved by resetting of the circadian clock and induction of robust catabolic circadian rhythms via timed feeding."
"In addition, the clock mechanism regulates metabolism and major metabolic proteins are key factors in the core clock mechanism."
"Therefore, it is necessary to increase our understanding of circadian regulation over metabolism and longevity and to design new therapies based on this regulation."
"This review will explore the present data in the field of circadian rhythms, ageing and metabolism."
Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common clinical phenomenon characterized by cognitive deficits in patients after anesthesia and surgery.
Advanced age is a significant independent risk factor for POCD.
"We previously reported that in young mice, sleep-wake rhythm is involved in the isoflurane-induced memory impairment."
"In present study, we sought to determine whether advanced age increased the risk of POCD through aggravated and prolonged post-anesthetic circadian disruption in the elderly."
We constructed POCD model by submitting the mice to 5-h 1.3% isoflurane anesthesia from Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 14 to ZT19.
"Under novel object recognition assay (NOR) and Morris water maze (MWM) test, We found 5-h isoflurane anesthesia impaired the cognition of young mice for early 3 days after anesthesia but damaged the aged for at least 1 week."
"With Mini-Mitter continuously monitoring, a 3.22+/-0.75h gross motor activity acrophase delay was manifested in young mice on D1, while in the aged mice, the gross motor activity phase shift lasted for 3 days, consistent with the body temperature rhythm trends of change."
Melatonin has been considered as an effective remedy for circadian rhythm shift.
"In aged mice, melatonin was pretreated intragastrically at the dose of 10mg/kg daily for 7 consecutive days before anesthesia."
We found that melatonin prevented isoflurane-induced cognitive impairments by restoring the locomotor activity and temperature circadian rhythm via clock gene resynchronization.
"Overall, these results indicated that Long-term isoflurane anesthesia induced more aggravated and prolonged memory deficits and circadian rhythms disruption in aged mice."
Melatonin could prevent isoflurane-induced cognitive impairments by circadian rhythm resynchronization.
"In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is the site of the main circadian clock, synchronized by the light-dark cycle, which generates behavioral rhythms like feeding, drinking and activity."
"Notwithstanding, the main role of the SCN clock on the control of all circadian rhythms has been questioned due to the presence of clock activity in many brain areas, including those implicated in the regulation of feeding and reward."
"Moreover, whether circadian rhythms of particular motivated behaviors exist is unknown."
"Here, we evaluated the spontaneous daily and circadian behavior of consumption of a sweet caloric solution (5-10% sucrose), and the effects of sucrose intake on the expression of clock genes in the mouse brain."
Mice showed a daily (in a light-dark cycle) and a circadian (in constant darkness conditions) rhythm in the intake and sucrose preference with a rise for both parameters at night (or subjective night).
"In addition, we observed changes in the circadian day-night expression of the clock gene Per2 in the SCN, cortex and striatum of animals ingesting sucrose compared to control mice on pure water."
"Finally, daily rhythms of sucrose intake and preference were abolished in Per2(Brdm1)- and double Per1(-/-)Per2(Brdm1)-mutant animals."
These data indicate that the expression of circadian rhythms of hedonic feeding behaviors may be controlled by brain circadian clocks and Per gene expression.
"The avian pineal gland, an independent circadian oscillator, receives external photic cues and translates them for the rhythmical synthesis of melatonin."
Our previous study found that monochromatic green light could increase the secretion of melatonin and expression of CLOCK and BMAL1 in chick pinealocytes.
This study further investigated the role of BMAL1 and CLOCK in monochromatic green light-induced melatonin secretion in chick pinealocytes using siRNAs interference and overexpression techniques.
"The results showed that si-BMAL1 destroyed the circadian rhythms of AANAT and melatonin, along with the disruption of the expression of all the seven clock genes, except CRY1."
"Furthermore, overexpression of BMAL1 also disturbed the circadian rhythms of AANAT and melatonin, in addition to causing arrhythmic expression of BMAL1 and CRY1/2, but had no effect on the circadian rhythms of CLOCK, BMAL2 and PER2/3."
"The knockdown or overexpression of CLOCK had no impact on the circadian rhythms of AANAT, melatonin, BMAL1 and PER2, but it significantly deregulated the circadian rhythms of CLOCK, BMAL2, CRY1/2 and PER3."
These results suggested that BMAL1 rather than CLOCK plays a critical role in the regulation of monochromatic green light-induced melatonin rhythm synthesis in chicken pinealocytes.
"Moreover, both knockdown and overexpression of BMAL1 could change the expression levels of CRY2, it indicated CRY2 may be involved in the BMAL1 pathway by modulating the circadian rhythms of AANAT and melatonin."
BACKGROUND: The poor prognostic of Bipolar disorders (BD) is closely linked to deaths by suicide.
Sleep and circadian abnormalities are observed during all phases of BD and are also associated with suicide attempt (SA).
"In this context, this study sought to identify specific sleep and circadian rhythms markers associated with suicidal attempt in euthymic patients with BD."
"METHODS: The sample (N=236) comprised 3 groups: 147 patients with BD including 57 with a history of SA and 90 without (NoSA), and 89 healthy controls (HC)."
All participants were recorded during 21 days with actigraphy.
"RESULTS: SA was associated with women gender (p=0.03), familial history of SA (p=0.03), mixed episodes (p = 0.001), and benzodiazepines (p = 0.019)."
"SA, compared to noSA, had a morning phase preference (p=0.04), and were more vigorous on the circadian type inventory (p=0.04), and tended to suffer more from insomnia (45% versus 25% respectively, p=0.10)."
SA was also associated with an earlier onset of daily activity assessed with actigraphy (M10 onset: p=0.01).
"Backward stepwise linear regression indicated that a combination of four variables (Gender, vigour, insomnia, M10onset) significantly differentiated patients with SA from NoSA (p=0.03)."
"LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional design, and no examination of suicidal behaviors' subgroups such as first attempters or repeaters, or violent suicide attempt."
"CONCLUSIONS: Woman gender, vigorous circadian type, insomnia and an earlier daily activity appeared independently associated with SA in BD."
"If these biomarkers are confirmed in prospective studies, they should be screened and used to prevent suicide, with the development of personal and targeted chronobiological treatments."
"The aim of this study was to compare the availability of diurnal and nocturnal light in two residences for aged persons (R1 and R2, Palma de Mallorca, Illes Balears, Spain)."
We found that the R1 inmates were exposed to lower amounts of light during waking time and higher amounts during sleeping time.
The main traits of the circadian rhythms and the quality of sleep in the inmates of the two residences were found to be positively related to the availability of light during waking time and negatively to the increased light exposure during bed time.
"In addition, the sleep of R1 inmates suffered higher disturbances as a consequence of the different policy for nocturnal diapers check and change."
"Altogether, these two factors may explain the differences observed in the two residences regarding the circadian rhythms, health status and quality of life."
Two conclusions stem from these results: (1) the circadian rhythms of aged people are particularly sensitive to the contrast between diurnal and nocturnal light and (2) the nursing staff of institutions for aged people must receive specific formation on the best practices for maintaining the circadian health of aged people.
Circadian rhythms of physiology and behavior are widespread\break mechanisms in many organisms.
"The internal biological rhythms are driven by molecular clocks, which oscillate with a period nearly but not exactly 24 hours."
"Many classic models of circadian rhythms are based on a time-delayed negative feedback, suggested by the protein products inhibiting transcription of their own genes."
"In 1999, based on stabilization of PER upon dimerization, Tyson et al."
"[J. J. Tyson, C. I. Hong, C. D. Thron, B. Novak, Biophys."
J.
77 (1999) 2411--2417] proposed a crucial positive feedback to the circadian oscillator.
This idea was mathematically expressed in a three-dimensional model.
"By imposing assumptions that the dimerization reactions were fast and dimeric proteins were in rapid equilibrium, they reduced the model to a pair of nonlinear ordinary differential equations of mRNA and total protein concentrations."
Then they used phase plane analysis tools to investigate circadian rhythms.
"In this paper, the original three-dimensional model is studied."
We explore the existence of oscillations and their periods.
Much attention is paid to investigate how the periods depend on model parameters.
The numerical simulations are in good agreement with their reduced work.
