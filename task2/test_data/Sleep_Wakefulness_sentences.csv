The present study was performed to examine the sedative effects of second-generation histamine H(1) receptor antagonist using power spectrum analysis in the rat.
"Similar to ketotifen, olopatadine caused a decrease in sleep latency at a dose of 50 mg/kg, while epinastine and cetirizine showed no significant effect even at a dose of 50 mg/kg."
"On the other hand, no significant difference was observed in the total times of wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement sleep by any drugs used in the experiments."
The number of sleep phases and interval between sleep phases were also unchanged by these drugs.
Ketotifen and olopatadine inhibited [(3)H]mepyramine binding to rat brain homogenates in parallel with a decrease in sleep latency.
No significant effect was observed with epinastine and cetirizine on [(3)H]mepyramine binding.
These findings suggest that the differences in the central nervous system (CNS) depressant effect observed in second generation H(1) receptor antagonists may be due to their liability to penetrate into the CNS.
A 24 hour variation of core body temperature in humans is primarily regulated by the endogenous circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
"And the expression of circadian rhythm is modified by the thermoregulatory mechanism controlling heat production and heat loss, which also show circadian rhythms."
"On the other hand, circadian rhythms in sleep-wakefulness are expressed by two independent but mutually coupled oscillators, the circadian pacemaker and the oscillator specific to sleep-wakefulness."
"However, neither the mechanism nor the site of oscillation of the latter is known."
The time cues for these two oscillators are different.
They are usually but frequently uncoupled under free-running conditions.
"Body temperature and sleep-wakefulness influence the counterpart in various extents, exerting masking effects on either circadian rhythm."
"Acute stress is known to modify sleep-wakefulness cycle, although with considerable interindividual differences."
The origin of these individual differences remains unknown.
"One possibility is an involvement of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), as its reactivity is correlated with an individual's behavioral reactivity to stress, and it is known to influence the sleep-wakefulness cycle."
The present study was designed to analyze relationships between natural differences in behavioral reactivity to stress associated with differential HPA reactivity and stress-induced changes in sleep-wakefulness.
Adult rats were classified into two sub-groups according to their locomotor reactivity to a mild stress (novel environment): the 'low responders (LR)' and the 'high responders (HR)' animals exhibited different glucocorticoid secretion in response to stress.
We show that immobilization stress induced an increase in wakefulness in LR animals and a decrease in wakefulness in HR animals.
"On the other hand, paradoxical sleep was increased in both LR and HR animals."
"Moreover, we observed that LR animals slept more than the HR animals, whereas the two groups had similar levels of paradoxical sleep."
"These results indicate that the response of the sleep-wakefulness cycle to stress is related to the behavioral reactivity to stress, in turn governed by the individual's reactivity of the HPA axis."
The involvement of dopaminergic mechanisms is discussed.
Hypothalamic neurons expressing neuropeptide orexins are critically involved in the control of sleep and wakefulness.
"Although the activity of orexin neurons is thought to be influenced by various neuronal input as well as humoral factors, the direct consequences of changes in the activity of these neurons in an intact animal are largely unknown."
We therefore examined the effects of orexin neuron-specific pharmacogenetic modulation in vivo by a new method called the Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs approach (DREADD).
"Using this system, we successfully activated and suppressed orexin neurons as measured by Fos staining."
EEG and EMG recordings suggested that excitation of orexin neurons significantly increased the amount of time spent in wakefulness and decreased both non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep times.
Inhibition of orexin neurons decreased wakefulness time and increased NREM sleep time.
"These findings clearly show that changes in the activity of orexin neurons can alter the behavioral state of animals and also validate this novel approach for manipulating neuronal activity in awake, freely-moving animals."
The medial preoptico-anterior hypothalamic area receives adrenergic as well as cholinergic inputs.
"Independent studies showed that both these inputs influence sleep, wakefulness and body temperature."
The role of the adrenergic inputs was studied earlier.
The role of cholinergic inputs is reported here.
"The cholinergic agonist, carbachol, and antagonist, scopolamine, were injected into this area during the day and the night in freely moving rats and the effects on sleep-wakefulness and body temperature studied."
"It was observed that carbachol induced wakefulness accompanied by a fall in body temperature while scopolamine induced an opposite effect, i.e."
sleep accompanied by an increase in body temperature.
This suggested that the cholinergic input into the medial preoptic area is spontaneously active in regulating sleep-wakefulness and body temperature and this regulation is mediated through muscarinic receptors present in this area.
"The results also suggest that, contrary to the action of adrenergic inputs (which have a dissociated effect on sleep-wakefulness and body temperature), the cholinergic input is unlikely to have a dissociated effect on those functions."
"Although, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus acts as the central clock in mammals, the circadian expression of clock genes has been demonstrated not only in the SCN, but also in peripheral tissues and brain regions outside the SCN."
"However, the physiological roles of extra-SCN circadian clocks in the brain remain largely elusive."
"In response, we generated Nkx2.1-Bmal1(-/-) mice in which Bmal1, an essential clock component, was genetically deleted specifically in the ventral forebrain, including the preoptic area, nucleus of the diagonal band, and most of the hypothalamus except the SCN."
"In these mice, as expected, PER2::LUC oscillation was drastically attenuated in the explants of mediobasal hypothalamus, whereas it was maintained in those of the SCN."
"Although, Nkx2.1-Bmal1(-/-) mice were rhythmic and nocturnal, they showed altered patterns of locomotor activity during the night in a 12:12-h light:dark cycle and during subjective night in constant darkness."
"Control mice were more active during the first half than the second half of the dark phase or subjective night, whereas Nkx2.1-Bmal1(-/-) mice showed the opposite pattern of locomotor activity."
Temporal patterns of sleep-wakefulness and feeding also changed accordingly.
"Such results suggest that along with mechanisms in the SCN, local Bmal1-dependent clocks in the ventral forebrain are critical for generating precise temporal patterns of circadian behaviors."
"Hypocretins (also called orexins) are two newly discovered neuropeptides originating from the same precursor, preprohypocretin."
The amino-acid sequences of hypocretin are highly conserved among vertebrates.
"Cells bodies of hypocretin neurons are restricted mainly to the lateral and ventral hypothalamus, while hypocretin fibers project throughout the brain, including several areas implicated in the regulation of the sleep/wakefulness cycle."
"Hypocretins act on their targets via two specific, membrane-bound, G-protein-coupled receptors, Hcrtr-1 and Hcrtr-2."
"Among the various physiological actions ascribed to hypocretins, the strongest evidence are for their involvement in the integration and stabilization of arousal networks."
"Degeneration of hypocretin neurons or genetic mutations that prevent the normal synthesis of hypocretins, or their receptors, cause human and animal narcolepsy, a neurological disorder of excessive sleepiness and abnormalities in REM sleep."
Recent data point to an autoimmune origin for human narcolepsy.
It is believed that understanding the role of hypocretins in the pathology of narcolepsy will create the basis for the development of new strategies to effectively treat this disease.
"It is estimated that 15 to 25% of the U.S. labor force works night, evening, or rotating shifts."
"These non-traditional schedules can affect the circadian rhythm, a self-sustained rhythm of biological processes that plays an important role in modulating sleep/wake function, resulting in circadian rhythm sleep disorder, shift work type, usually referred to as shift work disorder."
The disorder consists of a constant or recurrent pattern of sleep interruption that results in insomnia when sleep is needed and excessive sleepiness during waking hours.
"Clinicians need more information about the role of the circadian rhythm in human functioning as well as the pathophysiology, prevalence, and consequences of shift work disorder, so that they can recognize and diagnose this problem in clinical practice."
"As the most important site for sleep-wakefulness change, the role of the hypothalamus is particularly emphasized based on our long term experimental data."
"After rostral midbrain transection, ECoG of the isolated forebrain recovered sleep-wakefulness change, with circadian rhythm, one week after transection."
"In this preparation, after additional bilateral preoptic or posterior hypothalamic lesions, ECoG insomnia or coma pattern appeared, respectively."
"Therefore, the mechanism of sleep-wakefulness change of the forebrain primarily does not depend on the lower brain stem structures such as the raphe nuclei and midbrain reticular formation."
"Hypothalamic sleep-wakefulness mechanism usually receives strong influence from the suprachiasmatic nucleus, but it can exert its own ultradian rhythms (very irregular though) in intact rats or in rats with suprachiasmatic lesions."
Daily rhythms in sleep and waking performance are generated by the interplay of multiple external and internal oscillators.
"These include the light-dark and social cycles, a circadian hypothalamic oscillator oscillating virtually independently of behavior, and a homeostatic oscillator driven primarily by sleep-wake behavior."
"Both internal oscillators contribute to variation in many aspects of sleep and wakefulness (e.g., sleep timing and duration, REM sleep, non-REM sleep, REM density, sleep spindles, slow-wave sleep, electroencephalographic oscillations during wakefulness and sleep, and performance parameters, including attention and memory)."
The relative contribution of the oscillators varies greatly between these variables.
Sleep and performance cannot be predicted by either oscillator independently but critically depend on their phase relationship and amplitude.
The homeostatic oscillator feeds back onto the central pacemaker or its outputs.
"Thus, the amplitude of observed circadian variation in sleep and performance depends on how long we have been asleep or awake."
"During entrainment to external 24-h cycles, the opposing interplay between circadian and homeostatic changes in sleep propensity consolidates sleep and wakefulness."
"Some physiological correlates and mediators of both the circadian process (e.g., melatonin and hypocretin rhythms) and the homeostat (e.g., EEG, slow-wave activity, and adenosine release) have been established, offering targets for the development of countermeasures for circadian sleep and performance disorders."
"Interindividual differences in sleep timing, duration, and morning or evening preference are associated with changes of circadian or sleep homeostatic processes or both."
"Molecular genetic correlates, including polymorphisms in clock genes, of some of these interindividual differences are emerging."
"Recent evidence suggests that synaptic plasticity occurs during homeostatic processes, including sleep-wakefulness regulation, although the underlying mechanisms are not well understood."
Polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA NCAM) is a transmembrane protein that has been implicated in various forms of plasticity.
"To investigate whether PSA NCAM is involved in the neuronal plasticity associated with spontaneous sleep-wakefulness regulation and sleep homeostasis, four studies were conducted using rats."
"First, we showed that PSA NCAM immunoreactivity is present in close proximity to key neurons in several nuclei of the sleep-wakefulness system, including the tuberomammillary hypothalamic nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, and locus coeruleus."
"Second, using western blot analysis and densitometric image analysis of immunoreactivity, we found that 6 h of sleep deprivation changed neither the levels nor the general location of PSA NCAM in the sleep-wakefulness system."
"Finally, we injected endoneuraminidase (Endo N) intracerebroventricularly to examine the effects of polysialic acid removal on sleep-wakefulness states and electroencephalogram (EEG) slow waves at both baseline and during recovery from 6 h of sleep deprivation."
"Endo N-treated rats showed a small but significant decrease in baseline rapid eye movement (REM) sleep selectively in the late light phase, and a facilitated REM sleep rebound after sleep deprivation, as compared with saline-injected controls."
"Non-REM sleep and wakefulness were unaffected by Endo N. These results suggest that PSA NCAM is not particularly involved in the regulation of wakefulness or non-REM sleep, but plays a role in the diurnal pattern of REM sleep as well as in some aspects of REM sleep homeostasis."
"BACKGROUND: Previously, we have shown that transgenic cells bearing the GDNF gene with deleted pre- and pro-regions (mGDNF) can release transgenic GDNF."
The medium conditioned by transgenic cells with mGDNF induced axonal growth in rat embryonic spinal ganglion in vitro.
Here we demonstrate a neurotrophic effect of mGDNF on PC12 cells in vitro as well as its neuroprotective effect on dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta in vivo as indicated by improved motor coordination and sleep-wakefulness cycle in the MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease.
RESULTS: HEK293 cells were transfected with a vector encoding an isoform of the human GDNF gene with deleted pre- and pro-regions (mGDNF).
This factor in the medium conditioned by the transfected cells was shown to induce axonal growth in PC12 cells.
"The early Parkinson's disease model was established by injection of the dopaminergic pro-neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) into C57Bl/6 mice."
Transgenic HEK293/mGDNF/GFP cells were transplanted into the striatum (caudate-putamen) of experimental mice.
The sleep-wakefulness cycle was studied by continuous EEG and motor activity monitoring 1 and 2 weeks after MPTP injection.
"After the experiment, the motor coordination of experimental animals was evaluated in the rotarod test, and dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta were counted in cross-sections of the midbrain."
"MPTP administration lowered the number of tyrosine hydroxylase immunopositive cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta, decreased motor coordination, and increased the total wake time during the dark period."
"The transplantation of HEK293/mGDNF cells into the caudate-putamen 3 days prior to MPTP injection smoothed these effects, while the control transplantation of HEK293 cells showed no notable impact."
"CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation of transgenic cells with the GDNF gene lacking the pre- and pro-sequences can protect dopaminergic neurons in the mouse midbrain from the subsequent administration of the pro-neurotoxin MPTP, which is confirmed by polysomnographic, behavioral and histochemical data."
Hence it is released from transfected cells and preserves the differentiation activity and neuroprotective properties.
The effects of microinjection of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and serotonin (5-HT) into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) on the activity of dopamine neurons in VTA and sleep-wakefulness were studied in rats.
"It was observed that in aneasthetized rats microinjection of GABA (25 micrograms) and 5-HT (2 micrograms) respectively decreased or increased the level of 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) to 68.2% (P < 0.01) and to 136.1% (P < 0.01) of control value in the nucleus accumbens (Acb)."
It was also observed that in free moving rats the time of wakefulness was respectively decreased and increased by the two drugs.
"Furthermore, the time of wakefulness was enhanced following microinjection of dopamine (10 micrograms) into Acb, an effect that could be blocked by haloperidal (16 pmol), but not by SCH23390 (2 nmol)."
"The above results suggest that bilateral microinjection of GABA and 5-HT into VTA could exert respectively an inhibitory or an excitatory action on the dopamine neurons in VTA, mediating the sleep-wakefulness effect probably through the mesolimbic system."
"The comparative immunohistochemical researches of dofamine containing neurons and fibers are carried uot in telencephalic and diencephalic departments of the brain in different vertebratts (adults rats, rats aged 14 and 30 days and frogs)."
"For analysis of quantitative changes dynamics in thyrozinhydroxylase, D1 and D2 immunoreactive material in sleep-wakefulness cycle the model of sleepdeprivation is used."
There are found the facts of morphofunctional correlations in the reactions of dophaminergic system during ontogeny and phylogeny.
"Besides, the pharmacological effects of dofamine agonist and antagonists on the sleep-wakefulness cycle in young rats and in frogs are shown."
"So, dopamine and its agonist apomorphine increase in sleep-wakefulness cycle duration of sleep-like state ofcataplexy (homolog of the sleep) in frogs, in 30-day-old rats it increase the share of wakefulness and catalepsy."
"D1 receptors antagonist (SCH 23390) adminisrated to frogs, caused increase of wakefulness and catatonic type states duration, where as D2 receptors antagonist (apomorphine) increased cataleptic condition."
"Administration of dopamine antagonist (haloperidol) to 30-day-old rats previously causes the increase of cataleptic state, after which the slow wave sleep state is enhanced."
"The questions of phylo-, ontogenetic formation of dopaminergic system regulating role in sleep-wakefulness cycle, when transition mainly from neurosecretory diencephalic influences of dophamine to the mainly neurotransmittory functins of telencephalic regions occured, is discussed."
Increased bodily CO2 concentration alters cellular pH as well as sleep.
"The proton pump, which plays an important role in the homeostatic regulation of cellular pH, therefore, may modulate sleep."
We investigated the effects of the proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole on sleep-wakefulness.
Male Wistar rats were surgically prepared for chronic polysomnographic recordings.
Two different doses of lansoprazole (low: 1 mg/kg; high: 10 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally in the same animal (n = 7) and sleep-wakefulness was recorded for 6 hrs.
The changes in sleep-wakefulness were compared statistically.
"Percent REM sleep amount in the vehicle and lansoprazole low dose groups was 9.26 +/- 1.03 and 9.09 +/- 0.54, respectively, which increased significantly in the lansoprazole high dose group by 31.75% (from vehicle) and 34.21% (from low dose)."
"Also, REM sleep episode numbers significantly increased in lansoprazole high dose group."
"Further, the sodium-hydrogen exchanger blocker amiloride (10 mg/kg; i.p.)"
(n = 5) did not alter sleep-wake architecture.
Our results suggest that the proton pump plays an important role in REM sleep modulation and supports our view that REM sleep might act as a sentinel to help maintain normal CO2 level for unperturbed sleep.
"Deficiency of orexin, a newly discovered hypothalamic peptide, is thought to lead to abnormal sleepiness and cataplexy in both human narcolepsy and animal models of the disease."
"As the POA contains extensive orexin terminals and is established as a sleep/arousal regulatory site, we evaluated a hypothesis that this site is a target for the arousal-inducing effects of orexin."
Orexin-A was microinjected into lateral preoptic area (IPOA) and the effects on sleep-wakefulness and brain temperature were studied.
"Compared to saline vehicle control, orexin-A induced an increase in wakefulness for 70 min and suppressed all sleep stages, especially SWS2 and REM for 80 and 90 min, respectively."
Brain temperature was not differentially affected by orexin-A compared to saline control.
The orexin-induced arousal and REM suppression are consistent with the orexin-deficiency model of narcolepsy.
Our results suggest that the IPOA orexin terminal field or adjacent structures may be a locus of arousal regulation by this peptide and a substrate of sleep-wake regulatory deficits in narcolepsy.
Norepinephrine (NE)-containing locus ceruleus (LC) has been known to participate in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle according to the differential firing rate.
"The aim of this study was to know the change of extracellular NE level in the rat amygdala, which are reciprocally connected with LC, during sleep-wakefulness."
Extracellular NE levels in the rat amygdala were investigated during different stages of the sleep-waking cycle using in vivo microdialysis and polygraphic recording.
Dialysates were collected every 5 min and correlated with the results of polygraphic recording.
The content of NE was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection.
"NE level was the highest in active waking (AW) and, when compared to AW, NE level was progressively lower in quiet waking (QW; 86%), quiet sleep (QS; 72%), and active sleep (AS or REM sleep; 61%)."
This result suggests that the rat amygdala also participates in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle according to the differential NE release.
"The changes in brain temperature and sleep-wakefulness were studied in rats during their exposure to different ambient temperatures of 18 degrees C, 24 degrees C and 30 degrees C, before and after N-methyl D-aspartic acid lesion of the medial preoptic area."
"The medial preoptic area lesion produced a decrease in sleep, and increase in brain temperature except at 30 degrees C. Increase and decrease in brain temperature with slow wave sleep and paradoxical sleep respectively, were observed both in normal and lesioned rats."
Sleep-wakefulness and brain temperature cycle durations were increased and their frequencies decreased at higher ambient temperature in normal rats.
"After the medial preoptic area lesion, sleep-wakefulness cycle duration was decreased and frequency increased at 30 degrees C. There was no significant change in brain temperature cycles at higher ambient temperature in lesioned rats."
"The medial preoptic area, in normal rats, possibly interlinks the neuronal circuits involved in regulating brain temperature and sleep-wakefulness cycles."
The medial preoptic area is essential for increasing the sleep-wakefulness cycle duration with higher ambient temperature.
The possible contribution of the increased brain temperature variation in producing sleep-wakefulness changes cannot be ruled out.
The results of the study show that this area may serve as a fine tuning mechanism which helps to interlink the sleep-wakefulness with the thermoregulation.
Increased activity of the histaminergic neurons of the posterior hypothalamus has been implicated in the facilitation of behavioral wakefulness.
Recent evidence of reciprocal projections between the sleep-active neurons of the preoptic/anterior hypothalamus and the histaminergic neurons of the tuberomammillary nucleus suggests that histaminergic innervation of the preoptic/anterior hypothalamic area may be of particular importance in the wakefulness-promoting properties of histamine.
"To test this possibility, we used microdialysis sample collection in the preoptic/anterior hypothalamic area of cats during natural sleep-wakefulness cycles, 6 h of sleep deprivation induced by gentle handling/playing, and recovery sleep."
Samples were analyzed by a sensitive radioenzymatic assay.
Mean basal levels of histamine in microdialysate during periods of wakefulness (1.155+/-0.225 pg/microl) did not vary during the 6 h of sleep deprivation.
"However, during the different sleep states, dramatic changes were observed in the extracellular histamine levels of preoptic/anterior hypothalamic area: wakefulness>non-rapid eye movement sleep>rapid eye movement sleep."
"Levels of histamine during rapid eye movement sleep were lowest (0.245+/-0.032 pg/microl), being significantly lower than levels during non-rapid eye movement sleep (0.395+/-0.081 pg/microl) and being only 21% of wakefulness levels."
This pattern of preoptic/anterior hypothalamic area extracellular histamine levels across the sleep-wakefulness cycle closely resembles the reported single unit activity of histaminergic neurons.
"However, the invariance of histamine levels during sleep deprivation suggests that changes in histamine level do not relay information about sleep drive to the sleep-promoting neurons of the preoptic/anterior hypothalamic area."
"Both orexin and neurotensin are expressed in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) and have been implicated in the regulation of feeding, motor activity and the reward system."
A double label immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization studies showed that neurotensin colocalizes with orexin in neurons of the LHA.
Pharmacological studies suggested that neurotensin excites orexin-producing neurons (orexin neurons) through activation of neurotensin receptor-2 (NTSR-2) and non-selective cation channels.
In situ hybridization study showed that most orexin neurons express neurotensin receptor-2 mRNA but not neurotensin receptor-1 (Ntsr-1) mRNA.
Immunohistochemical studies showed that neurotensin-immunoreactive fibers make appositions to orexin neurons.
A neurotensin receptor antagonist decreased Fos expression in orexin neurons and wakefulness time in wild type mice when administered intraperitoneally.
"However, the antagonist did not evoke any effect on these parameters in orexin neuron-ablated mice."
These observations suggest the importance of neurotensin in maintaining activity of orexin neurons.
The evidence presented here expands our understanding of the regulatory mechanism of orexin neurons.
"We hypothesized that adenosine, acting via the A1 receptor, is a key factor in the homeostatic control of sleep."
The increase in extracellular levels of adenosine during prolonged wakefulness is thought to facilitate the transition to sleep by reducing the discharge activity of wakefulness-promoting neurons in the basal forebrain.
Adenosine A1 receptor control of the homeostatic regulation of sleep was tested by microdialysis perfusion of antisense oligonucleotides against the mRNA of the A1 receptor in the magnocellular cholinergic region of the basal forebrain of freely behaving rats.
"After microdialysis perfusion of A1 receptor antisense in the basal forebrain, spontaneous levels of sleep-wakefulness showed a significant reduction in non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep with an increase in wakefulness."
"After 6 hr of sleep deprivation, the antisense-treated animals spent a significantly reduced amount of time in non-REM sleep, with postdeprivation recovery sleep hours 2-5 showing a reduction of approximately 50-60%."
There was an even greater postdeprivation reduction in delta power (60-75%) and a concomitant increase in wakefulness.
All behavioral state changes returned to control (baseline) values after the cessation of antisense administration.
Control experiments with microdialysis perfusion of nonsense (randomized antisense) oligonucleotides and with artificial CSF showed no effect during postdeprivation recovery sleep or spontaneously occurring behavioral states.
Antisense to the A1 receptor suppressed A1 receptor immunoreactivity but did not show any neurotoxicity as visualized by Fluoro-Jade staining.
"These data support our hypothesis that adenosine, acting via the A1 receptor, in the basal forebrain is a key component in the homeostatic regulation of sleep."
"Biogenic amines, including acetylcholine, act as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators in the brain of mammals."
Accumulated evidences suggest the relevance of these amines to the regulatory system of sleep-wakefulness cycle.
"Recent development of an in vivo, microdialysis technique has revealed the existence of circadian variation in the release of these amines from various brain regions related to the regulation of sleep-wakefulness."
"This review focuses on the characteristics of the release of these amines determined by the microdialysis method in rats and cats during sleep-wakefulness cycle, and speculates their roles in the mechanism underlying the control of sleep and arousal state."
Daily cycles of wakefulness and sleep are regulated by coordinated interactions between wakefulness- and sleep-regulating neural circuitry.
"Wakefulness is associated with neuronal activity in cholinergic neurons in the brainstem and basal forebrain, monoaminergic neurons in the brainstem and posterior hypothalamus, and hypocretin (orexin) neurons in the lateral hypothalamus that act in a coordinated manner to stimulate cortical activation on the one hand and behavioral arousal on the other hand."
Each of these neuronal groups subserves distinct aspects of wakefulness-related functions of the brain.
Normal transitions from wakefulness to sleep involve sleep-related inhibition and/or disfacilitation of the multiple arousal systems.
"The cell groups that shut off the network of arousal systems, at sleep onset, occur with high density in the ventral lateral preoptic area (VLPO) and the median preoptic nucleus (MnPN) of the hypothalamus."
Preoptic neurons are activated during sleep and exhibit sleep-wake state-dependent discharge patterns that are reciprocal of that observed in several arousal systems.
"Neurons in the VLPO contain the inhibitory neuromodulator, galanin, and the inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)."
The majority of MnPN sleep-active neurons synthesize GABA.
VLPO and MnPN neurons are sources of projections to arousal-regulatory systems in the posterior and lateral hypothalamus and the rostral brainstem.
Mechanisms of sleep induction by these nuclei are hypothesized to involve GABA-mediated inhibition of multiple arousal systems.
Normal cycling between discrete behavioral states is mediated by the combined influence of a sleep need that increases with continued wakefulness and an intrinsic circadian oscillation.
"This chapter will review anatomical and functional properties of populations of sleep-/wake-regulating neurons, focusing on recent findings supporting functional significance of the VLPO and MnPN in the regulation of sleep--wake homeostasis."
"Evidence indicating that MnPN and VLPO neurons have different, but complementary sleep regulatory functions will be summarized."
Potential mechanisms that function to couple activity in these two sleep-regulatory neurons will be discussed.
"Narcolepsy with cataplexy is a sleep dysregulation disorder with alterations of REM sleep, i.e., sleep onset REM periods and REM sleep instability."
Deficient orexin-A (hypocretin-1) signaling is assumed to be a major cause of narcolepsy with cataplexy.
"In this study we investigated fourteen subjects with narcolepsy with cataplexy in a within-subject, random-order crossover, placebo-controlled design."
Patients received double-blinded intranasal orexin-A (435 nmol) or sterile water (placebo) in the morning.
"Administration was preceded by an adaptation night and followed by a modified maintenance of wakefulness test, attention testing and a second full night of polysomnographic recording."
We found comparable sleep behavior during the adaptation nights between both conditions.
After orexin-A administration patients had less wake-REM sleep transitions and a decreased REM sleep duration.
"In the subsequent night, patients showed an increased N2 duration."
"In the test of divided attention, patients had fewer false reactions after orexin-A administration."
Our results support orexin-A to be a REM sleep stabilizing factor and provide functional signs for effects of orexin-A on sleep alterations and attention in narcolepsy with cataplexy.
Sleep/wakefulness (S/W) disorders are frequent in Parkinson's disease (PD).
The underlying causes have yet to be elucidated but dopaminergic neurodegenerative lesions seem to contribute to appearance of the disorders and anti-Parkinsonian medication is known to accentuate S/W problems.
"Hence, we reasoned that studying the acute effect of dopaminergic compounds on S/W in an animal model of PD might improve our knowledge of S/W regulation in the context of partial dopaminergic depletion."
"To this end, we tested the effect of levodopa (l-dopa), pergolide (a mixed D(2)/D(1) agonist) and lisuride (a D(2) agonist) on S/W recordings in MPTP-treated mice, in comparison with controls."
Our results showed that dopaminergic compounds modify S/W amounts in both control and MPTP mice.
Wakefulness amounts are greater in MPTP mice after l-dopa (50 mg kg(-1)) and lisuride (1 mg kg(-1)) injections compared with control mice.
"Moreover, the paradoxical sleep latency was significantly longer in MPTP mice after high-dose l-dopa administration."
Our observations suggest that the actions of both l-dopa and lisuride on S/W differ slightly in MPTP mice relative to controls.
"Hence, MPTP-induced partial DA depletion may modulate the effect of dopaminergic compounds on S/W regulation."
"The Daily Cognitive Communicative and Sleep Profile (DCCASP) is a seven-item instrument that captures daily subjective sleep quality, perceived mood, cognitive, and communication functions."
The objective of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of the DCCASP.
"The DCCASP was self-administered daily to a convenience sample of young adults (n = 54) for two two-week blocks, interspersed with a two-week rest period."
"Afterwards, participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)."
"Internal consistency and criterion validity were calculated by Cronbach's alpha coefficient, Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC), and Spearman rank (rs) correlation coefficient, respectively."
Results indicated high internal consistency (Cronbach-s alpha = 0.864-0.938) among mean ratings of sleep quality on the DCCASP.
"There were significant correlations between mean ratings of sleep quality and all domains (rs=0.38-0.55, p<0.0001)."
"Criterion validity was established between mean sleep quality ratings on the DCCASP and PSQI (rs=0.40, p<0.001)."
"The DCCASP is a reliable and valid self-report instrument to monitor daily sleep quality and perceived mood, cognitive, and communication functions over time, amongst a normative sample of young adults."
Further studies on its psychometric properties are necessary to clarify its utility in a clinical population.
Modification of brain muscarinic cholinergic system normal functioning can be considered as an appropriate strategy for the study of its role in sleep-wakefulness cycle basic mechanisms in general and in the course/maintenance of PS in particular.
For this aim systemic application of muscarinic cholinoreceptors antagonists is significant because it gives possibility to modify functioning all of known five sub-types of muscarinic cholinoreceptors and to study the character of sleep disturbances in these conditions.
Problem is very topical because the question about the intimate aspects of BMChS involvement in PS maintaining mechanisms still remains unsolved.
"In cats Atropine systemic administration was made once daily at 10:00 a.m. and continuous EEG registration of sleep-wakefulness cycle ultradian structure, lasting for 10 hour daily, was started immediately."
In sum each animal received anti-muscarinic drugs for 12 times.
Thereafter drug administrations were ceased and EEG registration of sleep-wakefulness cycle ultradian structure was continued during 10 consecutive days.
On the basis of results obtained in these conditions we can conclude that brain muscarinic cholinergic system normal functioning is significant for basic mechanisms of sleep-wakefulness cycle.
"During wakefulness, at the level of neocortex and hippocampus, MChS supports only EEG activation, while it is one of the main factors in PS triggering and maintaining mechanisms."
The role of GABA in medial preoptico-anterior hypothalamic area in the regulation of spontaneous sleep-wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep was investigated in this study.
"Local microinjection of picrotoxin, a GABA-A antagonist, into this area increased quiet wakefulness but significantly reduced deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep."
Both the frequency of generation and duration per episode of the latter were significantly reduced.
It is concluded that GABA-ergic neurotransmission in the medial preoptic area is spontaneously active in modulating the hypnogenic function including rapid eye movement sleep and the action is mediated by GABA-A receptor.
Hypothalamic neurons that contain the neuropeptide orexin (hypocretin) play important roles in the regulation of sleep/wake.
Here we analyze the in vivo and in vitro phenotype of mice lacking the GABA(B1) gene specifically in orexin neurons (oxGKO mice) and demonstrate that GABA(B) receptors on orexin neurons are essential in stabilizing and consolidating sleep/wake states.
"In oxGKO brain slices, we show that the absence of GABA(B) receptors decreases the sensitivity of orexin neurons to both excitatory and inhibitory inputs because of augmented GABA(A)-mediated inhibition that increases the membrane conductance and shunts postsynaptic currents in these neurons."
This increase in GABA(A)-mediated inhibitory tone is apparently the result of an orexin receptor type 1-mediated activation of local GABAergic interneurons that project back onto orexin neurons.
"oxGKO mice exhibit severe fragmentation of sleep/wake states during both the light and dark periods, without showing an abnormality in total sleep time or signs of cataplexy."
"Thus, GABA(B) receptors on orexin neurons are crucial in the appropriate control of the orexinergic tone through sleep/wake states, thereby stabilizing the state switching mechanisms."
"This study was undertaken to assess the role of catecholamine fibers, terminating in the preoptic area, in regulating sleep-wakefulness in rats."
"Sleep-wakefulness was assessed on the basis of 24h electroencephalogram, electromyogram and electro-oculogram recordings before and after destruction of catecholaminergic terminals at the medial preoptic area by bilateral intracerebral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (8 microg in 0.2 microl)."
There was a mild reduction in sleep and increase in wakefulness after the lesion.
The increase in active wakefulness observed after eight days of lesion persisted even on the 12th day.
"In spite of the reduction in sleep, the day-night sleep ratio was not affected by 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the preoptic area."
The results indicate that the noradrenergic fibers at the preoptic area have a hypnogenic role.
