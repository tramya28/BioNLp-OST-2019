BACKGROUND: Research suggests that interaction between humans and digital environments characterizes a form of companionship in addition to technical convenience.,0
To this effect humans have attempted to design computer systems able to demonstrably empathize with the human affective experience.,0
Facial electromyography (EMG) is one such technique enabling machines to access to human affective states.,0
Numerous studies have investigated the effects of valence emotions on facial EMG activity captured over the corrugator supercilii (frowning muscle) and zygomaticus major (smiling muscle).,0
The arousal emotion specifically has not received much research attention however.,0
In the present study we sought to identify intensive valence and arousal affective states via facial EMG activity.,1
METHODS: Ten blocks of affective pictures were separated into five categories: neutral valence/low arousal (0VLA) positive valence/high arousal (PVHA) negative valence/high arousal (NVHA) positive valence/low arousal (PVLA) and negative valence/low arousal (NVLA) and the ability of each to elicit corresponding valence and arousal affective states was investigated at length.,0
One hundred and thirteen participants were subjected to these stimuli and provided facial EMG.,0
A set of 16 features based on the amplitude frequency predictability and variability of signals was defined and classified using a support vector machine (SVM).,0
RESULTS: We observed highly accurate classification rates based on the combined corrugator and zygomaticus EMG ranging from 75.69% to 100.00% for the baseline and five affective states (0VLA PVHA PVLA NVHA and NVLA) in all individuals.,0
There were significant differences in classification rate accuracy between senior and young adults but there was no significant difference between female and male participants.,0
CONCLUSION: Our research provides robust evidences for recognition of intensive valence and arousal affective states in young and senior adults.,0
These findings contribute to the successful future application of facial EMG for identifying user affective states in human machine interaction (HMI) or companion robotic systems (CRS).,0
BACKGROUND: Substantial evidence shows that physical activities of daily living are positively correlated with affective states in middle-aged and older adults.,1
However people's physical activity decreases when they grow older and conditions that enhance older individuals' physical activities of daily living are not well understood.,0
PURPOSE: This study investigated need satisfaction (competence relatedness and autonomy) and its moderating effect on the within-subject relation between physical activities of daily living and three dimensions of affective states (valence energetic arousal and calmness) based on an ambulatory assessment that used activity-triggered e-diaries.,1
METHOD: The physical activities of daily living of 68 adults aged 50+ (mean age = 60.1 +/- 7.1) were measured objectively for three consecutive days and need satisfaction and affective states were assessed as a function of the amount of physical activity during the preceding 10 min before the affect measurement (in activity-triggered e-diaries).,0
Hierarchical multilevel analyses were performed.,0
RESULTS: Need satisfaction was significantly and positively correlated with the three dimensions of affective states.,0
Further physical activities of daily living were significantly associated with energetic arousal and calmness but not valence.,1
However when physical activities of daily living were more autonomously regulated the association of physical activities of daily living and valence became significant and positive.,0
CONCLUSION: The findings regarding the significant moderating effects of need satisfaction are crucial for interventions aiming to improve the health-enhancing effects of physical activity in adults aged 50+.,0
Positive feelings owing to physical activities in daily living depend on the extent that psychological needs are satisfied.,0
Despite the well-documented positive effect of exercise on health outcomes most people do not succeed in exercising regularly.,0
In addition to several other influences affective states seem to support exercise participation.,0
Associations between exercise and affect have been shown in the laboratory.,0
However the dynamic relation between affect and exercise in daily life is not yet well-understood.,0
The objective of this study was to investigate the bi-directional effect of momentary affective states on naturally occurring exercise and vice versa in healthy participants in real-life environments by applying an ecological momentary assessment design.,1
We hypothesized that (1) exercise duration is positively associated with affective states on a day level (2) affective states in the morning predict subsequent exercise duration and (3) exercise duration predicts affective states in the evening on that respective day.,0
Data from N = 60 students aged between 19 and 32 years were analyzed.,0
Affect and exercise duration were assessed daily over a period of 20 days via an electronic diary.,0
Multilevel analysis revealed that positive affective valence was positively associated with exercise duration (p = 0.003) on a day level.,0
In addition the more the participants exercised that respective day the better and more content they felt in the evening (p = 0.009).,0
Energetic arousal in the morning significantly predicted subsequent exercise duration (p = 0.045).,0
The findings indicate that it would be worthwhile to focus more on within-subject analyses when analyzing the dynamic relation between affect and exercise.,0
Furthermore affective states should be taken into account in creating effective interventions to foster exercise behavior and enhance maintenance.,1
From direct observations facial vocal gestural physiological and central nervous signals estimating human affective states through computational models such as multivariate linear-regression analysis support vector regression and artificial neural network have been proposed in the past decade.,0
In these models linear models are generally lack of precision because of ignoring intrinsic nonlinearities of complex psychophysiological processes; and nonlinear models commonly adopt complicated algorithms.,0
To improve accuracy and simplify model we introduce a new computational modeling method named as higher-order multivariable polynomial regression to estimate human affective states.,1
The study employs standardized pictures in the International Affective Picture System to induce thirty subjects' affective states and obtains pure affective patterns of skin conductance as input variables to the higher-order multivariable polynomial model for predicting affective valence and arousal.,0
Experimental results show that our method is able to obtain efficient correlation coefficients of 0.98 and 0.96 for estimation of affective valence and arousal respectively.,0
Moreover the method may provide certain indirect evidences that valence and arousal have their brain's motivational circuit origins.,0
Thus the proposed method can serve as a novel one for efficiently estimating human affective states.,0
This study examined a two-dimensional approach to assessing affective states among good and poor sleepers using the self-assessment manikin (SAM) a brief non-verbal self-report measure of affective states with separate ratings of valence and arousal.,1
A sample of 286 undergraduate students completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the SAM.,0
Participants were classified post hoc as either good (PSQI </= 5) or poor sleepers (PSQI > 5) using the PSQI and used the SAM to rate their current affective states (day) and their affective state at bedtime (night) the previous night.,0
Compared to good sleepers poor sleepers reported more negative affect and arousal at night and more negative affect during the day.,0
Among poor sleepers lower sleep quality and shorter sleep duration on the components of the PSQI were associated with more negative daytime valence.,0
Among good sleepers higher scores on the sleep medication and daytime dysfunction components of the PSQI were associated with more negative daytime valence.,0
These findings indicate that the SAM appears to detect differences between good and poor sleepers on both valence and arousal of current daytime and retrospective night-time emotional states.,1
This approach could be useful for the assessment of affective states related to sleep disturbance.,0
Regularly conducted exercise programs effectively influence affective states.,0
Studies suggest that this is also true for short bouts of physical activity (PA) of 10 min or less.,0
Accordingly everyday life activities of short duration might be used to regulate affective states.,1
However this association has rarely been studied in reference to unstructured activities in ongoing real-life situations.,0
The current study examined the influence of various everyday life activities on three dimensions of mood (valence calmness energetic arousal) in a predominantly inactive sample.,1
Ambulatory Assessment (AA) was used to investigate the association between actual PA and affective states during the course of 1 day.,0
Seventy-seven students ages 19-30 participated in the study.,0
PA was assessed with accelerometers and affective state assessments were conducted hourly using an e-diary with a six-item mood scale that was specially designed for AA.,0
Multilevel analyses indicated that the mood dimensions energetic arousal (p = 0.001) and valence (p = 0.005) were positively influenced by the intensity of the activity carried out in the 10-min prior to the assessment.,0
As their activity increased the participants' positive feelings and energetic arousal increased.,0
However the students' calmness was not affected by their activity levels.,0
The findings highlight the importance of integrating short activity intervals of 10 min or less into everyday life routines to improve affective states.,0
Friedman and Forster (2010) reviewed an extensive program of research that was consistent with the view that positive affective states broaden whereas negative affective states narrow the scope of attention.,0
We applaud their creative investigations into these important psychological questions and appreciate their thorough review.,0
However recent evidence strongly suggests that the conclusions drawn by Friedman and Forster need to be tempered for the recent evidence suggests that motivational intensity rather than affective valence causes the modulations of attentional tuning.,0
That is affective states of low motivational intensity (e.g. sadness postgoal positive affect) broaden attention whereas affective states of high motivational intensity (e.g. disgust pregoal positive affect) narrow attention.,1
Our viewpoint is that attentional narrowing occurs during affective states of high motivational intensity to aid organisms in acquiring desirable objects and avoiding aversive ones.,1
Attentional broadening occurs during affective states of low motivational intensity to open organisms to new opportunities.,1
Background: Although people generally feel more positive and more energetic in the aftermath of exercise than before longitudinal research on how exercise relates to within-person fluctuations in affect over the course of everyday life is still relatively limited.,0
One constraint on doing such research is the need to provide participants with accelerometers to objectively record their exercise and pagers to capture affective reports.,0
Aims: We aimed to develop a methodology for studying affect and exercise using only technology that participants already possess namely GPS running watches and smartphones.,0
Using this methodology we aimed to characterize within-individual fluctuations in affective valence and arousal in relation to bouts of exercise and explore possible moderators of these fluctuations.,1
Methods: We recruited a sample of 38 recreational runners.,0
Participants provided daily affective reports for six weeks using their smartphones.,0
Information on their runs was harvested from their own GPS devices via an online platform for athletes.,0
Results: Average valence and arousal were higher on days when the person had run than on the next day and higher the day after a run than on the days after that.,0
Over the course of the day of a run valence and arousal declined significantly as the time since the run increased.,0
Physically fitter participants had more positive valence overall and this was particularly true when they had not run recently.,0
There was some evidence of higher-dose (i.e. longer and faster) runs being associated with lower arousal on the next and subsequent days.,0
Gender did not moderate associations between running and valence or arousal.,0
Discussion: Our study demonstrated the potential for studying the associations between affect and exercise in a way that is precise undemanding for participants and convenient for researchers using technologies that participants already own and use.,1
BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that older adults show positive affects after participating in exercise bouts.,0
However it is less clear if and how physical activities in daily living enhance affective states too.,0
This is dissatisfying as most of older adults' physical activities are part of their daily living.,0
To answer these questions we used activity-triggered e-diaries to investigate the within-subject effects of physical activity on three dimensions of affective states (valence energetic arousal calmness) during everyday life.,1
METHODS: Older adults (N = 74) between 50 and 70 years took part in the study during three consecutive days.,0
Physical activity in daily living was objectively assessed using accelerometers.,0
Affects were measured 10 min after a study participant surpassed a predefined threshold for activity or inactivity.,0
The participants were prompted by an acoustic signal to assess their momentary affective states on an e-diary.,0
Data were analyzed with hierarchical multilevel analyses.,0
RESULTS: Whenever older individuals were more physically active they felt more energized (energetic arousal) and agitated (calmness).,0
However they did not feel better (valence).,0
Interestingly body mass index (BMI) and valence were associated in a significant cross-level interaction.,0
BMI acts as a moderating variable in the way that lower BMI scores were associated with higher levels of valence scores after being physically active.,0
CONCLUSIONS: The innovative ambulatory assessment used here affords an interesting insight to the affective effects of daily activity of older adults.,0
These effects are no simple and no linear ones i.e.,0
physical activity is not associated with positive affects per se as shown several times in experimental studies with single activity bouts.,0
Rather there is a differentiating association seen as an enhanced feeling of energy and agitation which is not accompanied by a better feeling.,0
Socio-emotional selectivity theory may support the finding that older individuals are emotionally more stable during their day-to-day life which might explain the non-significant effect on the affect dimension valence.,1
Multiple studies suggest that physical activity causes positive affective reactions and reduces depressive mood.,0
However studies and interventions focused mostly on structured activity programs but rarely on actual physical activity (aPA) in daily life.,0
Furthermore they seldom account for the context in which the aPA occur (e.g. work leisure).,0
Using a prospective real-time assessment design (ambulatory assessment) we investigated the effects of aPA on affective states (valence energetic arousal calmness) in real-time during everyday life while controlling for the context.,1
Eighty-seven undergraduates students (Age: M = 24.6; SD = 3.2 females: 54%) participated in this study.,0
aPA was assessed through accelerometers during 24-h. Palmtop devices prompted subjects approximately every 45 min during a 14-h daytime period to assess their affective states and the context.,0
We analyzed within- and between-person effects with hierarchical modeling (HLM 6.0).,0
Multilevel analyses revealed that both aPA and context influenced subsequent affective states.,0
The interaction of aPA and context did predict energetic arousal only.,0
State levels of affects did not differ between men and women.,0
For both men and women aPA in everyday life has an effect on individual's affective states.,0
For valence and calmness it seems to be independent of the context in which the aPA occur.,0
For energetic arousal men reported to have lower feelings of energy and women reported to have more feelings of energy during leisure time compared to working episodes.,1
Several interventions aiming to enhance physical activity in everyday life showed mixed effects.,0
Affective constructs are thought to potentially support health behavior change.,0
However little is known about within-subject associations between momentary affect and subsequent physical activity in everyday life.,0
This study analyzed the extent to which three dimensions of affective states (valence calmness and energetic arousal) were associated with different components of daily activity trajectories.,1
Sixty-five undergraduates' students (Age: M = 24.6; SD = 3.2; females: 57%) participated in this study.,0
Physical activity was assessed objectively through accelerometers during 24 h. Affective states assessments were conducted randomly every 45 min using an e-diary with a six-item mood scale that was especially designed for ambulatory assessment.,0
We conducted three-level multi-level analyses to investigate the extent to which momentary affect accounted for momentary volume prospective trends and stability vs. fluctuation of physical activity in everyday life.,0
All three affect dimensions were significantly associated with momentary activity volumes and prospective trends over 45 min periods.,0
Physical activity didn't fluctuate freely but featured significant autocorrelation across repeated measurements suggesting some stability of physical activity across 5-min assessments.,0
After adjusting for the autoregressive structure in physical activity assessments only energetic arousal remained a significant predictor.,0
Feeling energized and awake was associated with an increased momentary volume of activity and initially smaller but gradually growing decreases in subsequent activity within the subsequent 45 min.,0
Although not related to trends in physical activity higher valence predicted lower stability in physical activity across subsequent 45 min suggesting more short-term fluctuations in daily activity the more participants reported positive affective valence.,0
The current analyses afford interesting insight into within-subject associations between momentary affect and activity-trajectories in everyday life.,0
Energetic arousal emerged as the only meaningful predictor of physical activity in daily life after adjusting for autoregression.,0
A significant effect of valence on short-term activity fluctuations might indicate that activity interventions would benefit from taking into account enhancement of positive affective valence in everyday life.,1
Moments of enhanced valence may scaffold attempts helping inactive people to get started with daily activities and overcome periods of inactivity in everyday life.,0
Brain activity was monitored while participants viewed picture sets that reflected high or low levels of arousal and positive neutral or negative valence.,0
Pictures within a set were presented rapidly in an incidental viewing task while fMRI data were collected.,0
The primary purpose of the study was to determine if multi-voxel pattern analysis could be used within and between participants to predict valence arousal and combined affective states elicited by pictures based on distributed patterns of whole brain activity.,1
A secondary purpose was to determine if distributed patterns of whole brain activity can be used to derive a lower dimensional representation of affective states consistent with behavioral data.,0
Results demonstrated above chance prediction of valence arousal and affective states that was robust across a wide range of number of voxels used in prediction.,0
Additionally individual differences multidimensional scaling based on fMRI data clearly separated valence and arousal levels and was consistent with a circumplex model of affective states.,1
BACKGROUND: Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are a valuable research model because of their behavioral physiological and neuroanatomical similarities to humans.,0
In the absence of language autonomic activity can provide crucial information about cognitive and affective states during single-unit recording inactivation and lesion studies.,1
Methods standardized for use in humans are not easily adapted to NHPs and detailed guidance has been lacking.,0
NEW METHOD: We provide guidance for monitoring heart rate and pupil size in the behavioral neurophysiology setting by addressing the methodological issues pitfalls and solutions for NHP studies.,0
The methods are based on comparative physiology to establish a rationale for each solution.,0
We include examples from both electrophysiological and lesion studies.,0
RESULTS: Single-unit recording pupil responses and heart rate changes represent a range of decreasing temporal resolution a characteristic that impacts experimental design and analysis.,0
We demonstrate the unexpected result that autonomic measures acquired before and after amygdala lesions are comparable despite disruption of normal autonomic function.,0
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Species and study design differences can render standard techniques used in human studies inappropriate for NHP studies.,0
We show how to manage data from small groups typical of NHP studies data from the short behavioral trials typical of neurophysiological studies issues associated with longitudinal studies and differences in anatomy and physiology.,0
CONCLUSIONS: Autonomic measurement to infer cognitive and affective states in NHP is neither off-the-shelf nor onerous.,0
Familiarity with the issues and solutions will broaden the use of autonomic signals in NHP single unit and lesion studies.,0
Whether emotion is universal or social is a recurrent issue in the history of emotion study among psychologists.,0
Some researchers view emotion as a universal construct and that a large part of emotional experience is biologically based.,0
However emotion is not only biologically determined but is also influenced by the environment.,0
Therefore cultural differences exist in some aspects of emotions one such important aspect of emotion being emotional arousal level.,1
All affective states are systematically represented as two bipolar dimensions valence and arousal.,0
Arousal level of actual and ideal emotions has consistently been found to have cross-cultural differences.,0
In Western or individualist culture high arousal emotions are valued and promoted more than low arousal emotions.,0
Moreover Westerners experience high arousal emotions more than low arousal emotions.,1
By contrast in Eastern or collectivist culture low arousal emotions are valued more than high arousal emotions.,0
Moreover people in the East actually experience and prefer to experience low arousal emotions more than high arousal emotions.,1
Mechanism of these cross-cultural differences and implications are also discussed.,0
Compared to standard laboratory protocols the measurement of psychophysiological signals in real world experiments poses technical and methodological challenges due to external factors that cannot be directly controlled.,0
To address this problem we propose a hybrid approach based on an immersive and human accessible space called the eXperience Induction Machine (XIM) that incorporates the advantages of a laboratory within a life-like setting.,0
The XIM integrates unobtrusive wearable sensors for the acquisition of psychophysiological signals suitable for ambulatory emotion research.,0
In this paper we present results from two different studies conducted to validate the XIM as a general-purpose sensing infrastructure for the study of human affective states under ecologically valid conditions.,1
In the first investigation we recorded and classified signals from subjects exposed to pictorial stimuli corresponding to a range of arousal levels while they were free to walk and gesticulate.,1
In the second study we designed an experiment that follows the classical conditioning paradigm a well-known procedure in the behavioral sciences with the additional feature that participants were free to move in the physical space as opposed to similar studies measuring physiological signals in constrained laboratory settings.,0
Our results indicate that by using our sensing infrastructure it is indeed possible to infer human event-elicited affective states through measurements of psychophysiological signals under ecological conditions.,1
Previous findings suggest that visual working memory (VWM) preferentially remembers angry looking faces.,0
However the meaning of facial actions is construed in relation to context.,0
To date there are no studies investigating the role of perceiver-based context when processing emotional cues in VWM.,0
To explore the influence of affective context on VWM for faces we conducted two experiments using both a VWM task for emotionally expressive faces and a mood induction procedure.,1
Affective context was manipulated by unpleasant (Experiment 1) and pleasant (Experiment 2) IAPS pictures in order to induce an affect high in motivational intensity (defensive or appetitive respectively) compared to a low arousal control condition.,0
Results indicated specifically increased sensitivity of VWM for angry looking faces in the neutral condition.,0
Enhanced VWM for angry faces was prevented by inducing affects of high motivational intensity.,0
In both experiments affective states led to a switch from specific enhancement of angry expressions in VWM to an equally sensitive representation of all emotional expressions.,1
Our findings demonstrate that emotional expressions are of different behavioral relevance for the receiver depending on the affective context supporting a functional organization of VWM along with flexible resource allocation.,0
In VWM stimulus processing adjusts to situational requirements and transitions from a specifically prioritizing default mode in predictable environments to a sensitive hypervigilant mode in exposure to emotional events.,0
Animal training relies heavily on an understanding of species-specific behaviour as it integrates with operant conditioning principles.,0
Following on from recent studies showing that affective states and arousal levels may correlate with behavioural outcomes we explore the contribution of both affective state and arousal in behavioural responses to operant conditioning.,1
This paper provides a framework for assessing how affective state and arousal may influence the efficacy of operant training methods.,0
It provides a series of three-dimensional conceptual graphs as exemplars to describing putative influences of both affective state and arousal on the likelihood of dogs and horses performing commonly desired behaviours.,0
These graphs are referred to as response landscapes and they highlight the flexibility available for improving training efficacy and the likely need for different approaches to suit animals in different affective states and at various levels of arousal.,1
Knowledge gaps are discussed and suggestions made for bridging them.,0
Human emotion recognition (HER) allows the assessment of an affective state of a subject.,0
Until recently such emotional states were described in terms of discrete emotions like happiness or contempt.,0
In order to cover a high range of emotions researchers in the field have introduced different dimensional spaces for emotion description that allow the characterization of affective states in terms of several variables or dimensions that measure distinct aspects of the emotion.,1
One of the most common of such dimensional spaces is the bidimensional Arousal/Valence space.,1
To the best of our knowledge all HER systems so far have modelled independently the dimensions in these dimensional spaces.,0
In this paper we study the effect of modelling the output dimensions simultaneously and show experimentally the advantages in modeling them in this way.,0
We consider a multimodal approach by including features from the Electroencephalogram and a few physiological signals.,0
For modelling the multiple outputs we employ a multiple output regressor based on support vector machines.,0
We also include an stage of feature selection that is developed within an embedded approach known as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) proposed initially for SVM.,0
The results show that several features can be eliminated using the multiple output support vector regressor with RFE without affecting the performance of the regressor.,0
From the analysis of the features selected in smaller subsets via RFE it can be observed that the signals that are more informative into the arousal and valence space discrimination are the EEG Electrooculogram/Electromiogram (EOG/EMG) and the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR).,1
INTRODUCTION: Persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) is a relatively unknown clinical condition affecting several women.,0
Moral standards as well as conservative beliefs regarding sexuality are believed to be involved in the etiology and maintenance of this syndrome.,0
Nevertheless there are no consistent data on the content of the beliefs system presented by these women.,0
AIM: The aim of this study was to characterize the cognitive and emotional style of women reporting PGAD.,1
More precisely the content of sexual beliefs thoughts and emotions during sexual intercourse was explored.,0
METHODS: Forty-three women presenting PGAD and 42 controls responded to a web survey.,0
This study was cross-cultural in nature and women worldwide (over 18 years old) were asked to participate.,0
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants answered the following online questionnaires: Sexual Dysfunctional Beliefs Questionnaire Sexual Modes Questionnaire Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and Brief Symptom Inventory.,0
Additionally participants responded to a checklist assessing the presence and frequency of PGAD symptoms.,0
RESULTS: After controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and psychopathology findings showed that women reporting PGAD symptoms presented significantly more dysfunctional sexual beliefs (e.g. sexual conservatism sexual desire as a sin) as well as more negative thoughts (e.g. thoughts of sexual abuse and of lack of partner's affection) and dysfunctional affective states (more negative and less positive affect) during sexual activity than non-PGAD women.,0
CONCLUSIONS: Notwithstanding the impact of neurophysiological determinants in the etiology of this syndrome results support the psychological conceptualization of PGAD and highlight the role of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for PGAD symptomatology.,0
More specifically cognitive and behavioral strategies would be aimed at targeting maladaptive sexual beliefs and thoughts as well as regulating negative affective states resulting from a dysfunctional cognitive style regarding sexuality.,1
In all CBT in association with a medical/pharmacological approach could be clinically relevant in the management of PGAD.,0
In this paper time frequency and time-frequency features derived from thermal infrared data are used to discriminate between self-reported affective states of an individual in response to visual stimuli drawn from the International Affective Pictures System.,0
A total of six binary classification tasks were examined to distinguish baseline and affect states.,1
Affect states were determined from subject-reported levels of arousal and valence.,1
Mean adjusted accuracies of 70% to 80% were achieved for the baseline classifications tasks.,0
Classification accuracies between high and low ratings of arousal and valence were between 50% and 60% respectively.,0
Our analysis showed that facial thermal infrared imaging data of baseline and other affective states may be separable.,0
The results of this study suggest that classification of facial thermal infrared imaging data coupled with affect models can be used to provide information about an individual's affective state for potential use as a passive communication pathway.,1
Emotions are predicted to influence judgement and decision-making across a range of performance contexts.,0
This experiment tested whether motivational-general arousal imagery can improve the decision-making performance of elite endurance cyclists.,1
In total 54 cyclists (38 men 16 women) were assigned to either a positive imagery condition (where positive images associated with the affective experience of winning were encouraged) or a negative imagery condition (where negative images associated with poor performance were encouraged).,0
The cyclists were read one of two scripts designed to elicit positive or negative images during a 20-min maximal sustainable interval on a cycle ergometer.,0
A decision-making task (colour-word match Stroop) was performed before and immediately after the maximal sustainable power interval.,0
Results showed that the manipulation was successful with cyclists in the positive imagery condition reporting more positive affective states (higher levels of happiness and lower levels of dejection) than those in the negative imagery condition.,1
However there was no significant difference between the two groups in their decision-making performance under physiological duress.,0
These findings indicate that while motivational-general arousal imagery might be a useful method to induce positive emotions during exercise it is unlikely to improve the decision-making performance of cyclists in performance-relevant conditions.,0
BACKGROUND: Based on introspectionist semantic and psychophysiological experimental frameworks it has long been assumed that all affective states derive from two independent basic dimensions valence and arousal.,0
However until now no study has investigated whether valence and arousal are also dissociable at the level of affect-related changes in cognitive processing.,1
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined how changes in both valence (negative vs. positive) and arousal (low vs. high) influence performance in tasks requiring executive control because recent research indicates that two dissociable cognitive components are involved in the regulation of task performance: amount of current control (i.e. strength of filtering goal-irrelevant signals) and control adaptation (i.e. strength of maintaining current goals over time).,1
Using a visual pop-out distractor task we found that control is exclusively modulated by arousal because interference by goal-irrelevant signals was largest in high arousal states independently of valence.,0
By contrast control adaptation is exclusively modulated by valence because the increase in control after trials in which goal-irrelevant signals were present was largest in negative states independent of arousal.,0
A Monte Carlo simulation revealed that differential effects of two experimental factors on control and control adaptation can be dissociated if there is no correlation between empirical interference and conflict-driven modulation of interference which was the case in the present data.,0
Consequently the observed effects of valence and arousal on adaptive executive control are indeed dissociable.,0
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicate that affective influences on cognitive processes can be driven by independent effects of variations in valence and arousal which may resolve several heterogeneous findings observed in previous studies on affect-cognition interactions.,1
Insight into the emotional lives of animals is of utmost importance to the welfare of the billions of animals in our care yet little is known about how to measure these states.,0
Scientific understanding of how to measure and interpret positive emotional states is particularly lacking although recent years have seen a notable increase in such studies.,0
This study explored whether the percentage of visible eye whites is a valid measure of a low arousal positive emotional state in dairy cows (Bos taurus) by using stroking as the positive stimulus.,1
Thirteen dairy cows were studied over a period of two months and a total of 372 full 15minute focal observations were performed.,0
Each focal observation comprised three 5minute phases: pre-stroking (baseline) stroking (stimulus) and post-stroking (post-stimulus) and the focal cow's behaviours were recorded throughout each observation and the focal eye was filmed for later analysis.,0
Following data collection we calculated the percentage of visible eye white at nine pre-determined measurement points throughout each focal observation.,0
The eye white data were analysed using the one-way repeated measures ANOVA test.,0
The percentage of visible eye white dropped during stroking compared with during both the pre-stroking and post-stroking phases (ANOVA: F1.242 14.9=4.32 P=0.025).,0
The behaviours were analysed using Friedman's ANOVA and Wilcoxon's signed-rank test.,0
Behaviours known to be associated with positive emotions in cows were performed during the stroking phase of the focal observation supporting the use of stroking as a stimulus to induce a positive low arousal emotional state.,1
This study has explored the potential of visible eye whites as a measure of positive emotions and arousal and our results support previous studies which suggest that eye whites may serve as a dynamic measure of emotion and arousal.,0
Mothers and their babies represent one of the closest dyadic units and thus provide a powerful paradigm to examine how affective states are shared and result in synchronized physiologic responses between two people.,0
We recruited mothers and their 12- to 14-month-old infants (Ndyads = 98) to complete a lab study in which mothers were initially separated from their infants and assigned to either a low-arousal positive/relaxation condition intended to elicit parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) reactivity or a high-arousal negative/stress task intended to elicit sympathetic nervous system (SNS) reactivity.,1
Upon reunion infants were placed either on their mothers' laps (touch condition) or in a high chair next to the mother (no-touch condition).,0
We then examined if the babies SNS and/or PNS responses changed from their baseline levels and how the dyads' physiological responses-both PNS and SNS responses-synchronized over time as a function of mothers' affect manipulation and touch condition.,0
Three noteworthy findings were observed.,0
First infants of mothers assigned to the relaxation task showed greater PNS increases and PNS covariation.,0
Second infants of mothers assigned to the stress task showed stronger SNS covariation with their mothers over time.,0
Finally infants who sat on their mothers' laps (i.e. touch condition) showed stronger SNS covariation than those in the no-touch condition.,0
Taken together these results suggest that mothers' affective states-low-arousal positive states as well as high-arousal negative states-can be caught by their infants and that touch can play a critical role in stress contagion.,0
(PsycINFO Database Record,0
Although it is possible to observe when another person is having an emotional moment we also derive information about the affective states of others from what they tell us they are feeling.,0
In an effort to distill the complexity of affective experience psychologists routinely focus on a simplified subset of subjective rating scales (i.e. dimensions) that capture considerable variability in reported affect: reported valence (i.e. how good or bad?),1
and reported arousal (e.g. how strong is the emotion you are feeling?).,0
Still existing theoretical approaches address the basic organization and measurement of these affective dimensions differently.,0
Some approaches organize affect around the dimensions of bipolar valence and arousal (e.g. the circumplex model) whereas alternative approaches organize affect around the dimensions of unipolar positivity and unipolar negativity (e.g. the bivariate evaluative model).,0
In this report we (a) replicate the data structure observed when collected according to the two approaches described above and reinterpret these data to suggest that the relationship between each pair of affective dimensions is conditional on valence ambiguity and (b) formalize this structure with a mathematical model depicting a valence ambiguity dimension that decreases in range as arousal decreases (a triangle).,0
This model captures variability in affective ratings better than alternative approaches increasing variance explained from ~60% to over 90% without adding parameters.,1
It has been suggested that high arousal negative affective states but not low arousal negative affective states potentiate the startle response.,0
Because sadness has generally been studied as a low arousal emotion it remains unclear whether high arousal sadness would produce startle potentiation to a similar degree as high arousal fear.,1
To address this issue 32 participants viewed two sets of 10-min film clips selected to induce two affective states of high subjective arousal (fear sadness) and a neutral state of low subjective arousal while the eyeblink startle response associated with brief noise bursts was assessed using orbicularis oculi EMG.,0
Larger blink magnitude was found for fearful than for sad or neutral clips.,1
Implications for conceptualizing sadness are discussed.,0
Recent research has demonstrated that affective states elicited by viewing pictures varying in valence and arousal are identifiable from whole brain activation patterns observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).,0
Identification of affective states from more naturalistic stimuli has clinical relevance but the feasibility of identifying these states on an individual trial basis from fMRI data elicited by dynamic multimodal stimuli is unclear.,1
The goal of this study was to determine whether affective states can be similarly identified when participants view dynamic naturalistic audiovisual stimuli.,1
Eleven participants viewed 5s audiovisual clips in a passive viewing task in the scanner.,0
Valence and arousal for individual trials were identified both within and across participants based on distributed patterns of activity in areas selectively responsive to audiovisual naturalistic stimuli while controlling for lower level features of the stimuli.,0
In addition the brain regions identified by searchlight analyses to represent valence and arousal were consistent with previously identified regions associated with emotion processing.,1
These findings extend previous results on the distributed representation of affect to multimodal dynamic stimuli.,0
Introduction: Most adolescent smokers report a desire to quit and many have made several unsuccessful quit attempts; however when adolescents attempt to quit they often resume smoking quickly.,0
This ecological study aimed to (1) characterize affective and situational precipitants of smoking lapses among adolescents and (2) explore the moderating influence of nicotine dependence severity on lapse precipitants.,0
Methods: Adolescent daily smokers (n=166; ages 14-18 years) completed electronic diaries of cigarettes smoked craving and affective states and situational variables on handheld computers in their natural environment for two weeks following an unassisted quit attempt.,0
On average adolescents were moderately nicotine dependent (Modified Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire [mFTQ] score=4.9; SD=1.6).,0
Results: Craving was a significant episodic cue for lapse and stable influence on lapse relating to 44% and 15% increased odds of lapse respectively.,0
High-arousal affective states-regardless of valence-were associated with 12-13% increased odds of lapse.,0
Low-arousal positive affective states were associated with 17% decreased odds of lapse.,0
A 1-unit difference in a teen's mFTQ score related to 27% increased odds of lapse but dependence severity did not moderate proximal lapse influences.,0
Conclusions: This report provides some of the first ecological data characterizing adolescent smoking lapses following a quit attempt.,0
As in prior work with teens lapses were nearly universal and quickly followed the quit attempt.,0
Specific situational and affective contexts of smoking lapses for adolescents were implicated indicating the need for cessation interventions to address craving and high-arousal affective states as precipitators of lapse in this high-risk group.,1
Implications: This report provides some of the first ecological data characterizing smoking lapses among teens attempting to quit smoking on their own.,0
Like adults adolescents face many barriers when making quit attempts.,0
The present work provides ecological data to suggest that the experience of heightened arousal in teens' daily lives interferes with their efforts to quit smoking.,0
Thus this work highlights the importance of affective dysregulation or amplitude of emotional feelings for teen smoking lapses.,1
Moment-to-moment fluctuation in craving was also implicated as a dynamic precipitator of smoking lapse in this high-risk group.,0
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to verify psychometric properties of the Polish version of the Job-related Affective Well-being Scale (JAWS).,0
Specifically theoretical 4-factor structure (based on the dimensions of pleasure and arousal) and reliability of the original - 20-item JAWS (van Katwyk et al. 2000) and the shortened - 12-item (Schaufeli and Van Rhenen 2006) versions were tested.,0
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two independent samples were analyzed (police officers N = 395 and police recruits N = 202).,0
The Polish version of the original 20-item JAWS was used to measure job-related affective states across the past month (van Katwyk et al. 2000).,0
This version of JAWS includes 2 dimensions: valence and arousal which allow to assess 4 categories of emotions: low-arousal positive emotions high-arousal positive emotions low-arousal negative emotions and high-arousal negative emotions.,1
RESULTS: The results of multidimensional scaling analysis showed that the theoretical circumplex model of emotions underlining JAWS was satisfactorily reproduced.,0
Also the hypothesized 4-factor structure of the Polish version of JAWS was confirmed.,0
The 12-item version had better fit with the data than the original 20-item version but the best fit was obtained for the even shorter 8-item version.,0
This version emerged from a multidimensional scaling of the 12-item version.,0
Reliabilities of the 20- and 12-item versions were good with lower values for the 8-item JAWS version.,0
CONCLUSIONS: The findings confirmed satisfactory psychometric properties of both Polish versions of the Job-related Affective Well-being Scale.,1
Thus when both psychometric properties and relevance for cross-cultural comparisons are considered the 12-item JAWS is recommended as a version of choice.,0
Evidence that structured physical activity can help to regulate affective state has spurred interest in identifying associations between unstructured physical activity and affective states during daily life.,0
The present study examined whether stressful daily life situations that elicit affective arousal also elicit increased physical activity in the form of restless movement.,1
The study compared the physical activity of professors (n = 25) after presenting a classroom lecture to their physical activity at the same time of day on a non-lecture workday.,0
The expectation was that lecturing would increase affective arousal leading to greater restless movement following the lecture compared to the non-lecture control day.,0
The study assessed subjective arousal to confirm that arousal was higher during the lecture.,0
The primary outcome measures were actigraphy-measured standing and stepping times and number of steps and posture transitions.,0
Results indicate that energetic and tense arousal were higher during the lecture than during the control period.,0
Mean (+/-SE) up time (standing and stepping) for the 1st minute of the 20 minute post-lecture period was double that of the last minute (32.8 +/- 5.73 s to 16.5 +/- 5.41 s) while it remained low throughout the comparison period on the control day (p = 0.01).,0
Subjects also took more steps (p = 0.006) and engaged in more transitions between sitting and standing (p = 0.02) after the lecture than after the control period.,0
These results support the conclusion that stressful daily life situations that elicit affective arousal also elicit increased physical activity in the form of restless movement and suggest that affective responses to stressful situations may be important determinants of physical activity during daily life.,1
OBJECTIVE: Although research often relies on retrospective affect self-reports little is known about personality's role in retrospective reports and how these converge or deviate from affect reported in the moment.,0
This micro-longitudinal study examines personality (Neuroticism Extraversion) and emotional salience (peak and recent affect) associations with retrospective-momentary affect report discrepancies over different time frames.,1
METHOD: Participants were 179 adults aged 20-78 (M = 48.7 years; 73.7% Caucasian/White) who each provided up to 60 concurrent affect reports over 10 days then retrospectively reported overall intensity of each affective state after 1 day and again after 1-2 months.,0
RESULTS: Multilevel models revealed that individuals retrospectively overreported or underreported various affective states exhibiting peak associations for high arousal positive and negative affect recency associations for low arousal positive affect and distinct personality profiles that strengthened over time.,0
Individuals high in both Extraversion and Neuroticism exaggerated high arousal positive and negative affect and underreported low arousal positive affect high Extraversion/low Neuroticism individuals exaggerated high arousal positive affect and underreported low arousal positive affect and low Extraversion/high Neuroticism individuals exaggerated high and low arousal negative affect.,0
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to identify arousal-specific retrospective affect report discrepancies over time and suggests retrospective reports also reflect personality differences in affective self-knowledge.,1
Adolescence is a sensitive period for changes in both sleep and affect.,0
Although past research has assessed the association between affect and sleep among adolescents few studies have examined both trait (typical) and day-to-day changes in affect and fewer still have specifically examined negative social evaluative emotions (e.g.,1
embarrassment) in relation to sleep.,0
Both between- and within-person variations in daily affect were examined in relation to four objectively-measured sleep outcomes (sleep hours; sleep latency; sleep efficiency; and length of wake bouts) among adolescents.,0
Participants (N = 77 high-school students; 42.9% female; M = 14.37 years) wore an actiwatch and completed daily-diaries for 3 days.,0
The results of hierarchical linear models (controlling for age gender race ethnicity parental employment status income puberty and caffeine) indicated that negative social evaluative emotions and high-arousal affective experiences generally predicted poor sleep outcomes whereas low-arousal affective experiences were associated with good sleep outcomes.,0
Specifically at the person level adolescents reporting higher negative social evaluative emotions had shorter average sleep hours and those experiencing higher anxiety-nervousness had longer wake bouts.,0
In addition individuals experiencing more dysphoria (sad depressed lonely) had longer average sleep hours and shorter wake bouts while those experiencing more calmness had shorter sleep latencies.,0
At the within-person level individuals had longer sleep latencies following days that they had experienced high-arousal positive affect (e.g.,1
excitement) and had longer wake bouts following days they had experienced more negative social evaluative emotions.,0
The results highlight the detrimental effects of negative social evaluative emotions and high-arousal affective states for adolescent sleep.,1
Pupil size is usually regarded as a passive information channel that provides insight into cognitive and affective states but defies any further control.,0
However in a recent study (Ehlers et al.,0
2015) we demonstrate that sympathetic activity indexed by pupil dynamics allows strategic interference by means of simple cognitive techniques.,0
Utilizing positive/negative imaginings subjects were able to expand pupil diameter beyond baseline variations; albeit with varying degrees of success and only over brief periods.,0
The current study provides a comprehensive replication on the basis of considerable changes to the experimental set-up.,0
Results show that stricter methodological conditions (controlled baseline settings and specified user instructions) strengthen the reported effect whereas overall performance increases by one standard deviation.,0
Effects are thereby not restricted to pupillary level.,0
Parallel recordings of skin conductance changes prove a general enhancement of induced autonomic arousal.,1
Considering the stability of the results across studies we conclude that pupil size information exceeds affective monitoring and may constitute an active input channel in human-computer interaction.,0
Furthermore since variations in pupil diameter reliably display self-induced changes in sympathetic arousal the relevance of this parameter is strongly indicated for future approaches in clinical biofeedback.,1
Romantic relationships although increasingly normative during adolescence also present unique developmental challenges that can portend psychological difficulties.,0
Underlying these difficulties may be the degree to which daily romantic transactions potentiate fluctuations in negative mood.,0
The present study examined associations between adolescents' daily romantic relationship experiences and their same-day negative affective states (i.e. fluctuations in high-arousal aversive mood).,1
Using a dyadic ecological momentary assessment (EMA) design this study followed an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample of 98 adolescent romantic couples twice weekly for 12 weeks (n = 196 individuals; Mage = 16.74 years SD = 0.90; 45% Latina/o 45% White; 55% receiving free or reduced meals).,0
The results indicated that various daily romantic experiences (e.g. conflict feelings about the relationship) predicted greater same-day negative affect.,0
Beyond the effects of these romantic experiences adolescent couples were also synchronized in their fluctuating negative affective states evidencing the presence of emotional contagion.,1
Overall the findings indicate the salience of romantic relationships in the everyday lives of adolescents.,0
Recent investigations emphasized the role of communication features on behavioral trust and reciprocity in economic decision making but no studies have been focused on the effect of communication on affective states in such a context.,0
Thanks to advanced methods of computational psychometrics in this study affective states were deeply examined using simultaneous and synchronized recordings of gazes and psychophysiological signals in 28 female students during an investment game.,1
Results showed that participants experienced different affective states according to the type of communication (personal versus impersonal).,1
In particular participants involved in personal communication felt more relaxed than participants involved in impersonal communication.,0
Moreover personal communication influenced reciprocity and participants' perceptions about trust and reciprocity.,0
Findings were interpreted in the light of the Arousal/Valence Model and self-disclosure process.,0
Humans experience emotions every day.,0
Traditionally psychology has described emotions through discrete labels (e.g.,0
happy afraid) or standardized affective dimensions (e.g.,0
valence arousal) and neuroscience has more recently sought the neurobiological basis of emotions via functional neuroimaging.,1
However by treating emotions similarly among everyone we neglect that emotions are individualized; thus the overall relational structure of an individual's emotion information may be vital in understanding how the brain represents emotions.,0
Combining behavioral and functional MRI experiments with similarity analyses we demonstrate that neural activity patterns in the left insula correspond to the multi-dimensional arrangement of individuals' affective spaces despite interindividual differences better than to a group-averaged model of affective space a standardized valence-arousal space a semantic category space and a visual similarity space.,0
This finding suggests that the insula may underlie individual-level affective information processing that is specific to one's own affective states which offers new opportunities for functional neuroimaging to inform clinical approaches of disorders involving emotion dysregulation.,1
Time-sampling methodology was implemented to examine the prospective associations between affect desire to gamble and gambling behavior in individuals diagnosed with a mood disorder.,1
Thirty (9 male 21 female) adults with a lifetime diagnosis of a depressive or bipolar disorder diagnosis who endorsed current gambling and lifetime gambling harm participated in the present study.,0
Participants completed electronic diary entries of their current affective state desire to gamble and gambling behavior for 30 consecutive days.,0
Hierarchical linear modelling revealed that affect was not a predictor of gambling behavior.,0
Instead affect predicted the desire to gamble with high levels of sadness and arousal independently predicting an increased desire to gamble.,1
Desire to gamble predicted actual gambling behavior.,0
There were no differences across diagnostic groups in terms of gambling motivations at baseline; however during the 30-day period participants with bipolar disorder endorsed gambling to cope with negative affect more often than did participants with depressive disorder whereas those with depressive disorder more often endorsed gambling for social reasons or enhancement of positive affect.,0
The present findings provide evidence that negative affect is not directly related to actual gambling behavior and suggest that affective states rather impact the desire to gamble.,1
Defining the structural organization of emotions is a central unresolved question in affective science.,0
In particular the extent to which autonomic nervous system activity signifies distinct affective states remains controversial.,1
Most prior research on this topic has used univariate statistical approaches in attempts to classify emotions from psychophysiological data.,0
In the present study electrodermal cardiac respiratory and gastric activity as well as self-report measures were taken from healthy subjects during the experience of fear anger sadness surprise contentment and amusement in response to film and music clips.,0
Information pertaining to affective states present in these response patterns was analyzed using multivariate pattern classification techniques.,0
Overall accuracy for classifying distinct affective states was 58.0% for autonomic measures and 88.2% for self-report measures both of which were significantly above chance.,0
Further examining the error distribution of classifiers revealed that the dimensions of valence and arousal selectively contributed to decoding emotional states from self-report whereas a categorical configuration of affective space was evident in both self-report and autonomic measures.,1
Taken together these findings extend recent multivariate approaches to study emotion and indicate that pattern classification tools may improve upon univariate approaches to reveal the underlying structure of emotional experience and physiological expression.,0
