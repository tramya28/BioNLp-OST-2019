BACKGROUND: Hammock positioning is now frequently used with preterm infants admitted to ICUs.,0
However few studies have investigated the extent to which hammock positioning reduces pain and improves the sleep-wakefulness state compared with traditional positioning.,1
METHODS: Twenty-six clinically stable newborns with gestational ages from 30 to 37 weeks who were breathing spontaneously were randomly assigned to 2 groups: a hammock-positioning group (n = 13) in which newborns were placed in hammocks in the lateral position and a traditional-positioning group (n = 13) in which they were kept nested also in the lateral position.,0
The following variables were evaluated at the beginning and the end of the treatment: pain (with the Premature Infant Pain Profile and Neonatal Facial Coding System) sleep-wakefulness state (with the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale) heart rate breathing frequency and peripheral SpO2 .,0
RESULTS: The subjects in the hammock-positioning group showed an improvement in pain compared with the traditional-positioning group(Premature Infant Pain Profile score 2.62 +/- 1.89 vs 2.31 +/- 1.97 DeltaP = .008) and sleep-wakefulness state score (2.08 +/- 0.64 vs 1.23 +/- 0.44 Delta P < .001) reduced heart rate (151.69 +/- 5.44 vs 142.77 +/- 5.18 beats/min Delta P < .001) breathing frequency (52.31 +/- 4.05 vs 50.23 +/- 2.55 beats/min Delta P = .024) and increased peripheral SpO2 (94.69 +/- 2.14 vs 98.00 +/- 1.22% Delta P < .001).,0
CONCLUSIONS: Hammock positioning was an effective treatment option to reduce pain and improve sleep-wakefulness state.,1
It also helped to reduce heart rate and breathing frequency and to increase peripheral SpO2  which made it a treatment option for preterm infants.,0
The possession of a rhythm is usually described as an important adaptation to regular changing environmental conditions such as the light-dark cycle.,0
However recent studies have suggested plasticity in the expression of a rhythm depending on life history and environmental factors.,0
Barn owl ( Tyto alba) nestlings show variations in behavior and physiology in relation to the size of black feather spots a trait associated with many behavioral and physiological phenotypes including the circadian expression of corticosterone and the regulation of body mass.,0
This raises the possibility that individual spottiness could be associated with rhythmicity in sleep-wakefulness.,1
Owlets showed ultradian rhythms in sleep-wakefulness with a period length of 4.5 to 4.9 h. The period length of wakefulness and non-REM sleep was shorter in heavily compared to lightly spotted female nestlings whereas in males the opposite result was found.,1
Furthermore male and female nestlings displaying small black spots showed strong rhythmicity levels in wakefulness and REM sleep.,0
This might be an advantage in a stable environment with predictable periodic changes in light temperature or social interactions.,0
Heavily spotted nestlings displayed weak rhythms in wakefulness and REM sleep which might enable them to be more flexible in reactions to unexpected events such as predation or might be a mechanism to save energy.,0
These findings are consistent with previous findings showing that large-spotted nestlings switch more frequently between wakefulness and sleep resulting in higher levels of vigilance compared to small-spotted conspecifics.,1
Thus nestlings with larger black feather spots might differently handle the trade-off between wakefulness and sleep attention and social interactions compared to nestlings with smaller black spots.,0
Distributed neural networks in the brain sustain generation of wakefulness and two sleep states: non-REM sleep and REM sleep.,0
These three behavioral states are jointly ingrained in a rhythmic sequence that constitutes the sleep-wakefulness cycle.,0
This paper reviews and updates knowledge about the involvement of the histaminergic system in sleep-wakefulness cycle organization.,1
Histaminergic neurons are exclusively located in the hypothalamic tuberomammillary nucleus but are the source of a widespread projection system to many brain regions.,0
Histamine neurons are active during waking especially with high attention need and remain silent in both non-REM and REM sleep.,1
There have been described four metabotropic histamine receptors of which H1R H2R and H3R are present in the nervous system.,0
H1R and H2R are mainly postsynaptic heteroreceptors whereas H3R is thought to be mostly a presynaptic auto- and hetero-receptor.,0
Histaminergic neurons are excited by hypocretinergic neurons and most of the arousing hypocretin effects are thought to depend on histaminergic actions.,0
Interactions among histaminergic axons and cholinergic nuclei within forebrain and brainstem are particularly important for cortical activation.,0
In contrast histaminergic tuberomammillary neurons similarly to other aminergic neurons in locus coeruleus or dorsal raphe nucleus are inhibited by non-REM sleep-promoting neurons of the preoptic region.,0
Further inhibitory actions on histamine neurons come from adenosine release on tuberomammillary region.,0
Finally histaminergic neurons inhibit REM-on hypothalamic neurons containing melanine-concentrating hormone thus supporting a permissive role of tuberomammillary nucleus in REM sleep.,1
Actually knockout mice for histidine decarboxylase the enzyme synthetizing histamine show a significant REM sleep increase.,0
The work was aimed for the ascertainment of following question - whether Orexin-containing neurons of dorsal and lateral hypothalamus and brain Orexinergic system in general are those cellular targets which can accelerate recovery of disturbed sleep homeostasis and restoration of sleep-wakefulness cycle behavioral states from barbiturate anesthesia-induced artificial sleep.,1
Investigation was carried out on 18 wild type white rats (weight 200-250gr).,0
Different doses of Nembutal Sodium were used for the initiation of deep anesthesia.,0
30 min after barbiturate anesthesia induced artificial sleep serial electrical stimulations of dorsal or lateral hypothalamus were started.,0
Stimulation period lasted for 1 hour with the 5 min intervals between subsequent stimulations applied by turn to the left and right side hypothalamic parts.,0
EEG registration of cortical and hippocampal electrical activity was started 10 min after intra-peritoneal administration of Nembutal Sodium and continued continuously during 72 hour.,0
According to obtained new evidences serial electrical stimulations of dorsal and lateral hypothalamic Orexin-containing neurons significantly accelerate recovery of wakefulness sleep homeostasis disturbed because of barbiturate anesthesia induced artificial sleep and different behavioral states of sleep-wakefulness cycle.,0
Hypothalamic Orexin-containing neurons can be considered as the cellular targets for regulating of sleep homeostasis through the acceleration of recovery of wakefulness and SWC in general from barbiturate anesthesia-induced deep sleep.,1
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether perinatal smoking exposure is associated with gastroesophageal reflux (GER)-related changes in sleep-wakefulness states in neonates.,1
STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-one neonates referred for the investigation of suspected GER were recruited and underwent multichannel impedance-pH monitoring and synchronized 8- to 12-hour polysomnography.,0
The infants' exposure to tobacco smoke was estimated by means of a urine cotinine assay.,0
The total number frequency (h(-1)) and mean duration (minutes) of GER-pH (reflux events detected by the pH electrode only) and GER-imp (reflux events with bolus movement detected by impedance) events were determined.,0
Intergroup differences (smoking-exposed group vs nonexposed group) were probed with nonparametric unpaired Mann-Whitney U tests.,0
A chi(2) test was used to assess a possible intergroup difference in bolus retrograde migration during GER-imp events.,0
RESULTS: According to the urine cotinine assay 21 of the 31 neonates had been exposed to cigarette smoke during the perinatal period.,0
The number (and frequency) of GER-imp was significantly greater (P = .016) in the exposed group (29 [0-90]) than in the nonexposed group (12 [2-35]).,0
Migration of the esophageal bolus from the distal segment to the most proximal segment was significantly more frequent (P = .016) in the exposed group (83% of GER) than in the nonexposed group (41%).,0
The GER pattern associated with smoking exposure was particularly obvious during Rapid eye movement sleep.,0
CONCLUSIONS: The more frequent occurrence and greater proximal migration of GER-imp in the smoking-exposed group (especially during rapid eye movement sleep) may have clinical relevance.,1
Smoking exposure is a preventable risk factor for limiting the occurrence of GER in neonates.,0
The work was aimed for the ascertainment of following question - whether Orexin-containing neurons of dorsal and lateral hypothalamic and brain Orexinergic system in general are those cellular targets which can speed up recovery of disturbed sleep homeostasis and accelerate restoration of sleep-wakefulness cycle phases during some pathological conditions - experimental comatose state and/or deep anesthesia-induced sleep.,1
Study was carried out on white rats.,0
Modeling of experimental comatose state was made by midbrain cytotoxic lesions at intra-collicular level.Animals were under artificial respiration and special care.,1
Different doses of Sodium Ethaminal were used for deep anesthesia.,0
30 min after comatose state and/or deep anesthesia induced sleep serial electrical stimulations of posterior and/or perifornical hypothalamus were started.,0
Stimulation period lasted for 1 hour with the 5 min intervals between subsequent stimulations applied by turn to the left and right side hypothalamic parts.EEG registration of cortical and hippocampal electrical activity was started immediately after experimental comatose state and deep anesthesia induced sleep and continued continuously during 72 hour.,0
According to obtained new evidences serial electrical stimulations of posterior and perifornical hypothalamic Orexin-containing neurons significantly accelerate recovery of sleep homeostasis disturbed because of comatose state and/or deep anesthesia induced sleep.,0
Speed up recovery of sleep homeostasis was manifested in acceleration of coming out from comatose state and deep anesthesia induced sleep and significant early restoration of sleep-wakefulness cycle behavioral states.,1
BACKGROUND: Anesthesia and surgery disturb sleep.,0
Disturbed sleep adversely affects postoperative complications involving the cardiovascular system diabetes and infection.,0
General anesthetics share neuronal mechanisms involving endogenous sleep-wakefulness-related substances such as orexin (OX) and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH).,0
We evaluated changes in sleep architecture and the concentration of OX and MCH during the peri-anesthetic period.,1
METHODS: To examine sleep architecture male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 350-450 g received ketamine 100 mg/kg (n = 9) or propofol 80 mg/kg (n = 6) by intraperitoneal injection.,0
Electroencephalography was recorded from 2 days pre- to 5 days postanesthesia.,0
To quantify levels of OX and MCH 144 similar rats received the same doses of ketamine (n = 80) or propofol (n = 64).,0
Brain concentrations of these substances were determined at 0 20 60 and 120 min after anesthetic administration.,0
RESULTS: Ketamine decreased OX content in the hypothalamus during the anesthesia period.,0
OX content was restored to pre-anesthesia levels in the hypothalamus and pons.,0
Both anesthetics increased brain MCH content in the postanesthetic period with the degree of increase being greater with propofol.,0
Ketamine enhanced wakefulness and inhibited non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) immediately after anesthesia.,0
Conversely propofol inhibited wakefulness and enhanced NREMS in that period.,0
Ketamine inhibited wakefulness and enhanced NREMS during the dark phase on the first postanesthesia day.,0
CONCLUSIONS: Anesthetics affect various endogenous sleep-wakefulness-related substances; however the modulation pattern may depend on the type of anesthetic.,1
The process of postanesthetic sleep disturbance was agent specific.,0
Our results provide fundamental evidence to treat anesthetic-related sleep disturbance.,0
The perifornical area in the posterior lateral hypothalamus (PeFLH) has been implicated in several physiological functions including the sleep-wakefulness regulation.,0
The PeFLH area contains several cell types including those expressing orexins (Orx; also known as hypocretins) mainly located in the PeF nucleus.,0
The aim of the present study was to elucidate the synaptic interactions between Orx neurons located in the PeFLH area and different brainstem neurons involved in the generation of wakefulness and sleep stages such as the locus coeruleus (LC) nucleus (contributing to wakefulness) and the oral pontine reticular nucleus (PnO) nucleus (contributing to REM sleep).,1
Anatomical data demonstrated the existence of a neuronal network involving the PeFLH area LC and the PnO nuclei that would control the sleep-wake cycle.,0
Electrophysiological experiments indicated that PeFLH area had an excitatory effect on LC neurons.,0
PeFLH stimulation increased the firing rate of LC neurons and induced an activation of the EEG.,0
The excitatory effect evoked by PeFLH stimulation in LC neurons was blocked by the injection of the Orx-1 receptor antagonist SB-334867 into the LC.,0
Similar electrical stimulation of the PeFLH area evoked an inhibition of PnO neurons by activation of GABAergic receptors because the effect was blocked by bicuculline application into the PnO.,0
Our data also revealed that the LC and PnO nuclei exerted a feedback control on neuronal activity of PeFLH area.,0
Electrical stimulation of LC facilitated firing activity of PeFLH neurons by activation of catecholaminergic receptors whereas PnO stimulation inhibited PeFLH neurons by activation of GABAergic receptors.,0
In conclusion Orx neurons of the PeFLH area seem to be an important organizer of the wakefulness and sleep stages in order to maintain a normal succession of stages during the sleep-wakefulness cycle.,1
AIM: Under natural conditions diurnal rhythms of biological processes of the organism are synchronized with each other and to the environmental changes by means of the circadian system.,0
Disturbances of the latter affect hormonal levels sleep-wakefulness cycle and cognitive performance.,0
To study mechanisms of such perturbations animal models subjected to artificial photoperiods are often used.,0
The goal of current study was to understand the effects of circadian rhythm disruption caused by a short light-dark cycle regime on activity of the cerebral cortex in rodents.,1
METHODS: We used electroencephalogram to assess the distribution of vigilance states perform spectral analysis and estimate the homeostatic sleep drive.,0
In addition we analyzed spontaneous locomotion of C57BL/6J mice under symmetric 22- 21- and 20-h-long light-dark cycles using video recording and tracking methods.,0
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found that shortening of photoperiod caused a significant increase of slow wave activity during non-rapid eye movement sleep suggesting an elevation of sleep pressure under such conditions.,0
While the rhythm of spontaneous locomotion was completely entrained by all light-dark cycles tested periodic changes in the power of the theta- and gamma-frequency ranges during wakefulness gradually disappeared under 22- and 21-h-long light-dark cycles.,0
This was associated with a significant increase in the theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling during wakefulness.,0
Our results thus provide deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the impairment of learning and memory retention which is associated with disturbed circadian regulation.,1
The role of orexin in the organization of sleep-wakefulness cycle (SWC) is well known.,0
The aim of this study was to examine the terms of formation of the orexinergic system in the rat postnatal ontogenesis and to assess the role of orexin A in SWC organization under normal conditions and after prenatal hypoxia realized on days 14 and 19 of the embryogenesis.,1
SWC was investigated in 30-day-old rats with elect- rodes implanted into the somatosensory and occipital cortex.,0
Immunoreactivity in the orexinergic structures of the lateral hypothalamus was also studied.,0
It was shown that in the control 14-day-old animals the orexinergic structures were at the formation stage whereas in the 30-day-old ones they were already formed as in adults.,0
In the 14-day-old rats prenatal hypoxia evoked retardation of the orexinergic system for- mation terms.,0
In the 30-day-old rats the orexinergic system activity after hypoxia was increased with hypoxia on day 19 activating this system stronger than hypoxia on day 14 of gestation.,0
These changes were reflected in the SWC formation in the 30-day-old rats as shortening of the slow-wave phase of sleep increase in the fitful sleep and in the number of transitions from the slow-wave to the fast-wave phase of sleep.,1
The results obtained are discussed in the light of the adaptation-compensatory role of the orexinergic system in the postnatal ontogenesis after prenatal damage affecting the central neural system.,0
The results of study of sleep-wakefulness cycle in experimental models of pre-clinical and early clinical stages of Parkinson's disease present and compared to some clinical examples.,0
The conclusion is the increase in activity level and decrease in total amount of slow wave and paradoxical sleep in model animals are taking place at the same circadian period of the secretion of pineal melatonin as sleep disorders in patients.,1
Several research groups have developed automated sleep-wakefulness classifiers for night wrist actigraphic (ACT) data.,0
These classifiers tend to be unbalanced with a tendency to overestimate the detection of sleep at the expense of poorer detection of wakefulness.,1
The reason for this is that the measure of success in previous works was the maximization of the overall accuracy disregarding the balance between sensitivity and specificity.,0
The databases were usually sleep recordings hence the over-representation of sleep samples.,0
In this work an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) sleep-wakefulness classifier is presented.,1
ACT data was collected every minute.,0
An 11-min moving window was used as observing frame for data analysis as applied in previous sleep ACT studies.,0
However our feature set adds new variables such as the time of the day the median and the median absolute deviation.,0
Sleep and Wakefulness data were balanced to improve the system training.,1
A comparison with previous studies can still be done by choosing the point in the ROC curve associated with the corresponding data balance.,0
Our results are compared with a polysomnogram-based hypnogram as golden standard rendering an accuracy of 92.8% a sensitivity of 97.6% and a specificity of 73.4%.,0
Geometric mean between sensitivity and specificity is 84.9%.,0
The interaction of age with shift rotation in relation to sleep-wakefulness and inflammation were studied among male employees (n = 772).,1
Cross-sectional analyses in day two-shift and three-shift work with different shift rotations as well as changes in leukocytes and hsCRP among three shift workers who changed their shift system during the 2.5- yr follow-up were completed.,0
Shift work was associated with problems to fall asleep (p < 0.001) and feeling of the current working time being harmful to sleep and wakefulness (p < 0.001).,1
Quickly forward-rotation shift workers considered their working time less harmful compared with slower backward-rotation shift workers.,0
Age did not influence sleep in general but older workers in the quickly forward-rotating three-shift system had less sleep complaints than their younger colleagues.,1
The age differences in the inflammatory markers partly depended on the shift system.,0
The results give some support that rapidly forward-rotating shift systems are more 'age-friendly' than backward-rotating shift systems.,0
The alcohol-preferring (P) rat is a valid animal model of alcoholism.,0
However the effect of alcohol on sleep in P or alcohol non-preferring (NP) rats is unknown.,0
Since alcohol consumption has tremendous impact on sleep the present study compared the effects of binge alcohol administration on sleep-wakefulness in P and NP rats.,1
Using standard surgical procedures the P and NP rats were bilaterally implanted with sleep recording electrodes.,0
Following post-operative recovery and habituation pre-ethanol (baseline) sleep-wakefulness was electrographically recorded for 48 h. Subsequently ethanol was administered beginning with a priming dose of 5 g/Kg followed by two doses of 2 g/Kg every 8 h on the first day and three doses of 3 g/Kg/8 h on the second day.,0
On the following day (post-ethanol) undisturbed sleep-wakefulness was electrographically recorded for 24 h. Our initial results suggest that during baseline conditions the time spent in each of the three behavioral states: wakefulness non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and REM sleep was comparable between P and NP rats.,0
However the P rats were more susceptible to changes in sleep-wakefulness following 2 days of binge ethanol treatment.,0
As compared to NP rats the P rats displayed insomnia like symptoms including a significant reduction in the amount of time spent in NREM sleep coupled with a significant increase in wakefulness on post-ethanol day.,0
Subsequent analysis revealed that binge ethanol induced increased wakefulness and reduced NREM sleep in P rats occurred mainly in the dark period.,0
This is the first study that: (1) demonstrates spontaneous sleep-wake profile in P and NP rats and (2) compares the effects of binge ethanol treatment on sleep in P and NP rats.,0
Our results suggest that as compared to NP rats the P rats were more susceptible to sleep disruptions after binge ethanol treatment.,1
In addition the P rats exhibited insomnia-like symptoms observed during abstinence from alcohol in human subjects.,0
Hypocretins or orexins (Hcrt/Orx) are hypothalamic neuropeptides that are synthesized by neurons located mainly in the perifornical area of the posterolateral hypothalamus.,0
These hypothalamic neurons are the origin of an extensive and divergent projection system innervating numerous structures of the central nervous system.,0
In recent years it has become clear that these neuropeptides are involved in the regulation of many organic functions such as feeding thermoregulation and neuroendocrine and cardiovascular control as well as in the control of the sleep-wakefulness cycle.,1
In this respect Hcrt/Orx activate two subtypes of G protein-coupled receptors (Hcrt/Orx1R and Hcrt/Orx2R) that show a partly segregated and prominent distribution in neural structures involved in sleep-wakefulness regulation.,0
Wakefulness-enhancing and/or sleep-suppressing actions of Hcrt/Orx have been reported in specific areas of the brainstem.,0
Moreover presently there are animal models of human narcolepsy consisting in modifications of Hcrt/Orx receptors or absence of these peptides.,0
This strongly suggests that narcolepsy is the direct consequence of a hypofunction of the Hcrt/Orx system which is most likely due to Hcrt/Orx neurons degeneration.The main focus of this review is to update and illustrate the available data on the actions of Hcrt/Orx neuropeptides with special interest in their participation in the control of the sleep-wakefulness cycle and the regulation of energy homeostasis.,1
Current pharmacological treatment of narcolepsy is also discussed.,0
Data about behavioral somato-vegetative and neurophysiological parameters of sleep and wakefulness in insects cold- and warm-blooded vertebrates are provided.,0
Hypotheses existing now about evolutionary formation of separate sleep phases and stages in vertebrates are considered.,0
In the review are shown the data about correlations of quantitative characteristics of sleep and wake in some mammals with basic metabolic rate lifestyle environmental habits.,1
The original experimental results at formation of neurophysiological characteristics of sleep and wake in vertebrates phylogeny and in ontogeny of mature and immature mammals are provided in detail.,0
On the basis of own concepts about evolutionary development of sleep-wakefulness cycle in vertebrates the interactions of telencephalic diencephalic and rhombencepalic parts of brain in the processes of cycle wakefulness cycle integration are discussed.,1
BACKGROUND: Infants exposed to opioides in-utero frequently demonstrate withdrawal symptoms in the neonatal period and have difficulties with state regulation.,0
AIM: This study examines sleep-wakefulness-distress patterns as indicators of regulatory mechanisms at 3 months of age.,1
PARTICIPANTS: A national infant cohort (N=35) born to women in high-dose maintenance treatment during pregnancy and a comparison group (N=36) of low-risk infants born in the same period.,0
OUTCOME MEASURES: Distributions and frequencies of sleep wakefulness and distress measured in hours and episodes on sleep charts recorded by the mothers in the two groups.,0
RESULTS: Women in maintenance treatment were monitored closely during pregnancy to avoid illicit drug use and to be prepared for motherhood.,0
They were also offered residential treatment before pregnancy and after the child was born.,0
There were no statistical differences between the two groups in any of the 10 measures reflecting diurnal and nocturnal rhythmicity at 3 months despite of neonatal abstinence syndrome in 47% of the exposed infants and significant differences in infant characteristics with respect to birth weight gestational age and maternal characteristics.,0
CONCLUSIONS: Follow-up procedures combining drug monitoring and counseling during pregnancy and in the first months after birth enhance the development of state regulation in terms of sleep-wakefulness patterns.,1
Behavioral states alternate between wakefulness (wk) rapid eye movement (rem) and non-rem (nrem) sleep at time scale of hours i.e. light and dark cycle rhythms and from several tens of minutes to seconds (i.e. brief awakenings during sleep).,0
Using statistical analysis of bout duration Markov chains of sleep-wk dynamics and quantitative EEG analysis we evaluated the influence of light/dark (ld) changes on brain function along the sleep-wk cycle.,1
Bout duration (bd) histograms and Kaplan-Meier (km) survival curves of wk showed a bimodal statistical distribution suggesting that two types of wk do exist: brief-wk (wkb) and long-wk (wkl).,0
Light changes modulated specifically wkl bouts increasing its duration during active/dark period.,0
In contrast wkb nrem and rem bd histograms and km curves did not change significantly along ld cycle.,0
Hippocampal eeg of both types of wk were different: in comparison wkb showed a lower spectral power in fast gamma and fast theta bands and less emg tone.,0
After fitting a four-states Markov chain to mice hypnograms moreover in states transition probabilities matrix was found that: in dark/active period state-maintenance probability of wkl increased and probability of wkl to nrem transition decreased; the opposite was found in light period favoring the hypothesis of the participation of brief wk into nrem-rem intrinsic sleep cycle and the role of wkl in SWS homeostasis.,0
In conclusion we propose an extended Markov model of sleep using four stages (wkl nrem rem wkb) as a fully adequate model accounting for both modulation of sleep-wake dynamics based on the differential regulation of long-wk (high gamma/theta) epochs during dark and light phases.,1
The Hypocretin1/OrexinA (Hcrt1/OxA) neuropeptides are found in a group of posterolateral hypothalamus neurons and are involved in sleep-wakefulness cycle regulation.,0
Hcrt1/OxA neurons project widely to brainstem aminergic structures such as the locus coeruleus (LC) which are involved in maintenance of wakefulness and EEG activation through intense projections to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).,0
Moreover defects of the Hcrt1/OxA system are linked to narcolepsy a disorder characterized by excessive diurnal hypersomnia and REM state disturbance.,0
We aimed to determine whether Hcrt1/OxA neurons innervate LC neurons (noradrenergic and nonnoradrenergic) that project to the mPFC thereby sustaining behavioral wakefulness.,1
To assess this we used retrograde tracing from mPFC injections and either Hcrt1/OxA or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemical labeling in single sections of rat LC.,0
The retrograde tracer Fluorogold (FG) was microinjected into mPFC and at optimal survival periods sections through the LC were processed for dual immunolabeling of anti-FG and either anti-Hcrt1/OxA or anti-TH antisera.,0
Many LC neurons projecting to mPFC were nonnoradrenergic.,0
Electron microscopy revealed a prominent localization of Hcrt1/OxA in unmyelinated axons and axon boutons (varicosities and axon terminals) within the LC.,0
Hcrt1/OxA-immunoreactive axon boutons frequently apposed (104/1907) or made asymmetric excitatory-type synapses (60/1907) with FG-immunolabeled dendrites indicating that Hcrt1/OxA can modulate the activity of LC neurons with cortical projections.,0
Our results show that Hcrt1/OxA hypothalamic neurons likely excite LC neurons that project to the mPFC and thus activate EEG and facilitate wakefulness.,1
In narcoleptics who are deficient in Hcrt1/OxA impairment of this Hcrt1/OxA hypothalamic input to LC might contribute to the appearance of excessive daytime sleepiness.,0
The aim of our study was to investigate the role of dopaminergic system in telencephalic and diencephalic brain regions of vertebrates in sleep-wakefulness cycle.,1
The level of thyrosine-hydroxylase--the main enzyme in dopamine synthesis--was measured in striatum zona inserta supraoptic and arcuate nuclea of hypothalamus in fish (Acipenceridae) and in mammals (rats) in ontogenesis (14- 30-day old rats and adult animals) under tactile and sleep deprivation stresses.,0
The thyrosine-hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells were revealed in all brain regions of fishes after a short-term stress.,0
In the group after longtime stress the thyrosine-hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells and fibers were almost absent in anterior brain but were found in hypothalamic nuclea.,0
At 14-day old rats 2-hour sleep deprivation caused increasing of thyrosine-hydroxylase-immunoreactivity both in fibers of caudate nucleus as well as in cells of the zona inserta.,0
A 6-hour deprivation caused increasing of thyrosine-hydroxylase-immunoreactive material level in cells of zona inserta and decreasing it in fibers of 30-day old rats.,0
In adult rats the level of thyrosine-hydroxylase-immunoreactive material decreased in nucleus arcuatus and zona inserta after sleep deprivation and increased after sleep.,0
Data obtained are discussed in terms ofphylo- and ontogenetic development of neurosecretory and neurotransmitter functions of dopaminergic system in evolutionary old diencephalic and evolutionary young telencephalic brain regions of vertebrates which are the important systems of starting and maintenance of some functional conditions of the organism in sleep-wakefulness cycle.,1
Gaboxadol or 4567-tetrahydroisoxazolo-[54-c]pyridine-3-ol (THIP) is a selective agonist for the delta-subunit containing extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors that will soon enter the U.S. market as a sleep aid [Winsky-Sommerer R Vyazovskiy VV Homanics GE Tobler I (2007) The EEG effects of THIP (gaboxadol) on sleep and waking are mediated by the GABA(A)delta-subunit-containing receptors.,0
Eur J Neurosci 25:1893-1899].,0
Numerous studies have shown that systemic administration of THIP reduces wakefulness and increases sleep both in humans and rats [Lancel M Langebartels A (2000) Gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) agonist 4567-tetrahydroisoxazolo[45-c]pyridin-3-ol persistently increases sleep maintenance and intensity during chronic administration to rats.,1
J Pharmacol Exp Ther 293:1084-1090; Walsh JK Deacon S Dijk DJ Lundahl J (2007) The selective extrasynaptic GABAA agonist gaboxadol improves traditional hypnotic efficacy measures and enhances slow wave activity in a model of transient insomnia.,0
Sleep 30:593-602].,0
However it is yet unclear where in the brain THIP acts to promote sleep.,0
Since the perifornical lateral hypothalamus (PFH) contains orexin neurons and orexin neurons are critical for maintenance of arousal [McCarley RW (2007) Neurobiology of rapid eye movement (REM) and NREM sleep.,1
Sleep Med 8:302-330] we hypothesized that THIP may act on PFH neurons to promote sleep.,0
To test our hypothesis we used reverse microdialysis to perfuse THIP unilaterally into the PFH and studied its effects on sleep-wakefulness during the light period in freely behaving rats.,0
Microdialysis perfusion of THIP (100 microM) into the PFH produced a significant reduction in wakefulness with a concomitant increase in non-rapid eye movement or slow wave sleep as compared with artificial cerebrospinal fluid perfusion.,0
REM sleep was unaffected.,0
This is the first study implicating the delta-subunit containing extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors in PFH in control of sleep-wakefulness in freely behaving rats.,1
Pannexins are membrane channel proteins that play a role in a number of critical biological processes (Panchin et al. 2000; Shestopalov Panchin 2008).,0
Among other cellular functions pannexin hemichannels serve as purine nucleoside conduits providing ATP efflux into the extracellular space (Dahl 2015) where it is rapidly degraded to adenosine.,0
Pannexin1 (Panx1) is abundantly expressed in the brain and has been shown to contribute to adenosine signaling in nervous system tissues (Prochnow et al. 2012).,0
We hypothesized that pannexin1 may contribute to sleep-wake cycle regulation through extracellular adenosine a well-established paracrine factor in slow wave sleep.,1
To investigate this link EEG and movement activity throughout the light/dark cycle were compared in Panx1(-/-) and Panx1(+/+) mice.,0
We found a significant increase in waking and a correspondent decrease in slow wave sleep percentages in the Panx1(-/-) animals.,0
These changes were especially pronounced during the dark period.,0
Furthermore we found a significant increase in movement activity of Panx1(-/-) mice.,0
These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that extracellular adenosine is relatively depleted in Panx1(-/-) animals due to the absence of the ATP-permeable hemichannels.,0
At the same time sleep rebound after a 6-h sleep deprivation remained unchanged in Panx1(-/-) mice as compared to the control animals.,1
Behavioral tests revealed that Panx1(-/-) mice were significantly faster during their descent along the vertical pole but more sluggish during their run through the horizontal pole as compared to the control mice.,0
The orexinergic neurons of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) are critical for wakefulness [McCarley RW (2007) Neurobiology of REM and NREM sleep.,0

Recent evidence suggests that adenosine (AD) a homeostatic sleep factor may act via A1 receptor (A1R) to control orexinergic activity and regulate sleep-wakefulness [Thakkar MM Winston S McCarley RW (2002) Orexin neurons of the hypothalamus express adenosine A1 receptors.,1
Brain Res 944:190-194; Liu ZW Gao XB (2006) Adenosine inhibits activity of hypocretin/orexin neurons via A1 receptor in the lateral hypothalamus: a possible sleep-promoting effect.,0
J Neurophysiol].,0
To evaluate the role of AD in the orexinergic LH and its influences on sleep-wakefulness we designed two experiments in freely behaving rats: First we bilaterally microinjected 13-dipropyl-8-phenylxanthine (DPX) (1.5 pmol and 15 pmol) a selective A1R antagonist into the LH during the light cycle and examined its effect on spontaneous sleep-wakefulness.,1
Second we performed 6 h of sleep deprivation.,0
Thirty minutes before the animals were allowed to enter recovery sleep 15 pmol of DPX was bilaterally microinjected into the LH and its effects on recovery sleep were monitored.,0
Microinjection of DPX into the orexinergic LH produced a significant increase in wakefulness with a concomitant reduction in sleep both during spontaneous bouts of sleep-wakefulness and during recovery sleep.,0
Local administration of DPX into the LH produced a significant increase in the latency to non-REM sleep during recovery sleep.,0
However total slow wave (delta) activity during non-REM sleep phase of recovery sleep remained unaffected after DPX treatment.,0
This is the first study that implicates endogenous adenosine to have a functional role in controlling orexinergic tone and influencing the homeostatic regulation of sleep-wakefulness.,1
The purpose of the present work was to study the effects of tolerance to ethanol on the sleep-wakefulness cycle (SWC) structure.,1
Experiments were carried out in chronic conditions on the adult cats (n=5).,0
The following methods were used: the stereotaxic - for implanting electrodes; polysomnographic - for EEG registration of the SWC structure.,0
Alcoholisation (0.2-2.5 g/kg 25% ethanol solution) was conducted by intraperitoneal injections that lasted for two weeks.,0
The obtained results were processed statistically and significance of the changes was determined by the Student t-test.,0
Low single doses of ethanol (0.2 - 0.5 g/kg) did not induce any significant changes in the structure of the SWC.,0
While using doses of 0.6 g/kg it was noted only increasing of the latent period of the onset of sleep.,0
However the structure of the SWC recovered within 1-2 hours after injection.,0
Increasing the dose to 1 g/kg caused severe intoxication.,0
This was reflected in a behavioral (anxiety tremor vocalizations) and autonomic (vomiting and frequent urination) signs.,0
Against the background of restless behavioral wakefulness synchronization of the characteristic of light slow-wave sleep developed.,0
The volume of deep slow-wave sleep was statistically significantly decreased and the latent period of the onset of paradoxical sleep was increased.,0
The structure of sleep was fragmented due to frequent awakenings.,0
For the fifth-eighth day of alcoholization the structure of the SWC restored behavioral and vegetative signs of intoxication disappeared which must indicate the development of tolerance to this dose of ethanol.,0
The obtained results signify that development of tolerance to ethanol can be reflected in the alteration of the structure of SWC.,0
Alcoholization disturbs the subtle mechanisms of the sleep due to destruction of brain homeostasis.,1
Sleep is a necessary diverse periodic and an active condition circadian and homeostatically regulated and precisely meshed with waking time into the sleep-wakefulness cycle (SWC).,0
Photic retinal stimulation modulates the suprachiasmatic nucleus which acts as the pacemaker for SWC rhythmicity.,0
Both the light period and social cues adjust the internal clock making the SWC a circadian 24-h period in the adult human.,0
Bioelectrical and behavioral parameters characterize the different phases of the SWC.,0
For a long time lesions and electrical stimulation of brain structures as well as connection studies were the main methods used to decipher the foundations of the functional anatomy of the SWC.,1
That is why the first section of this review presents these early historical studies to then discuss the current state of our knowledge based on our understanding of the functional anatomy of the structures underlying the SWC.,0
Supported by this description we then present a detailed review and update of the structures involved in the phase of wakefulness (W) including their morphological functional and chemical characteristics as well as their anatomical connections.,1
The structures for W generation are known as the ascending reticular activating system and they keep and maintain the thalamo-cerebral cortex unit awake.,0
This system originates from the neuronal groups located within the brainstem hypothalamus and basal forebrain which use known neurotransmitters and whose neurons are more active during W than during the other SWC states.,0
Thus synergies among several of these neurotransmitters are necessary to generate the cortical and thalamic activation that is characteristic of the W state with all the plastic qualities and nuances present in its different behavioral circumstances.,0
Each one of the neurotransmitters exerts powerful influences on the information and cognitive processes as well as attentional emotional motivational behavioral and arousal states.,0
The awake thalamo-cerebral cortex unit controls and adjusts the activation pattern through a top-down action on the subcortical cellular groups that are the origin of the ascending reticular activating system.,1
INTRODUCTION: The hypocretins/orexins are neuropeptides synthesized by a small neuronal cell group located in the posterior and lateral hypothalamus.,0
These peptides have been considered modulators of the sleep-wakefulness cycle since their discovery in 1998; the hypocretinergic/orexinergic system is very active during wakefulness.,0
In addition the absence of either these peptides or their receptors is associated to narcolepsy-cataplexy a disease in which the sleep-wakefulness cycle is completely disorganized.,1
DEVELOPMENT: Hypocretinergic/orexinergic neurons directly activate the cerebral cortex and neuronal cell groups of the reticular activating system containing noradrenaline serotonin dopamine acetylcholine and histamine through which they may also indirectly activate the cerebral cortex and enhance wakefulness; as well these neurons inhibit REM sleep generation in the ventral pontine tegmentum.,1
The decrease in the activity of hypocretinergic/orexinergic neurons during sleep inhibits the aminergic and cholinergic neurons of the reticular activating core decreasing cortical activation and renewing REM sleep generation in the ventral pontine tegmentum.,0
CONCLUSIONS: Hypocretins/orexins modulate wakefulness and EEG activation in part through their actions on reticular core neurons projecting to the cortex and suppress REM sleep generation through inhibition of ventral pontine tegmentum neurons within the ventral oral pontine tegmentum.,0
The hypoactivity of this system supports the sleep cycle fragmentation and general disorganization appearing in narcolepsy as well as momentary interruption of wakefulness by REM sleep episodes.,1
Orexins (also known as hypocretins) play critical roles in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness states by activating two G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) orexin 1 (OX1R) and orexin 2 receptors (OX2R).,0
In order to understand the differential contribution of both receptors in regulating sleep/wakefulness states we compared the pharmacological effects of a newly developed OX2R antagonist (2-SORA) Compound 1 m (C1 m) with those of a dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) suvorexant in C57BL/6J mice.,1
After oral administration in the dark period both C1m and suvorexant decreased wakefulness time with similar efficacy in a dose-dependent manner.,0
While C1m primarily increased total non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep time without affecting episode durations and with minimal effects on REM sleep suvorexant increased both total NREM and REM sleep time and episode durations with predominant effects on REM sleep.,0
Fos-immunostaining showed that both compounds affected the activities of arousal-related neurons with different patterns.,0
The number of Fos-IR noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus was lower in the suvorexant group as compared with the control and C1m-treated groups.,0
In contrast the numbers of Fos-IR neurons in histaminergic neurons in the tuberomamillary nucleus and serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe were reduced to a similar extent in the suvorexant and C1m groups as compared with the vehicle-treated group.,0
Together these results suggest that an orexin-mediated suppression of REM sleep via potential activation of OX1Rs in the locus coeruleus may possibly contribute to the differential effects on sleep/wakefulness exerted by a DORA as compared to a 2-SORA.,1
Tricyclic antidepressants decrease rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and may suppress sleep atonia.,0
Reports indicate that these agents can induce visual hallucinations sometimes characterized as hypnopompic or associated with a dissociated sleep-wakefulness state.,1
In addition disturbing dreams and confusional states were reported during clinical trials and in subsequent studies.,0
To our knowledge only two cases of nightmares associated with mirtazapine a tetracyclic antidepressant have been previously reported.,0
We describe a 43-year-old Caucasian man with major depressive disorder who started mirtazapine 15 mg at bedtime because he had poor symptom control with other antidepressant drugs.,0
Three days later vivid dream activity was noted evolving into realistic nightmares that the patient was not able to distinguish from reality on awakening.,0
Acute paranoia was suspected and haloperidol was started.,0
The dream activity then ended and within 3 days the patient was able to identify the dreams as unreality.,0
Haloperidol was discontinued but mirtazapine was continued and the vivid dream activity persisted; however reality testing when awake was intact.,0
A short course of haloperidol restored the patient's reality testing and mirtazapine was eventually replaced with bupropion.,0
The unusual nocturnal activity resolved as a result.,0
Clinicians should be aware of the possible transition from exceptionally vivid dreams to REM sleep behavior disorder and psychosis based on dream content as an adverse effect of mirtazapine.,1
Optogenetics is a recently developed experimental technique to control the activity of neurons using light.,0
Optogenetics shows its power to reveal the physiological role of specific neural circuits in the brain.,0
In particular manipulation of a specific type of neurons using optogenetics with high accuracy timing enables us to analyze causality between neural activity and initiation of animal behaviors.,0
However to manipulate the activity of specific neurons in vivo there are two critical steps to succeed in manipulation of the neural activity and control of the behavior of individual animals.,0
The first step is an adequate number of molecules of light-activated protein that has to be expressed in the cell membrane of the neurons of interest.,0
The second step is the optical system to illuminate the targeted neurons with enough intensity of light to activate the light-activated protein.,0
We applied optogenetics to hypothalamic peptidergic neurons such as orexin/hypocretin neurons or melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons.,1
These neurons are implicated in sleep/wakefulness regulation.,0
In this mini review I will show the regulatory mechanism of sleep/wakefulness by these neurons using optogenetics.,1
The state of sleep/wakefulness is well known to influence esophageal acid exposure and the number of acid refluxes whereas it is uncertain whether the same is true of the non-acid refluxes that predominate in the newborns.,0
To investigate the relationship between sleep/wakefulness and refluxes 45 newborns with gastroesophageal reflux symptoms were studied with combined multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH monitoring.,1
We found that sleep/wakefulness influenced acid and weakly acidic reflux frequency (awake 2.6+/-0.8; asleep 2.1+/-1.1; p=0.006).,0
A negative correlation was found between sleepness periods and the mean reflux duration for both acid (R=0.55;p < 0.001) and weackly acidic (R=0.51;p < 0.001) refluxes.,0
This finding may raise some concerns about the over-prescription of antacid drugs in newborns.,0
BACKGROUND: Peak sound levels during sleep can compromise the development of hospitalized infants.,0
Quiet time is a strategy implemented in neonatal units to promote the sleeping of neonates by reducing noise levels luminosity and handling during particular periods of the day.,0
PURPOSE: To determine the impact of quiet time on reducing sound levels and increasing total sleep time.,1
METHODS: This longitudinal study was conducted at a neonatal intermediate care unit with a convenience sample of 12 premature infants.,0
Four times per day 60-minute quiet times were provided in the neonatal unit.,0
Sleep-awake states and sound levels were evaluated during quiet times as well as 60 minutes before and afterward.,0
Polysomnography was used for sleep-awake state assessment and a noise dosimeter was used to check sound levels every 24 hours.,0
RESULTS: The preterm infants had a corrected gestational age of 35.0 +/- 1.5 weeks and weighed 1606.0 +/- 317.8 g. Total sleep time was highest during quiet time (P = .005).,0
Premature infants remained awake for longer following quiet times (P = .005).,0
There was also a reduction in sound level during quiet times compared with the other time frames (P = .006).,0
No statistically significant relationship was found between total sleep time and sound levels more than 24 hours.,0
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Quiet time is a nursing intervention that should be implemented in all neonatal units.,0
IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Future research should use a greater sample size and other factors that influence sleep should be further investigated.,1
The structure morphological and neurochemical bindings ofhistaminergic system of the brain as one of the most important mechanisms of waking maintenance are regarded.,0
The biochemistry of histamine turnover and histamine receptors are briefly described.,0
The special role of the relation between histamine and orexin/hypocretin systems is stressed.,0
Some examples of the responses on wakefulness-sleep cycle of the effects of experimental manipulations with the histaminergic system are given.,1
Hypocretinergic/orexinergic neurons which are known to be implicated in narcolepsy project to the pontine tegmentum areas involved in the control of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.,0
Here we report the effects on sleep-wakefulness produced by low-volume microinjections of hypocretin (Hcrt)1 (20-30 nL 100 500 and 1000 microm) and carbachol (20-30 nL 0.1 m) delivered in two areas of the oral pontine tegmentum of free-moving cats with electrodes for chronic sleep recordings: in the dorsal oral pontine tegmentum (DOPT) and in the ventral part of the oral pontine reticular nucleus (vRPO).,1
Carbachol in the DOPT produced dissociate polygraphic states with some but not all REM sleep signs.,0
In contrast carbachol in the vRPO produced a shift with short latency from wakefulness (W) to REM sleep with all of its polygraphic and behavioral signs.,0
Hcrt-1 in the DOPT increased W and decreased both slow-wave sleep (SWS) and REM sleep during the first 3 h post-drug.,0
The same doses of Hcr-1 in the vRPO produced a significant suppression of REM sleep without a definitive trend for changes in the other states.,0
Both groups showed significant decreases in the number of transitions from SWS to REM sleep.,0
Thus Hcrt-1 produced distinct effects in cholinoceptive areas of the oral pontine tegmentum; in the DOPT it promoted W suppressed SWS and probably defacilitated REM sleep and in the vRPO it directly inhibited REM sleep.,0
Hypocretinergic/orexinergic signaling is lost in narcoleptics and this absence would mean that pontine defacilitation/inhibition of REM sleep would also be absent explaining why these patients can fall directly into REM sleep from W.,0
Orexin A and orexin B are hypothalamic neuropeptides that play critical roles in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness as well as in a variety of physiological functions such as emotion reward and energy homeostasis.,1
The actions of orexins are mediated by two receptors orexin 1 (OX1R) and orexin 2 (OX2R) receptors.,0
OX1R and OX2R show partly overlapping but distinct distributions throughout the central nervous system suggesting their differential roles.,0
This review presents and discusses the current knowledge concerning the physiological roles of each orexin receptor subtype focusing on the regulation of sleep/wakefulness.,1
The hypothalamus monitors body homeostasis and regulates various behaviors such as feeding thermogenesis and sleeping.,0
Orexins (also known as hypocretins) were identified as endogenous ligands for two orphan G-protein-coupled receptors in the lateral hypothalamic area.,0
They were initially recognized as regulators of feeding behavior but they are mainly regarded as key modulators of the sleep/wakefulness cycle.,1
Orexins activate orexin neurons monoaminergic and cholinergic neurons in the hypothalamus/brainstem regions to maintain a long consolidated awake period.,0
Anatomical studies of neural projections from/to orexin neurons and phenotypic characterization of transgenic mice revealed various roles for orexin neurons in the coordination of emotion energy homeostasis reward system and arousal.,0
For example orexin neurons are regulated by peripheral metabolic cues including ghrelin leptin and glucose concentration.,0
This suggests that they may provide a link between energy homeostasis and arousal states.,0
A link between the limbic system and orexin neurons might be important for increasing vigilance during emotional stimuli.,0
Orexins are also involved in reward systems and the mechanisms of drug addiction.,0
These findings suggest that orexin neurons sense the outer and inner environment of the body and maintain the proper wakefulness level of animals for survival.,0
This review discusses the mechanism by which orexins maintain sleep/wakefulness states and how this mechanism relates to other systems that regulate emotion reward and energy homeostasis.,1
Seizures can evolve sequentially into different clinical phases.,0
For example a seizure may start as an aura (first phase) then evolve into a tonic seizure (second phase) and evolve further into a generalized tonic-clonic semiology (third phase).,0
It is currently unknown whether specific seizure evolutions cluster at particular times of the day and/or during sleep/wakefulness.,0
We aimed to describe the distribution of the clinical evolution of seizures across time of day and sleep/wake state.,1
We included all patients with at least two seizure phases admitted for long-term electroencephalogram monitoring during a 5 year period.,0
Two-hundred-and-fifteen patients (866 seizures) presented with two different phases and 87 patients (324 seizures) evolved into a third clinical phase.,0
During phase two evolution into clonic seizures differed across time (p = 0.047) with peaks at 0-3 h and 6-9 h and during sleep (p < 0.001) evolution into automotor seizures peaked during wakefulness (p = 0.015) evolution into tonic seizures differed across time (p = 0.005) with peaks at 21-12 h and during sleep (p = 0.0119) and generalized tonic-clonic seizures peaked during sleep (p = 0.0067).,0
Findings remained statistically significant after multivariable analysis adjusting separately for potential confounders (semiology of the first phase age gender days in the long-term electroencephalographic monitoring unit abnormal neuroimaging number of antiepileptic medications and seizure localization).,0
During phase three seizure evolutions followed the same pattern of distribution as during phase two but differences did not reach statistical significance.,0
Our data demonstrate that the evolution of seizures into different phases cluster at specific times of day and at specific phases of the sleep/wakefulness cycle.,1
Novel findings on the effects of inflammatory molecules on neuronal circuits and on molecular interactions between immunity and sleep in health and disease shed light on the pathogenesis of disorders of past (encephalitis lethargica) and present concern (human African trypanosomiasis and narcolepsy) which share alterations in sleep-wakefulness transitions.,0
Although these three disorders differ in etiology synaptic interactions with immune-response-derived molecules could play a pathogenetic role.,0
Knowledge obtained on neural-immune interplay during senescence also has implications for age-related sleep dysregulation which is common in the elderly population.,0
Altogether the data indicate that cell groups implicated in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness circadian timing and their interactions could be sensitive to synaptic effects of immune molecules.,1
INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The incidence of cardiovascular events is related to the sleep-wakefulness cycle.,0
In particular the magnitude and speed of the changes in hemodynamic variables that occur during transitions between wakefulness and sleep and between sleep and wakefulness are regarded as factors that either predict or determine target organ damage and cardiovascular risk.,1
Although increased arterial stiffness (AS) is associated with the development of cardiovascular abnormalities it is not known whether there exist any changes in AS that are associated with circadian variations in the incidence of cardiovascular events.,0
The aims of this study were to assess AS in healthy subjects over a 24-hour period to characterize any differences that occur between sleep and wakefulness and to investigate any changes in AS that occur during the transition from wakefulness to sleep or from sleep to wakefulness.,1
METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers with a dipper circadian blood pressure pattern underwent 24-hour ambulatory monitoring of blood pressure heart rate and AS.,0
In practice AS was determined using the aorta-brachial pulse transit time and fractional pulsatility indices.,0
Myocardial oxygen consumption was quantified using the double product (DP).,0
An average was calculated for all variables for periods of sleep (23:00 to 06:00) and wakefulness (8:00 to 21:00) and for transitions from wakefulness to sleep (20:00 vs. 02:00) and from sleep to wakefulness (06:00 vs. 10:00 hours).,0
RESULTS: In complete contrast to DP AS was greater during sleep than wakefulness (P< .05).,0
Moreover the changes in AS that occurred during transitions from wakefulness to sleep and from sleep to wakefulness were the opposite of those observed in DP (P< .05).,0
CONCLUSIONS: Arterial stiffness was greater during sleep than wakefulness increased during the transition from wakefulness to sleep and decreased during the transition from sleep to wakefulness.,1
Several neuropeptides including galanin orexin melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) urocortin-2 pituitary adenylate cyclase activating protein and vasoactive intestinal peptide have been implicated in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness states.,0
In particular neuropeptides produced in the hypothalamus including galanin orexin and MCH have been shown to play crucial roles.,0
Galanin is localized to the prepotic area of the hypothalamus and is likely to be involved in the promotion and maintenance of sleep.,1
MCH which is expressed by neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) seems to be implicated in rapid eye movement sleep regulation.,0
Orexins are also localized in the LHA and have been established as one of the most important factors in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness states.,0
A series of studies have suggested that orexin deficiency causes narcolepsy in humans and other mammalian species highlighting the roles of this hypothalamic neuropeptide in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness.,1
Studies of efferent and afferent systems of orexin-producing neurons have shown that the orexin neuronal system has close interactions with the systems that regulate emotion energy homeostasis reward and arousal.,0
These observations suggest that orexin neurons are involved in sensing the body's external and internal environments and regulate vigilance states accordingly.,0
Fluctuations in sleep/wake state have been proposed as an important mechanism contributing to the development of oscillatory breathing patterns including Cheyne-Stokes respiration in patients with heart failure.,0
In order to properly assess the interactions between changes in state and changes in ventilatory parameters a methodology capable of continuously and reliably detecting state transitions is needed.,0
Traditional fixed-epoch analysis of polysomnographic recordings is not suitable for this purpose.,0
Moreover visual identification of changes in the dominant electroencephalogram activity at the transition from wakefulness to sleep and vice versa is often very subjective.,1
We have therefore developed a hybrid approach--including both visual scoring and computer-based procedures--for continuous analysis of state transitions from polysomnographic recordings specifically tailored for fluctuations between wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement-1 and -2 sleep.,0
The overall analysis process comprises three major phases: (1) manual identification of relevant electroencephalogram/electrooculogram features and events including a sample of unequivocal alpha and theta-delta activity; (2) automatic statistical discrimination of dominant electroencephalogram activity; and (3) state classification (wakefulness non-rapid eye movement-1 and -2).,1
The latter is carried out by merging information from visual scoring with the output of the discriminator.,0
Validation has been carried out in 16 patients with heart failure during daytime Cheyne-Stokes respiration using a training and testing set of electroencephalogram polysomnograms.,0
The statistical discriminator correctly classified 99.1 +/- 1.4% and 99.2 +/- 1.1% of unequivocal alpha and theta-delta activity.,0
This approach has therefore the potential to be used to reliably measure the incidence and location of sleep-wake transitions during abnormal breathing patterns as well as their temporal relationship with major ventilatory events.,1
Brief anatomical physiological and neurochemical basics of the regulation of wakefulness slow wave (NREM) sleep and paradoxical (REM) sleep are regarded as representing by the end of the first decade of the second millennium.,1
The finding of orexin (hypocretin) deficiency in patients with narcolepsy suggests that this hypothalamic neuropeptide plays a crucial role in regulating and maintaining sleep/wakefulness states and energy homeostasis.,0
Orexin might be especially important for stabilization of behavioral states because the major symptom in narcolepsy is instability of each behavioral state which results in sleep/wakefulness fragmentation.,1
The efferent and afferent systems of orexin neurons suggest interactions between these cells and arousal/sleep-wakefulness centers in the brainstem as well as important feeding centers in the hypothalamus.,0
Electrophysiological studies have shown that orexin neurons are regulated by monoamines and acetylcholine as well as metabolic cues including leptin glucose and ghrelin.,0
Thus orexin neurons have the requisite functional interactions with hypothalamic feeding pathways and monoaminergic/cholinergic centers and provide a critical link between peripheral energy balance and the central mechanisms that coordinate sleep/wakefulness and motivated behavior such as food seeking.,0
It is not clear how the age-related changes in sleep are related to performance and subjective sleepiness at different time of the day.,0
The aim of the present study was to study work shift related interactions of age with sleep-wakefulness performance and social life.,1
A representative sample of aircraft maintenance workers in a continuous three-shift system was studied by a questionnaire (n = 275) and an on-site field (n = 49) study.,0
In the field study sleep length and quality and different ratings of social and other activities were studied with an actigraphy and a Pocket PC diary during 15 consecutive days.,0
Subjective sleepiness (KSS) and vigilance performance (PVT) were registered at work.,0
Although the shift type influenced the sleep subjective sleepiness performance and social life age was distinctly related only to shift-related changes in the amount of sleep subjective sleepiness and psychomotor vigilance.,0
Night shifts were related with shorter sleep decreased performance and increased sleepiness.,0
Although subjective sleepiness was greatest among the youngest (25-34 years) age group during the morning and the night shifts the increase of performance lapses was higher among the middle-aged (35-49 years) and senior (50-58 years) groups during the night shifts compared to the youngest age group.,0
According to the questionnaire older shiftworkers also tended to perceive more frequently that subjective sleepiness decreases their work performance during the morning and night shifts.,0
The results indicate of no direct link between age-related differences in subjective sleepiness and performance at night work.,1
The shorter day sleep after the night shifts and higher deterioration of subjective and objective performance according to age urge on development of shift schedules aiming at lower fatigue levels during the night shifts.,0
STUDY OBJECTIVES: This study tested the hypothesis that Regulators of G protein Signaling (RGS) proteins contribute to the regulation of wakefulness non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and to sleep disruption caused by volatile anesthetics.,1
METHODS: The three groups used in this study included wild-type (WT; n = 7) mice and knock-in mice that were heterozygous (+/GS; n = 7) or homozygous (GS/GS; n = 7) for an RGS-insensitive allele that causes prolonged Galphai2 signaling.,0
Mice were implanted with electrodes for recording sleep and conditioned for 1 week or more to sleep in the laboratory.,0
Using within and between groups designs 24-h recordings of wakefulness NREM sleep and REM sleep were compared across three interventions: (1) baseline (control) and after 3 h of being anesthetized with (2) isoflurane or (3) sevoflurane.,0
RESULTS: Baseline recordings during the light phase revealed that relative to WT mice homozygous RGS-insensitive (GS/GS) mice exhibit significantly increased wakefulness and decreased NREM and REM sleep.,0
During the dark phase these state-specific differences remained significant but reversed direction of change.,0
After cessation of isoflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia there was a long-lasting and significant disruption of sleep and wakefulness.,0
The durations of average episodes of wakefulness NREM sleep and REM sleep were significantly altered as a function of genotype and isoflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia.,0
CONCLUSIONS: RGS proteins and Galphai2 play a significant role in regulating states of wakefulness NREM sleep and REM sleep.,1
Genotype-specific differences demonstrate that RGS proteins modulate sleep disruption caused by isoflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia.,0
The results also support the conclusion that isoflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia do not satisfy the homeostatic drive for sleep.,0
The effects of the destruction of the medial septal neurons (MS) with N-methyl-d-aspartic acid on sleep-wakefulness (S-W) body temperature (Tb) locomotor activity (LMA) and thermal preference were studied in male Wistar rats.,1
When these rats were given a choice of three ambient temperatures (Tamb) of 24 27 and 30 degrees C they preferred 27 degrees C before the lesion.,0
But they chose 30 degrees C during the initial days and 24 degrees C by the third week after the MS lesion.,0
The MS lesion produced an increase in paradoxical sleep (PS) though this change was not very evident when the rats were not allowed to choose their Tamb.,0
Though there was a decrease in slow wave sleep (SWS) it recovered considerably when the lesioned rats chose their preferred Tamb.,0
However the frequency of SWS episodes did not show any recovery.,0
There was a decrease in both Tb and LMA by the third week after the MS lesion.,0
It can therefore be concluded that the MS lesion affected the initiation of SWS as there was a decrease in the frequency of SWS episodes.,1
Study of S-W in the rats that were given freedom to select Tamb helped to demonstrate the role of the MS in the inhibition of PS.,0
It also showed that the thermostat of the rats was reset at a lower level by the third week after the MS lesion.,0
Decrease in heat production resulting from a decrease in LMA could have contributed towards the animals' efforts to maintain a lower Tb.,0
Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) plays key roles in sleep-wakefulness regulation.,0
Evidence indicates that 5-HT2 receptors are involved mainly in non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) regulation and respiratory control.,0
Here we investigated the relative contribution of 5-HT(2A) 5-HT(2B) and 5-HT(2C) receptor subtypes to NREMS and breathing during sleep using 5-HT2 subtype-selective ligands in wild-type (5-HT(2A)+/+) and knock-out (5-HT(2A)-/-) mice that do not express 5-HT(2A) receptors.,1
Acute blockade of 5-HT(2A) receptors induced an increase in NREMS in 5-HT(2A)+/+ mice but not 5-HT(2A)-/- mutants which spontaneously expressed less NREMS than wild-type animals.,0
In 5-HT(2A)+/+ mice 5-HT(2B) receptor blockade produced a reduction of NREMS whereas receptor activation induced an increase in this sleep stage.,0
These effects were less pronounced in 5-HT(2A)-/- mice indicating a lower sensitivity of 5-HT(2B) receptors in mutants with no change in 5-HT(2B) mRNA.,0
Blockade of 5-HT(2C) receptors had no effect on NREMS in both strains.,0
In addition an increase in EEG power density after sleep deprivation was observed in 5-HT(2A)+/+ mice but not in 5-HT(2A)-/- mice.,0
Whole-body plethysmographic recordings indicated that 5-HT(2A) receptor blockade in 5-HT(2A)+/+ mice reduced NREMS apneas and bradypneas that occurred after sighs.,0
In contrast in 5-HT(2A)-/- mutants NREMS apneas were not modified and bradypnea after sighs were more pronounced.,0
Our results demonstrate that 5-HT exerts a 5-HT(2B)-mediated facilitation of NREMS and an influence respectively inhibitory on NREMS and facilitatory on sleep apnea generation via 5-HT(2A) receptors.,1
Moreover 5-HT(2A) gene knock-out leads to functional compensations yielding adaptive changes opposite to those caused by pharmacological blockade of 5-HT(2A) receptors in 5-HT(2A)+/+ mice.,0
Many aspects of brain function are influenced by modulatory processes including arousal.,0
The most abrupt changes in arousal occur at the wake-sleep transition and at the induction of anesthetic conditions.,0
They are accompanied by major electrophysiological changes including an emergence of low-frequency (sleep-like) activity and a loss of mid-frequency (wake-like) activity that has been linked to feedback processes of the brain.,1
Nevertheless the causal relationship between these two types of electrophysiological changes as well as the cortical mechanisms underlying changes in arousal and consciousness remain poorly understood.,1
To address this we studied spontaneous electro-cortical activity during arousal changes in macaques.,0
During sleep and at loss of consciousness induced by propofol anesthesia we identified a prototypical sequence of cortical events in which the loss of mid-frequency activity preceded by seconds the increases in low-frequency activity.,0
Furthermore in visual areas an influence of mid-frequency change onto high-frequency activity was observed across visual hierarchy.,0
These results are consistent with the notion that drops in arousal and consciousness are facilitated by a release of feedback cortical inhibition.,1
Several pieces of evidence suggest that the noradrenergic afferents in the medial preoptic area produce sleep and hypothermia by acting on alphal adrenergic receptors.,0
On the other hand in a few studies monitoring body temperature with a rectal probe preoptic injection of the alphal adrenergic agonist methoxamine produced contradictory changes in body temperature and sleep-wakefulness.,1
Such contradictions call for the re-examination of methoxamine induced body temperature changes using a better technique like telemetric recording.,0
In the present study we monitored body temperature and sleep-wakefulness simultaneously after the micro-injection of 0.5 1 and 2 micromol methoxamine into the medial preoptic area of adult male Wistar rats.,1
Methoxamine injection produced hypothermia but no major change in sleep-wakefulness during the 3 hours after drug injection except for a short period (15 min) of sleep after 120 min of injection.,0
A short period of wakefulness coinciding with the maximum fall in body temperature (30 min after injection) occurred when methoxamine was administered at higher doses.,1
The results of this study indicate that alphal adrenergic receptors participate in preoptically mediated thermoregulatory measures that reduce body temperature.,0
Hypothermia induced by methoxamine might have masked the hypnogenic action of this drug.,0
