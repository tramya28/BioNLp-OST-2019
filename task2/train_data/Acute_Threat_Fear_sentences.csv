OBJECTIVE: Life-threatening danger is assumed to produce in tandem increases in both vigilance toward threat and stress-related symptoms but no data test the validity of this assumption.,1
The authors examined associations in real time among imminent life-threatening danger stress-related symptoms and vigilance.,1
METHOD: Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) depression and anxiety were measured in a civilian population (N=131) as a function of war-related stress operationalized as the time available for seeking cover from rocket attack.,0
A computerized measure of threat-related vigilance using a classic dot-probe attention task was also collected.,1
RESULTS: PTSD symptoms depression and anxiety increased as a function of war-related threat.,0
Acute proximal threat was associated with avoidance of rather than vigilance toward negative valence information.,0
For participants within rocket range the magnitude of threat bias varied with the magnitude of distress symptoms such that as bias away from threat increased distress symptoms increased.,1
CONCLUSIONS: These data challenge current thinking about the role of attention in stress responding.,0
Attentional threat avoidance may reduce the acute impact of imminent threat but this may come at a price in terms of an elevated risk for psychopathology.,1
Learned safety a learning process in which a cue becomes associated with the absence of threat is disrupted in individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).,0
A bi-directional relationship exists between smoking and PTSD and one potential explanation is that nicotine-associated changes in cognition facilitate PTSD emotional dysregulation by disrupting safety associations.,0
Therefore we investigated whether nicotine would disrupt learned safety by enhancing fear associated with a safety cue.,1
In the present study C57BL/6 mice were administered acute or chronic nicotine and trained over three days in a differential backward trace conditioning paradigm consisting of five trials of a forward conditioned stimulus (CS)+ (Light) co-terminating with a footshock unconditioned stimulus followed by a backward CS- (Tone) presented 20 s after cessation of the unconditioned stimulus.,1
Summation testing found that acute nicotine disrupted learned safety but chronic nicotine had no effect.,0
Another group of animals administered acute nicotine showed fear when presented with the backward CS (Light) alone indicating the formation of a maladaptive fear association with the backward CS.,1
Finally we investigated the brain regions involved by administering nicotine directly into the dorsal hippocampus ventral hippocampus and prelimbic cortex.,1
Infusion of nicotine into the dorsal hippocampus disrupted safety learning.,0
There is mounting evidence that single administrations of glucocorticoids may acutely reduce human fear.,0
We previously reported that administration of cortisol acutely reduced non-spatial selective attention to fearful faces and likewise reduced preferential processing of fearful faces in a spatial working memory task.,1
Here we report the acute effects of 40 mg cortisol (administered in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design) on a different experimental task for measuring threat-selective attention.,1
Twenty healthy young males had to localize a target which was presented in a peripheral location that was either gazed at or not by a preceding dynamic happy or fearful face.,0
This reliable method has been used repeatedly to demonstrate fear-driven selective attention.,1
Present results showed that after placebo as usual the fearful gaze cues caused stronger orienting of attention than happy faces.,0
Cortisol abolished this typical anxious response pattern but only in low anxious participants.,0
These data provide evidence that cortisol acutely influences also spatial threat-selective attention.,0
Possible neuroendocrine mechanisms are discussed.,0
Although the long-acting opiate methadone is commonly used to treat drug addiction relatively little is known about the effects of withdrawal from this drug in preclinical models.,0
The current study examined affective neuroendocrine and somatic signs of withdrawal from the longer-acting methadone derivative l-alpha-acetylmethydol (LAAM) in rats.,0
Anxiety-like behavior during both spontaneous and antagonist-precipitated withdrawal was measured by potentiation of the startle reflex.,1
Withdrawal elevated corticosterone and somatic signs and blunted circadian variations in baseline startle responding.,0
In addition fear to an explicit Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (fear-potentiated startle) was enhanced.,1
These data suggest that anxiety-like behavior as measured using potentiated startle responding does not emerge spontaneously during withdrawal from chronic opiate exposure - in contrast to withdrawal from acute drug exposure - but rather is manifested as exaggerated fear in response to explicit threat cues.,1
Late-latency auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials are sensitive to some centrally acting drugs and to certain psychological interventions.,0
In this experiment we compared the effects of acute doses of a benzodiazepine diazepam and an H(1) histamine receptor-blocking sedative diphenhydramine on auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials within the latency range 100-500 ms in a fear conditioning paradigm.,1
Twelve healthy males (18-30 years) participated in three sessions at weekly intervals in which they received diazepam 10mg diphenhydramine 75 mg and placebo in a balanced double-blind crossover protocol.,0
One hundred and twenty min after diphenhydramine or 60 min after diazepam they underwent an 8 min recording period in which auditory evoked potentials elicited by 40 ms 95 dB[A] 1 kHz tones and somatosensory evoked potentials elicited by a mildly painful electric shock (1.8 mA 50 ms) were recorded at Cz (vertex).,1
Each session consisted of four blocks of trials in which either the sound pulse or the shock was presented.,0
Alternate blocks were designated SAFE or THREAT ('context' conditions); in THREAT blocks subjects were warned that shocks would be delivered via electrodes placed on the wrist (electrodes were removed during SAFE blocks).,0
In one SAFE and one THREAT block the sound stimuli and shocks (shocks were delivered only in the THREAT block) were preceded by a 2 s conditioned stimulus (CS: a red light) ('cue' condition).,0
Diazepam but not diphenhydramine reduced the amplitude of the P2 auditory evoked potential.,0
The THREAT context was associated with increased N1 and reduced N2 potential amplitudes.,0
The CS had no effect on the amplitudes but markedly reduced the latencies of the N1 P2 and N2 potentials under the THREAT condition.,0
Diazepam reduced the amplitudes of the somatosensory potential evoked by the shock; the CS shortened the latencies of the later components of the response.,0
Diazepam and diphenhydramine were approximately equi-sedative in the doses used in this experiment as judged by visual analogue self-rating scales.,0
The results indicate that the suppression of late-latency auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials by diazepam is not simply a reflection of sedation.,0
Late-latency evoked potentials can be modified by an aversive CS but the components that are sensitive to the CS are different from those that are sensitive to diazepam.,0
BACKGROUND: Recent laboratory studies have shown that acute alcohol intoxication selectively and effectively dampens aversive responding to uncertain threat.,0
An emerging hypothesis is that individuals who exhibit heightened reactivity to uncertain threat may be especially motivated to use alcohol to dampen their distress setting the stage for negative reinforcement processes to drive excessive alcohol use.,1
However no study to date has directly examined whether current problematic drinkers exhibit heightened reactivity to uncertain threat as would be expected.,1
METHODS: The present study was therefore designed to examine the association between current problematic alcohol use and reactivity to uncertain threat during sobriety in two independent samples.,1
In Study 1 (n=221) and Study 2 (n=74) adult participants completed the same well-validated threat-of-shock task which separately probes responses to temporally predictable and unpredictable threat.,1
Startle potentiation was measured as an index of aversive responding.,0
Problematic alcohol use was defined as number of binge episodes within the past 30days in Study 1 and total scores on a self-report measure of hazardous drinking in Study 2.,0
RESULTS: As hypothesized across both studies greater levels of problematic drinking were associated with greater startle potentiation to unpredictable threat.,1
In Study 2 hazardous drinking scores were also positively associated with startle potentiation to predictable threat.,0
CONCLUSIONS: The findings are notably consistent with the notion that heightened reactivity to uncertain threat is an important individual difference factor associated with the onset and/or maintenance of problematic drinking behaviors and may therefore be a novel prevention and intervention target.,1
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has in some cases been associated with significant psychological effects and/or personality change.,0
These effects occur sometimes as acute changes experienced intraoperatively or during the initial setting of the stimulator and sometimes as longer term progressive changes in the months following surgery.,0
Sometimes they are the intended outcome of treatment and in other cases they are an unintended side-effect.,0
In all of these circumstances some patients and caregivers have described the psychological effects of DBS as frightening or disconcerting.,0
I trace the source of these negative reactions to the fear that stimulation-related psychological and personality changes represent a threat to personal identity and agency.,1
This issue has implications both for philosophical theories of personal identity and agency and for clinical concerns.,0
A narrative account of personal identity is developed to illuminate the nature of the threat to identity and agency DBS potentially poses and to suggest steps that might be taken to mitigate and avoid these threats.,1
Peritraumatic responses aside from dissociation have been understudied in acute trauma populations.,0
Participants were 172 female rape 68 assault and 80 robbery victims recruited through formal reporting agencies and assessed 1 month after the crime.,0
Despite substantial overlap across crimes rape victims reported more emotional responses reflecting fear detachment shame and more nonactive behavioral responses.,1
Regression analysis examining the prediction of perceived threat by peritraumatic responses and crime variables indicated that increased duration of crimes; decreased calmness; increased fear; numbing; use of begging pleading and crying; and attempts to reason with the perpetrator(s) were all significantly associated with increased appraisal of threat.,1
Excessive stress exposure often leads to emotional dysfunction characterized by disruptions in healthy emotional learning expression and regulation processes.,0
A prefrontal cortex (PFC)-amygdala circuit appears to underlie these important emotional processes.,0
However limited human neuroimaging research has investigated whether these brain regions underlie the altered emotional function that develops with stress.,0
Therefore the present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate stress-induced changes in PFC-amygdala function during Pavlovian fear conditioning.,1
Participants completed a variant of the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST) followed (25min later) by a Pavlovian fear conditioning task during fMRI.,0
Self-reported stress to the MIST was used to identify three stress-reactivity groups (Low Medium and High).,0
Psychophysiological behavioral and fMRI signal responses were compared between the three stress-reactivity groups during fear conditioning.,0
Fear learning indexed via participant expectation of the unconditioned stimulus during conditioning increased with stress reactivity.,0
Further the High stress-reactivity group demonstrated greater autonomic arousal (i.e. skin conductance response SCR) to both conditioned and unconditioned stimuli compared to the Low and Medium stress-reactivity groups.,1
Finally the High stress group did not regulate the emotional response to threat.,0
More specifically the High stress-reactivity group did not show a negative relationship between conditioned and unconditioned SCRs.,0
Stress-induced changes in these emotional processes paralleled changes in dorsolateral dorsomedial and ventromedial PFC function.,0
These findings demonstrate that acute stress facilitates fear learning enhances autonomic arousal and impairs emotion regulation and suggests these stress-induced changes in emotional function are mediated by the PFC.,1
BACKGROUND: Leukemia and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) create physical psychological social and spiritual distresses in patients.,0
Understanding this threatening situation in adults with leukemia undergoing HSCT will assist health care professionals in providing holistic care to the patients.,0
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was exploring the perceived threat in adults with leukemia undergoing HSCT.,1
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This article is part of a longitudinal qualitative study which used the grounded theory approach and was conducted in 2009-2011.,0
Ten adults with acute leukemia scheduled for HSCT were recruited from the Hematology-Oncology Research Center and Stem Cell Transplantation Shariati Hospital in Tehran Iran.,0
A series of pre-transplant and post-transplant in-depth interviews were held in the hospital's HSCT wards.,0
Totally 18 interviews were conducted.,0
Three written narratives were also obtained from the participants.,0
The Corbin and Strauss approach was used to analyze the data.,0
RESULTS: Perceived threat was one of the main categories that emerged from the data.,0
This category included four subcategories inattention to the signs and symptoms doubt and anxiety perception of danger and time limitation and change of life conditions which occurred in linear progression over time.,1
CONCLUSION: Suffering from leukemia and experiencing HSCT are events that are uniquely perceived by patients.,0
This threatening situation can significantly effect perception of patients and cause temporary or permanent alterations in patients' lives.,0
Health care professionals can help these patients by deeper understanding of their experiences and effective interventions.,0
This study examined the effects of oral administration of 20mg hydrocortisone on baseline and fear-potentiated startle in 63 male veterans with or without PTSD.,1
The procedure was based on a two-session within-subject design in which acoustic startle eyeblink responses were recorded during intervals of threat or no threat of electric shock.,1
Results showed that the magnitude of the difference between startle responses recorded during anticipation of imminent shock compared to safe periods was reduced after hydrocortisone administration relative to placebo.,1
This effect did not vary as a function of PTSD group nor were there were any significant group differences in other indices startle amplitude.,0
Findings suggest that the acute elevations in systemic cortisol produced by hydrocortisone administration may have fear-inhibiting effects.,1
This finding may have implications for understanding the role of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis function in vulnerability and resilience to traumatic stress.,1
Two things are worth remembering about an aversive event: What made it happen?,0
What made it cease?,0
If a stimulus precedes an aversive event it becomes a signal for threat and will later elicit behavior indicating conditioned fear.,0
However if the stimulus is presented upon cessation of the aversive event it elicits behavior indicating conditioned relief.,0
What are the neuronal bases for such learning?,0
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans we found that a fear-conditioned stimulus activates amygdala but not striatum whereas a relief-conditioned stimulus activates striatum but not amygdala.,1
Correspondingly acute inactivation of amygdala or of ventral striatum in rats respectively abolished only conditioned fear or only conditioned relief.,1
Thus the behaviorally opponent memories supported by onset and offset of aversive events engage and require fear and reward networks respectively.,0
This may explain attraction to stimuli associated with the cessation of trauma or of panic attacks.,0
Serotonin is strongly implicated in the mammalian stress response but surprisingly little is known about its mode of action.,0
Recent data suggest that serotonin can inhibit aversive responding in humans but this remains underspecified.,0
In particular data in rodents suggest that global serotonin depletion may specifically increase long-duration bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)-mediated aversive responses (ie anxiety) but not short-duration BNST-independent responses (ie fear).,1
Here we extend these findings to humans.,0
In a balanced placebo-controlled crossover design healthy volunteers (n=20) received a controlled diet with and without the serotonin precursor tryptophan (acute tryptophan depletion; ATD).,0
Aversive states were indexed by translational acoustic startle measures.,0
Fear and anxiety were operationally defined as the increase in startle reactivity during short- and long-duration threat periods evoked by predictable shock (fear-potentiated startle) and by the context in which the shocks were administered (anxiety-potentiated startle) respectively.,1
ATD significantly increased long-duration anxiety-potentiated startle but had no effect on short-duration fear-potentiated startle.,1
These results suggest that serotonin depletion in humans selectively increases anxiety but not fear.,0
Current translational frameworks support the proposition that ATD thus disinhibits dorsal raphe-originating serotonergic control of corticotropin-releasing hormone-mediated excitation of the BNST.,0
This generates a candidate neuropharmacological mechanism by which depleted serotonin may increase response to sustained threats alongside clear implications for our understanding of the manifestation and treatment of mood and anxiety disorders.,0
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with dysfunction of the neural circuitry that supports fear learning and memory processes.,0
However much of what is known about neural dysfunction in PTSD is based on research in chronic PTSD populations.,0
Less is known about neural function that supports fear learning acutely following trauma exposure.,0
Determining the acute effects of trauma exposure on brain function would provide new insight into the neural processes that mediate the cognitive-affective dysfunction associated with PTSD.,1
Therefore the present study investigated neural activity that supports fear learning and memory processes in recently Trauma-Exposed (TE) and Non-Trauma-Exposed (NTE) participants.,1
Participants completed a Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).,1
During fMRI participants' threat expectancy was continuously monitored.,0
NTE participants showed greater threat expectancy during warning than safety cues while no difference was observed in the TE group.,0
This finding suggests TE participants overgeneralized the fear association to the safety cue.,0
Further only the TE group showed a negative relationship between fMRI signal responses within dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and threat expectancy during safety cues.,1
These results suggest the dorsomedial PFC mediates overgeneralization of learned fear as an acute result of trauma exposure.,0
Finally neural activity within the PFC and inferior parietal lobule showed a negative relationship with PTSD symptom severity assessed three months posttrauma.,0
Thus neural activity measured acutely following trauma exposure predicted future PTSD symptom severity.,1
The present findings elucidate the acute effects of trauma exposure on cognitive-affective function and provide new insight into the neural mechanisms of PTSD.,1
As a step toward addressing limitations in the current psychiatric diagnostic system the National Institute of Mental Health recently developed the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to stimulate integrative research-spanning self-report behavior neural circuitry and molecular/genetic mechanisms-on core psychological processes implicated in mental illness.,0
Here we use the RDoC conceptualization to review research on threat responses reward processing and their interaction.,1
The first section of the manuscript highlights the pivotal role of exaggerated threat responses-mediated by circuits connecting the frontal cortex amygdala and midbrain-in anxiety and reviews data indicating that genotypic variation in the serotonin system is associated with hyperactivity in this circuitry which elevates the risk for anxiety and mood disorders.,1
In the second section we describe mounting evidence linking anhedonic behavior to deficits in psychological functions that rely heavily on dopamine signaling especially cost/benefit decision making and reward learning.,0
The third section covers recent studies that document negative effects of acute threats and chronic stress on reward responses in humans.,1
The mechanisms underlying such effects are unclear but the fourth section reviews new optogenetic data in rodents indicating that GABAergic inhibition of midbrain dopamine neurons driven by activation of the habenula may play a fundamental role in stress-induced anhedonia.,0
In addition to its basic scientific value a better understanding of interactions between the neural systems that mediate threat and reward responses may offer relief from the burdensome condition of anxious depression.,1
In today's world mass-media and online social networks present us with unprecedented exposure to second-hand vicarious experiences and thereby the chance of forming associations between previously innocuous events (e.g. being in a subway station) and aversive outcomes (e.g. footage or verbal reports from a violent terrorist attack) without direct experience.,0
Such social threat or fear learning can have dramatic consequences as manifested in acute stress symptoms and maladaptive fears.,1
However most research has so far focused on socially acquired threat responses that are expressed as increased arousal rather than active behavior.,0
In three experiments (n = 120) we examined the effect of indirect experiences on behaviors by establishing a link between social threat learning and instrumental decision making.,0
We contrasted learning from direct experience (i.e. Pavlovian conditioning) (experiment 1) against two common forms of social threat learning-social observation (experiment 2) and verbal instruction (experiment 3)-and how this learning transferred to subsequent instrumental decision making using behavioral experiments and computational modeling.,1
We found that both types of social threat learning transfer to decision making in a strong and surprisingly inflexible manner.,1
Notably computational modeling indicated that the transfer of observational and instructed threat learning involved different computational mechanisms.,0
Our results demonstrate the strong influence of others' expressions of fear on one's own decisions and have important implications for understanding both healthy and pathological human behaviors resulting from the indirect exposure to threatening events.,0
Cognitive theories of anxiety psychopathology cite biased attention towards threat as a central vulnerability and maintaining factor.,0
However many studies have found threat bias indices to have poor reliability and have failed to observe the theorized relationship between threat bias and anxiety symptoms; this may be due to the non-unitary nature of threat bias and the influence of state-level variables on its expression.,1
Accumulating data suggests that state anxious mood is important for the robust expression of threat bias and for relations to emerge between threat bias and symptoms though this possibility has not been experimentally tested.,0
Eye-tracking was used to assess multiple forms of threat bias (i.e. early vigilance sustained attention facilitated engagement delayed disengagement) thought to be related to anxiety.,1
A non-clinical sample (N = 165) was recruited to test the hypothesis that biased attention towards threat but not dysphoric or positive emotional stimuli during an anxious mood induction but not at a pre-stress baseline would prospectively predict greater worry symptoms on days in which more naturalistic stressors occurred.,1
Results revealed the hypothesized moderation effect for sustained attention towards threat after the mood induction but not at baseline though sustained attention towards dysphoric stimuli also moderated the effect of stressors on worry.,0
Worry-relevant sustained attention towards negative emotional stimuli may be a partially mood-context dependent phenomenon.,1
The behavioral analysis of laboratory rats is usually confined to the level of overt behavior like locomotion behavioral inhibition instrumental responses and others.,0
Apart from such visible outcome however behaviorally relevant information can also be obtained when analyzing the animals' ultrasonic vocalization which is typically emitted in highly motivational situations like 22-kHz calls in response to acute or conditioned threat.,1
To further investigate such vocalizations and their relationship with overt behavior we tested male Wistar rats in a paradigm of Pavlovian fear conditioning where a tone stimulus (CS) was preceding an aversive foot-shock (US) in a distinct environment.,0
Importantly the shock dose was varied between groups (0-1.1 mA) and its acute and conditioned outcome were determined.,0
The analysis of visible behavior confirms the usefulness of immobility as a measure of fear conditioning especially when higher shock doses were used.,1
Rearing and grooming on the other hand were more useful to detect conditioned effects with lower shock levels.,0
Ultrasonic vocalization occurred less consistently than changes in overt behavior; however dose-response relationships were also observed during the phase of conditioning for example in latency call rate and lengths intervals between calls and sound amplitude.,0
Furthermore total calling time (and rate) were highly correlated with overt behavior namely behavioral inhibition as measured through immobility.,0
These correlations were observed during the phase of fear conditioning and the subsequent tests.,0
Importantly conditioned effects in overt behavior were observed both to the context and to the CS presented in this context whereas conditioned vocalization to the context was not observed (except for one rat).,0
In support and extent of previous results the present data show that a detailed analysis of ultrasonic vocalization can substantially broaden and refine the spectrum of analysis in behavioral work with rats since it can provide information about situational- state- and subject-dependent factors which are partly distinct from what is visible to the experimenter.,0
Social fearfulness is expressed on a continuum of severity from moderate distress to incapacitating fear.,1
The present article focuses on the brain states associated with this broad dimension of social anxiety in humans.,0
In total 70 published studies are summarized documenting the neural correlates of social anxiety during states of rest threat-related cognitive-affective activation and acute symptom provocation.,0
Neural exaggeration in limbic (amygdala) and paralimbic (insula) regions appears to be associated with functional outcomes involving increased attention for and processing of social threat.,1
Evidence is also reviewed showing that social anxiety is characterized by atypical functional connectivity in certain brain networks.,0
Despite a higher prevalence of social anxiety disorder among females males have been overrepresented in the published clinical studies (constituting approximately 56% of the total participants).,0
We evaluate the prospects of nonhuman animal models of social anxiety and discuss several promising directions for future research.,0
The review highlights the need to adopt an integrative network-based approach to the study of the neural substrates underlying social anxiety.,0
Exposure to a deadly threat an adult male rat induced the release of corticosterone in 14-day-old rat pups.,1
The endocrine stress response was decreased when the pups were reunited with their mother immediately after exposure.,1
These findings demonstrate that social variables can reduce the consequences of an aversive experience.,0
Recent findings obtained in patients with phobias or trauma-related anxiety disorders raise doubts concerning the interrelation between acute fear relief during an exposure-based therapeutic session and beneficial treatment progress.,0
In a mouse model explicit for exposure therapy we challenge the view that within-session fear reduction is the turning point for relearning of a stimulus-threat association.,1
Even though within-session extinction of auditory-cued fear memory was identical for prolonged and spaced tone presentations only the latter caused between-session extinction.,0
Furthermore spaced tone presentations led to between-session extinction even in the complete absence of within-session extinction as observed for remote fear memories and in case of abolished cannabinoid receptor type 1 signaling.,1
Induction of between-session extinction was accompanied by an increase in the number of c-Fos-positive neurons within the basolateral amygdala the cingulate cortex and the dentate gyrus independent of the level of within-session extinction.,1
Together our findings demonstrate that within-session extinction is neither sufficient nor essential for between-session extinction thus calling for a reconsideration of current concepts underlying exposure-based therapies.,0
Psychophysiological measures of fear expression provide observable intermediate phenotypes of fear-related symptoms.,0
Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) advocate using neurobiological intermediate phenotypes that provide dimensional correlates of psychopathology.,0
Negative Valence Systems in the RDoC matrix include the construct of acute threat which can be measured on a physiological level using potentiation of the acoustic startle reflex assessed via electromyography recordings of the orbicularis oculi muscle.,1
Impairments in extinction of fear-potentiated startle due to high levels of fear (termed fear load) during the early phases of extinction have been observed in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).,0
The goals of the current work were to examine dimensional associations between fear-related symptoms of PTSD and fear load variables to test their validity as an intermediate phenotype.,1
We examined extinction of fear-potentiated startle in a cohort (n=269) of individuals with a broad range of civilian trauma exposure (range 0-13 traumatic events per person mean=3.5).,0
Based on previously reported findings we hypothesized that fear load would be significantly associated with intrusion and fear memories of an index traumatic event.,1
The results indicated that early extinction was correlated with intrusive thoughts (p=0.0007) and intense physiological reactions to trauma reminders (p=0.036).,0
Degree of adult or childhood trauma exposure and depression severity were not associated with fear load.,0
After controlling for age sex race income level of prior trauma and level of fear conditioning fear load during extinction was still significantly predictive of intrusive thoughts (p=0.004).,0
The significance of these findings is that they support dimensional associations with symptom severity rather than diagnostic category and as such fear load may emerge as a transdiagnostic intermediate phenotype expressed across fear-related disorders (e.g. specific phobia social phobia).,0
Development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is influenced by external factors during early life in mammals which optimizes adult function for predicted conditions.,0
We have hypothesized that adolescence represents a sensitive period for the development of some aspects of adult stress response regulation.,0
This was based on prior work showing that repeated exposure of rats to a stressor across an adolescent period increases fearfulness in a novel environment in adulthood and results in lower levels of dopamine receptor subtype-2 protein in prefrontal cortex.,1
Here we further our investigation of both acute and long-term effects of repeated adolescent stressor exposure on physiological (i.e. corticosterone) and behavioral (i.e. defensive behavior) measures of stress responding in male and female rats.,1
Furthermore we compared outcomes with those following identical manipulations administered in early adulthood and found that animals exposed to cues of predation threat during adolescence showed the most robust defensive responses to a homotypic stressor encountered in adulthood.,1
Peer interaction during control manipulation in adolescence was identified as an important individual characteristic mediating development of adult defensive strategies.,0
AIMS: This study was primarily aimed for developing and testing a valid and reliable instrument that measures perceived threat of the risk for graft rejection after organ transplantation.,0
A second aim was to report descriptive data regarding graft rejection and Health-Related Quality of Life.,0
BACKGROUND: The most serious risk connected with transplantations besides infection is graft rejection.,0
DESIGN: Non experimental descriptive involving instrument development and psychometric assessment.,0
METHOD: Questionnaires about perceived threat of the risk for graft rejection and Health-Related Quality of Life were mailed to 229 OTRs between 19-65 years old.,1
The items were formed from a previous interview study.,0
Patients were transplanted with a kidney a liver or a heart and/or a lung.,0
All patients with follow-up time of one year +/- three months and three years +/- three months were included.,0
RESULTS: With an 81% response rate the study comprised of 185 OTRs who had received either a kidney (n = 117) a liver (n = 39) or heart or lung (n = 29).,0
Three homogenous factors of perceived threat for graft rejection were revealed labelled 'intrusive anxiety' 'graft-related threat' and 'lack of control'.,1
Tests of internal consistency showed good item-scale convergent and discriminatory validity.,0
A majority of the OTRs scored low levels for 'intrusive anxiety'.,0
The kidney transplant recipients experienced more 'graft-related threat' by acute graft rejection than those transplanted with a liver heart or lung.,0
CONCLUSION: In conclusion this study suggests that it is possible to measure the perceived threat of the risk for graft rejection in three homogenous factors.,0
Relevance to clinical practice.,0
The instrument perceived threat of the risk for graft rejection might be usable to measure the impact of fear of graft rejection to predict needs of pedagogical intervention strategies to reduce fear and to improve Health-Related Quality of Life related to graft rejection.,1
Recent evidence suggests that the steroid hormone testosterone can decrease the functional coupling between orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and amygdala.,1
Theoretically this decoupling has been linked to a testosterone-driven increase of goal-directed behaviour in case of threat but this has never been studied directly.,1
Therefore we placed twenty-two women in dynamically changing situations of escapable and inescapable threat after a within-subject placebo controlled testosterone administration.,1
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we provide evidence that testosterone activates the left lateral OFC (LOFC) in preparation of active goal-directed escape and decouples this OFC area from a subcortical threat system including the central-medial amygdala hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray.,0
This LOFC decoupling was specific to threatening situations a point that was further emphasized by an absence of such decoupling in a second experiment focused on resting-state connectivity.,0
These results not only confirm that testosterone administration decouples the LOFC from the subcortical threat system but also show that this is specifically the case in response to acute threat and ultimately leads to an increase in LOFC activity when the participant prepares a goal-directed action to escape.,0
Together these results for the first time provide a detailed understanding of functional brain alterations induced by testosterone under threat conditions and corroborate and extend the view that testosterone prepares the brain for goal-directed action in case of threat.,1
Serotonin reuptake inhibitors may increase symptoms of anxiety immediately following treatment initiation.,0
The present study examined whether acute citalopram increased fear-potentiated startle to predictable and/or unpredictable shocks in healthy subjects.,1
Eighteen healthy subjects each received two treatments placebo and 20 mg citalopram in a crossover design.,0
Participants were exposed to three conditions including one in which predictable aversive shocks were signaled by a cue a second in which unpredictable shocks were anticipated and a third in which no shocks were administered.,1
Changes in aversive states were investigated using acoustic startle stimuli.,1
Citalopram did not affect baseline startle.,0
However the phasic startle potentiation to the threat cue in the predictable condition was robustly increased by acute citalopram.,0
The sustained startle potentiation in the unpredictable conditions was also increased by citalopram but only when the drug was given during the first session.,0
These results indicate that a single dose of citalopram is not anxiogenic in itself but can exacerbate the expression of fear and anxiety.,1
Phan et al.,0
(2008) recently reported that an acute dose of oral THC is associated with a decrease in threat-related amygdala reactivity during a social threat stimulus task.,0
However to date those findings have not been replicated and have not been extended to clinical studies involving smoked rather than oral cannabis.,0
In this study we hypothesized that level of cannabis smoked by participants in our treatment study would be inversely related to the level of threat-related amygdala reactivity.,1
Subjects were recruited from among participants in our double-blind placebo-controlled trial of fluoxetine in comorbid youth with cannabis dependence/major depression.,0
The threat-related amygdala reactivity task used by Hariri et al.,0
(2009) was completed during BOLD fMRI scans at study baseline and then again 12 weeks later at the end of the trial.,1
Data are available from six subjects with pre-and post-treatment fMRI data.,0
During the course of the study five of the six subjects demonstrated a decrease in their level of cannabis use with a mean decrease of 64% and those persons all demonstrated an increase in their level of amygdala reactivity.,0
One subject demonstrated an increase in their level of cannabis use (a 79% increase) during the treatment trial and that person demonstrated a decrease in their level of amygdala reactivity.,0
Thus a higher level of cannabis use was consistently associated with a lower level of amygdala reactivity across all subjects (matched pairs t = 2.70 df = 5 p < 0.05 two-tailed).,1
These findings are consistent with the reports by Phan et al.,0
(2008) and Hariri et al.,0
(2009) suggesting that cannabinoids have an inhibitory effect on threat-related amygdala reactivity.,0
Stress broadly affects the ability to regulate emotions and may contribute to generalization of threat-related behaviors to harmless stimuli.,0
Behavioral generalization also tends to increase over time as memory precision for recent events gives way to more gist-like representations.,0
Thus acute stress coupled with a delay in time from a negative experience may be a strong predictor of the transition from normal to generalized fear expression.,1
Here we investigated the effect of a single-episode acute stressor on generalization of aversive learning when stress is administered either immediately after an aversive learning event or following a delay.,1
In a between-subjects design healthy adult volunteers underwent threat (fear) conditioning using a tone-conditioned stimulus paired with an electric shock to the wrist and another tone not paired with shock.,1
Behavioral generalization was tested to a range of novel tones either on the same day (experiment 1) or 24 h later (experiment 2) and was preceded by either an acute stress induction or a control task.,0
Anticipatory sympathetic arousal [i.e. skin conductance responses (SCRs)] and explicit measures of shock expectancy served as dependent measures.,0
Stress administered shortly after threat conditioning did not affect behavioral generalization.,0
In contrast stress administered following a delay led to heightened arousal and increased generalization of SCRs and explicit measures of shock expectancy.,0
These findings show that acute stress increases generalization of older but not recent threat memories and have clinical relevance to understanding overgeneralization characteristics of anxiety and stress-related disorders.,1
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether exposure to curve versus sharp contours in the built healthcare setting produces systematic and identifiable patterns of amygdala activation and behavioral response in healthy adults.,1
BACKGROUND: Recent studies in cognitive neuroscience suggest that humans prefer objects with a curved contour compared with objects that have pointed features and a sharp-angled contour.,0
An implicit perception of threat represented by sharp objects in humans was hypothesized to explain this bias.,1
METHOD: The study adopted a within-subject experimental design where 36 subjects (representing three age-groups and both sexes) were exposed to a randomized order of 312 real-life images (objects interiors exteriors landscape and a set of control images).,0
Amygdala activation was simultaneously captured using functional magnetic resonance imaging technology.,0
Subjects' preference (like/dislike) data were also collected while in the scanner.,0
Data were collected in 2013.,0
RESULTS: In case of images depicting landscape and healthcare objects brain scans show significant higher amygdala activation associated with sharp contours.,1
However in relation to images depicting hospital interiors and exterior envelops brain scans show significant higher amygdala activation associated with curve contours.,0
These activations pertain to exposure during the precognitive stages of the subjects' perception.,0
CONCLUSION: Hospital forms do have systematic impact on fear response during precognitive stages of human perception.,1
Whether this first impression colors the subsequent experience of an actual patient with real illness or injury is unknown.,0
The NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative aims to describe key dimensional constructs underlying mental function across multiple units of analysis-from genes to observable behaviors-in order to better understand psychopathology.,0
The acute threat (fear) construct of the RDoC Negative Valence System has been studied extensively from a translational perspective and is highly pertinent to numerous psychiatric conditions including anxiety and trauma-related disorders.,0
We examined genetic contributions to the construct of acute threat at two units of analysis within the RDoC framework: (1) neural circuits and (2) physiology.,1
Specifically we focused on genetic influences on activation patterns of frontolimbic neural circuitry and on startle skin conductance and heart rate responses.,1
Research on the heritability of activation in threat-related frontolimbic neural circuitry is lacking but physiological indicators of acute threat have been found to be moderately heritable (35-50%).,0
Genetic studies of the neural circuitry and physiology of acute threat have almost exclusively relied on the candidate gene method and as in the broader psychiatric genetics literature most findings have failed to replicate.,1
The most robust support has been demonstrated for associations between variation in the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genes with threat-related neural activation and physiological responses.,0
However unbiased genome-wide approaches using very large samples are needed for gene discovery and these can be accomplished with collaborative consortium-based research efforts such as those of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) and Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium.,0
Patients with generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD) exhibit heightened activation of the amygdala in response to social cues conveying threat (eg fearful/angry faces).,1
The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) decreases anxiety and stress facilitates social encounters and attenuates amygdala reactivity to threatening faces in healthy subjects.,1
The goal of this study was to examine the effects of OXT on fear-related amygdala reactivity in GSAD and matched healthy control (CON) subjects.,1
In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study utilizing a double-blind placebo-controlled within-subjects design we measured amygdala activation to an emotional face matching task of fearful angry and happy faces following acute intranasal administration of OXT (24 IU or 40.32 mug) and placebo in 18 GSAD and 18 CON subjects.,1
Both the CON and GSAD groups activated bilateral amygdala to all emotional faces during placebo with the GSAD group exhibiting hyperactivity specifically to fearful faces in bilateral amygdala compared with the CON group.,0
OXT had no effect on amygdala activity to emotional faces in the CON group but attenuated the heightened amygdala reactivity to fearful faces in the GSAD group such that the hyperactivity observed during the placebo session was no longer evident following OXT (ie normalization).,0
These findings suggest that OXT has a specific effect on fear-related amygdala activity particularly when the amygdala is hyperactive such as in GSAD thereby providing a brain-based mechanism of the impact of OXT in modulating the exaggerated processing of social signals of threat in patients with pathological anxiety.,0
The ability to adaptively regulate responses to the proximity of potential danger is critical to survival and imbalance in this system may contribute to psychopathology.,0
The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is implicated in defensive responding during uncertain threat anticipation whereas the amygdala may drive responding upon more acute danger.,1
This functional dissociation between the BNST and amygdala is however controversial and human evidence scarce.,0
Here we used data from two independent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies [n = 108 males and n = 70 (45 females)] to probe how coordination between the BNST and amygdala may regulate responses during shock anticipation and actual shock confrontation.,1
In a subset of participants from Sample 2 (n = 48) we demonstrate that anticipation and confrontation evoke bradycardic and tachycardic responses respectively.,0
Further we show that in each sample when going from shock anticipation to the moment of shock confrontation neural activity shifted from a region anatomically consistent with the BNST toward the amygdala.,0
Comparisons of functional connectivity during threat processing showed overlapping yet also consistently divergent functional connectivity profiles for the BNST and amygdala.,0
Finally childhood maltreatment levels predicted amygdala but not BNST hyperactivity during shock anticipation.,0
Our results support an evolutionary conserved defensive distance-dependent dynamic balance between BNST and amygdala activity.,0
Shifts in this balance may enable shifts in defensive reactions via the demonstrated differential functional connectivity.,0
Our results indicate that early life stress may tip the neural balance toward acute threat responding and via that route predispose for affective disorder.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Previously proposed differential contributions of the BNST and amygdala to fear and anxiety have been recently debated.,0
Despite the significance of understanding their contributions to defensive reactions there is a paucity of human studies that directly compared these regions on activity and connectivity during threat processing.,1
We show strong evidence for a dissociable role of the BNST and amygdala in threat processing by demonstrating in two large participant samples that they show a distinct temporal signature of threat responding as well as a discriminable pattern of functional connections and differential sensitivity to early life threat.,0
Fear generalization occurs when a response previously acquired with a threatening stimulus is transferred to a similar one.,1
However it could be maladaptive when stimuli that do not represent a real threat are appraised as dangerous which is a hallmark of several anxiety disorders.,0
Stress exposure is a major risk factor for the occurrence of anxiety disorders and it is well established that it influences different phases of fear memory; nevertheless its impact on the generalization of contextual fear memories has been less studied.,0
In the present work we have characterized the impact of acute restraint stress prior to contextual fear conditioning on the generalization of this fear memory and the role of the GABAergic signaling within the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) on the stress modulatory effects.,1
We have found that a single stress exposure promoted the generalization of this memory trace to a different context that was well discriminated in unstressed conditioned animals.,0
Moreover this effect was dependent on the formation of a contextual associative memory and on the testing order (i.e. conditioning context first vs generalization context first).,0
Furthermore we observed that increasing GABA-A signaling by intra-BLA midazolam administration prior to the stressful session exposure prevented the generalization of fear memory whereas intra-BLA administration of the GABA-A antagonist (Bicuculline) prior to fear conditioning induced the generalization of fear memory in unstressed rats.,1
We concluded that stress exposure prior to contextual fear conditioning promotes the generalization of fear memory and that the GABAergic transmission within the BLA has a critical role in this phenomenon.,1
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that greater global and situational relationship satisfaction would reduce the negative impact of threatening information on acute pain.,0
DESIGN: An experimental design was used to manipulate threat and elicit acute pain via a cold pressor task.,1
SETTING: The study was completed in a research laboratory at a large urban university in the Midwestern USA.,0
SUBJECTS: Participants were 134 couples in which at least one individual was an undergraduate student.,0
METHODS: After administration of a global relationship satisfaction measure couples were randomly assigned to either receive high or low threatening information about the painful task.,0
Following the threat manipulation couples discussed the upcoming task and rated their satisfaction with the interaction (i.e. situational relationship satisfaction).,0
The designated pain participant then completed the painful task alone.,0
RESULTS: The threat manipulation altered couples' perceived threat of pain.,0
Situational relationship satisfaction moderated the effect of threat on pain trajectories such that situational relationship satisfaction predicted less pain intensity at an earlier point in the task for the low threat condition than the high threat condition.,0
Greater global relationship satisfaction predicted greater likelihood of task completion among those in the low threat condition whereas it was unrelated to task completion in the high threat condition.,0
Greater global relationship satisfaction also predicted lower pain intensity throughout the task.,0
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that the interpersonal context is independently related to acute pain and may also alter the effect of threatening information on acute pain.,1
Chronically elevated HPA activity has often been associated with fear and anxiety but there is evidence that single administrations of glucocorticoids may acutely reduce fear.,1
Moreover peri-traumatic cortisol elevation may protect against development of post-traumatic stress disorder.,0
Hypervigilant processing of threat information plays a role in anxiety disorders and although relations with HPA functioning have been established causality of these relations remains unclear.,1
Presently self-reported anxiety and response time patterns on a masked emotional Stroop task with fearful faces were measured in 20 healthy young men after double-blind placebo-controlled oral administration of 40 mg cortisol.,1
The masked fearful Stroop task measures vocal colornaming response latencies for pictures of neutral and fearful faces presented below the threshold for conscious perception.,0
Results showed increased response times on trials for fearful compared to neutral faces after placebo but this emotional Stroop effect was acutely abolished by cortisol administration.,0
This effect was most pronounced in subjects with heightened anxiety levels.,0
This is the first evidence showing that exogenous cortisol acutely reduces anxiety-driven selective attention to threat.,0
These results extend earlier findings of acute fear reduction after glucocorticoid administration.,1
This suggests interactions of HPA functioning and vigilant attention in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders.,0
Possible neuroendocrine mechanisms of action are discussed.,0
The use of fear conditioning and extinction paradigms to examine intermediate phenotypes of anxiety and stress-related disorders has facilitated the identification of neurobiological mechanisms that underlie specific components of abnormal psychological functioning.,0
Across species acute pharmacologic manipulation of the endogenous cannabinoid system has provided evidence of its critical role in fear extinction but the effects of chronic cannabis on extinction are relatively understudied.,0
In rats chronic cannabinoid administration impairs fear extinction in a drug-free state.,1
Here we examine whether chronic cannabis use is associated with impaired fear extinction in humans.,1
Participants were healthy chronic cannabis users (n = 20) and nonuser controls with minimal lifetime cannabis use (n = 20) matched on age sex and race who all screened negative for psychiatric disorders.,0
A 2-day differential fear conditioning paradigm was used to test the hypothesis that chronic cannabis use would be associated with impaired extinction of the skin conductance response.,1
Consistent with hypotheses chronic cannabis use was associated with reduced within-session extinction of skin conductance response on Day 1 (d = 0.78) and between-session extinction on Day 2 (d = 0.76).,0
Unexpectedly cannabis use was also associated with reduced subjective differentiation between threat and safety stimuli during conditioning.,0
Replication and translation of findings are necessary to test potential mechanisms directly and examine whether impairments can be reversed pharmacologically or after a period of cannabis abstinence.,0

RATIONALE: In this study we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the effects of acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) a well-recognised method for inducing transient cerebral serotonin depletion on brain activation to fearful faces.,1
OBJECTIVES: We predicted that ATD would increase the responsiveness of the amygdala to fearful faces as a function of individual variation in threat sensitivity.,1
METHODS: Twelve healthy male volunteers received a tryptophan depleting drink or a tryptophan balancing amino acid drink (placebo) in a double-blind crossover design.,0
Five hours after drink ingestion participants were scanned whilst viewing fearful happy and neutral faces.,0
RESULTS: Consistent with previous findings fearful faces induced significant signal change in the bilateral amygdala/hippocampus as well as the fusiform face area and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.,1
Furthermore ATD modulated amygdala/hippocampus activation in response to fearful relative to happy faces as a function of self-reported threat sensitivity (as measured with the Behavioral Inhibition Scale; Carver CS White TL (1994) Behavioral inhibition behavioral activation and affective responses to impending reward and punishment: the BIS/BAS scales.,0
J Pers Soc Psychol 67:319-333).,0
CONCLUSION: The data support the hypothesis that individual variation in threat sensitivity interacts with manipulation of 5-HT function to bias the processing of amygdala-dependent threat-relevant stimuli.,1
Fear promotes adaptive responses to threats.,1
However when the level of fear is not proportional to the level of threat maladaptive fear-related behaviors characteristic of anxiety disorders result.,1
Post-traumatic stress disorder develops in response to a traumatic event and patients often show sensitized reactions to mild stressors associated with the trauma.,0
Stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL) is a rodent model of this sensitized responding in which exposure to a 15-shock stressor nonassociatively enhances subsequent fear conditioning training with only a single trial.,1
We examined the role of corticosterone (CORT) in SEFL.,1
Administration of the CORT synthesis blocker metyrapone prior to the stressor but not at time points after attenuated SEFL.,0
Moreover CORT co-administered with metyrapone rescued SEFL.,0
However CORT alone without the stressor was not sufficient to produce SEFL.,0
In these same animals we then looked for correlates of SEFL in terms of changes in excitatory receptor expression.,0
Western blot analysis of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) revealed an increase in the GluA1 AMPA receptor subunit that correlated with SEFL.,1
Thus CORT is permissive to trauma-induced changes in BLA function.,0
Acute pain informs the individual that there is an imminent threat of body damage and is associated with the urge to escape and avoid.,0
Fear learning takes place when neutral stimuli receive the propensity to predict the occurrence of pain and when defensive responses are initiated in anticipation of potential threats to the integrity of the body.,1
Fear-avoidance models have been put forward featuring the role of individual differences in catastrophic interpretations of pain in the modulation of learning and avoidance.,0
Based on extensive literature on fear reduction in anxiety disorders; cognitive-behavioral treatments have been developed and applied to patients with chronic pain reporting substantial pain-related fear.,1
In this article we discuss mechanisms underlying the acquisition the assessment and extinction of pain-related fear through the cognitive-behavioral treatment of pain-related fear.,1
Finally we provide a number of critical notes and directions for future research in the field of chronic pain and pain-related fear.,0
