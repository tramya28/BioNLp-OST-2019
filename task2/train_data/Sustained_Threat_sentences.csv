Several lines of evidence suggest that the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) are differentially involved in phasic and sustained fear.,0
Even though results from neuroimaging studies support this distinction a specific effect of a temporal dissociation with phasic responses to onset versus sustained responses during prolonged states of threat anticipation has not been shown yet.,1
To explore this issue we investigated brain activation during anticipation of threat in 38 healthy participants by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging.,1
Participants were presented different visual cues indicated the temporally unpredictable occurrence of a subsequent aversive or neutral stimulus.,0
During the onset of aversive versus neutral anticipatory cues results showed a differential phasic activation of amygdala anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC).,0
In contrast activation in the BNST and other brain regions including insula dorsolateral PFC ACC cuneus posterior cingulate cortex and periaqueductal grey was characterized by a sustained response during the threat versus neutral anticipation period.,0
Analyses of functional connectivity showed phasic amygdala response as positively associated with activation mainly in sensory cortex areas whereas sustained BNST activation was negatively associated with activation in visual cortex and positively correlated with activation in the insula and thalamus.,0
These findings suggest that the amygdala is responsive to the onset of cues signaling the unpredictable occurrence of a potential threat while the BNST in concert with other areas is involved in sustained anxiety.,1
Furthermore the amygdala and BNST are characterized by distinctive connectivity patterns during threat anticipation.,0
The error-related negativity (ERN) currently appears as a physiological measure in relation to three Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) constructs: Cognitive Control Sustained Threat and Reward Learning.,0
We propose a conceptual model in which variance in the ERN reflects individual differences in the degree to which errors are evaluated as threatening.,0
We also discuss evidence for the placement of the ERN in the Sustained Threat construct as well as evidence that the ERN may more specifically reflect sensitivity to endogenous threat.,1
Following this we present data from a sample of 515 adolescent females demonstrating a larger ERN in relation to self-reported checking behaviors but only in older adolescents suggesting that sensitivity to internal threat and the ERN-checking relationship may follow a developmental course as adolescents develop behavioral control.,1
In contrast depressive symptoms were linked to a smaller ERN and this association was invariant with respect to age.,0
Collectively these data suggest that the magnitude of the ERN is sensitive both to specific anxiety-related processes and depression in opposing directions that may reflect variation in internal threat sensitivity.,1
We discuss directions for future research as well as ways in which findings for the ERN complement and challenge aspects of the current RDoC matrix.,0
Blood-injection-injury (BII) phobia differs from other subtypes of specific phobia in that it is associated with elevated disgust-sensitivity as well as specific autonomic and brain responses during processing of phobia-relevant stimuli.,0
To what extent these features play a role already during threat anticipation is unclear.,0
In the current fMRI experiment 16 female BII phobics and 16 female healthy controls anticipated the presentation of phobia-specific and neutral pictures.,1
On the behavioral level anxiety dominated the anticipatory period in BII phobics relative to controls while both anxiety and disgust were elevated during picture presentation.,0
By applying two different models for the analysis of brain responses to anticipation of phobia-specific versus neutral stimuli we found initial and sustained increases of activation in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) insula lateral and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) thalamus and visual areas as well as initial activation in the amygdala for BII phobics as compared to healthy controls.,0
These results suggest that BII phobia is characterized by activation of a typical neural defense network during threat anticipation with anxiety as the predominant emotion.,1
Different degrees of threat predictability are thought to induce either phasic fear or sustained anxiety.,0
Maladaptive sustained anxious apprehension is thought to result in overgeneralization of anxiety and thereby to contribute to the development of anxiety disorders.,1
Therefore differences in threat predictability have been associated with pathological states of anxiety with specific phobia (SP) representing phasic fear as heightened response to predictable threat while panic disorder (PD) is characterized by sustained anxiety (unpredictable threat) and as a consequence overgeneralization of fear.,1
The present study aimed to delineate commonalities and differences in the neural substrates of the impact of threat predictability on affective processing in these two anxiety disorders.,0
Twenty PD patients 20 SP patients and 20 non-anxious control subjects were investigated with an adapted NPU-design (no predictable unpredictable threat) using whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG).,0
Group independent neural activity in the right dlPFC increased with decreasing threat predictability.,0
PD patients showed a sustained hyperactivation of the vmPFC under threat and safety conditions.,0
The magnitude of hyperactivation was inversely correlated with PDs subjective arousal and anxiety sensitivity.,0
Both PD and SP patients revealed decreased parietal processing of affective stimuli.,0
Findings indicate overgeneralization between threat and safety conditions and increased need for emotion regulation via the vmPFC in PD but not SP patients.,0
Both anxiety disorders showed decreased activation in parietal networks possibly indicating attentional avoidance of affective stimuli.,0
Present results complement findings from fear conditioning studies and underline overgeneralization of fear particularly in PD.,0
The creation of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project has been the driving force behind the reconceptualization of the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders.,0
In this commentary I explore whether the error-related negativity can be considered as a transdiagnostic marker of sustained threat based on findings from Weinberg Meyer et al.,1
's (2016) study in relation to current findings in the literature.,0
Potential alternative study designs use of a multimodal approach to the assessment of a specific phenotype of clinical phenomenon and the importance of integrating a neurodevelopmental perspective are also discussed.,0
Biased attention to emotional stimuli plays a key role in the RDoC constructs of Sustained Threat and Loss.,1
In this article we review approaches to assessing these biases their links with psychopathology and the underlying neural influences.,1
We then review evidence from twin and candidate gene studies regarding genetic influences on attentional biases.,0
We also discuss the impact of developmental and environmental influences and end with a number of suggestions for future research in this area.,0
The anxiety inducing paradigms such as the threat-of-shock paradigm have provided ample data on the emotional processing of predictable and unpredictable threat but little is known about the processing of aversive threat-irrelevant stimuli in these paradigms.,0
We investigated how the predictability of threat influences the neural visual processing of threat-irrelevant fearful and neutral faces.,1
Thirty-two healthy individuals participated in an NPU-threat test consisting of a safe or neutral condition (N) and a predictable (P) as well as an unpredictable (U) threat condition using audio-visual threat stimuli.,1
In all NPU-conditions we registered participants' brain responses to threat-irrelevant faces via magnetoencephalography.,0
The data showed that increasing unpredictability of threat evoked increasing emotion regulation during face processing predominantly in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex regions during an early to mid-latency time interval.,0
Importantly we obtained only main effects but no significant interaction of facial expression and conditions of different threat predictability neither in behavioral nor in neural data.,1
Healthy individuals with average trait anxiety are thus able to maintain adaptive stimulus evaluation processes under predictable and unpredictable threat conditions.,0
BACKGROUND: Cognitive models of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) implicate threat-related attentional biases in the etiology and phenomenology of the disorder.,0
However extant attentional research using reaction time (RT)-based paradigms and measures has yielded mixed results.,0
Eye-tracking methodology has emerged in recent years to overcome several inherent drawbacks of RT-based tasks striving to better delineate attentional processes.,0
METHODS: A systematic review of experimental studies examining threat-related attention biases in PTSD using eye-tracking methodology and group-comparison designs was conducted conforming to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.,1
Studies were selected following a systematic search for publications between 1980 and December 2017 in PsycINFO MEDLINE and the National Center for PTSD Research's Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress (PILOTS) database.,0
Additional records were identified by employing the Similar Articles feature in PubMed and the Cited Reference Search in ISI Web of Science.,0
Reference sections of review articles book chapters and studies selected for inclusion were searched for further studies.,0
Ongoing studies were also sought through Clinicaltrials.gov.,0
RESULTS: A total of 11 studies (n = 456 participants in total) were included in the final review.,0
Results indicated little support for enhanced threat detection hypervigilance and attentional avoidance.,0
However consistent evidence emerged for sustained attention on threat (i.e.,1
attention maintenance) in PTSD.,0
CONCLUSIONS: This review is the first to systematically evaluate extant findings in PTSD emanating from eye-tracking studies employing group-comparison designs.,0
Results suggest that sustained attention on threat might serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.,0
Contextual fear conditioning takes place if the occurrence of threat cannot be predicted by specific cues.,0
As a consequence the context becomes the best predictor of the threat and later induces anxiety (sustained fear response).,1
Previous studies suggest that both the amygdala and the hippocampus are crucial for contextual fear conditioning.,0
First we wanted to further elucidate the neuronal correlates of long-lasting contextual threat within a highly ecologically setting created in virtual reality (VR).,1
Second we wanted to distinguish between initial and sustained components of the anxiety response to a threatening situation.,0
Twenty-four participants were guided through two virtual offices for 30s each.,0
They received unpredictable electric stimuli (unconditioned stimulus US) in one office (anxiety context CXT+) but never in the second office (safety context CXT-).,0
Successful contextual fear conditioning was indexed by higher anxiety and enhanced US-expectancy ratings for CXT+ versus CXT-.,0
Initial neural activity was assessed by modeling the onsets of both contexts and sustained neural activity by considering the entire context duration (contrasts: CXT+ > CXT-).,0
Amygdala and hippocampus revealed sustained activity.,0
Initial and sustained activities were found in the middle temporal gyrus and primary motor cortex (M1).,0
Additional initial activity was obvious in orbitofrontal (OFC) dorsomedial (dmPFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC).,0
These results suggest that entering a threatening context initially induces conditioned fear reactions (M1) recall of contingency awareness (dlPFC) and explicit threat appraisal (dmPFC OFC).,0
While remaining in the threatening context might involve anxiety-like conditioned responses (amygdala M1) and the generation of a spatial map to predict where and when a threatening event may occur (hippocampus).,0
We conclude that in humans initial versus sustained anxiety responses triggered by a threat associated context are associated with distinguishable brain activation patterns involving a fear network and a contingency-cognitive network respectively.,0
BACKGROUND: Abnormal patterns of attention to threat and reward have been proposed as potential mechanisms of dysfunction in anxiety and mood disorders.,0
However research on this topic has been inconsistent perhaps because of both clinical heterogeneity in the samples assessed and measurement of attentional biases that is temporally imprecise.,0
METHODS: The present study measured transdiagnostic symptoms of anxiety and depression in 205 young adults and recorded affect-modulated event-related potentials in response to task-irrelevant pictures in a speeded response task.,1
RESULTS: Low positive affect was uniquely associated with reduced modulation of later event-related potentials (i.e. the P300 and the late positive potential) by rewarding images suggesting deficits in sustained attention to reward.,0
Low positive affect was also associated with a blunted threat-elicited late positive potential.,0
Symptoms of panic were associated with an increased N1 to rewarding images as well as an increased late positive potential to all picture types.,0
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that dysfunction in neural markers of sustained attention to threat and reward relate in specific ways to transdiagnostic symptom dimensions of anxiety and depression.,1
Moreover event-related potentials are likely to be useful in investigations of the time course of attentional abnormalities associated with these symptom dimensions.,0
The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and central amygdala (CeA) of the extended amygdala are small anatomically interconnected brain regions.,0
They are thought to mediate responses to sustained unpredictable threat stimuli and phasic predictable threat stimuli respectively.,0
They perform these operations largely through their interconnected networks.,0
In two previous studies we mapped and contrasted the resting functional connectivity networks of the BNST and CeA at 7 Tesla with high resolution.,0
This follow-up study investigates the changes in functional connectivity of these structures during sustained anticipation of electric shock.,1
Results show that the BNST and CeA become less strongly coupled with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) cingulate and nucleus accumbens in shock threat relative to a safety condition.,0
In addition the CeA becomes more strongly coupled with the thalamus under threat.,0
An exploratory whole-brain connectivity analysis reveals that although the BNST/CeA exhibits generally decreased connectivity many other cortical regions demonstrate greater coupling under threat than safety.,0
Understanding the differential network structures of these two regions and how they contribute to processing under threat will help elucidate the building blocks of the anxious state.,1
BACKGROUND: Though a key symptom underlying many anxiety disorders is hypervigilant threat monitoring its biological bases in humans remain poorly understood.,0
Animal models suggest that anxious processes such as hypervigilant threat monitoring are distinct from cued fear-like responses and mediated by the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST).,0
Here we applied psychophysiological and neuroimaging methodologies sensitive to sustained arousal-based responses to test the role of the human BNST in mediating environmental threat monitoring a potential experimental model for sustained anxiety symptoms.,1
METHODS: Healthy participants (n = 50) with varying trait anxiety performed an environmental threat-monitoring task during functional magnetic resonance imaging where a stimulus line continuously fluctuated in height providing information relevant to subsequent risk for electric shocks.,0
Skin conductance was collected in a separate cohort (n = 47) to validate task-evoked modulation of physiological arousal.,0
RESULTS: A forebrain region consistent with the BNST showed greater overall recruitment and exaggerated tracking of threat proximity in individuals with greater anxiety.,1
The insular cortex tracked threat proximity across all participants showed exaggerated threat proximity responding with greater anxiety and showed enhanced recruitment when threat proximity was ostensibly controllable.,0
CONCLUSIONS: Activity in the BNST and insula continuously monitored changes in environmental threat level and also subserved hypervigilant threat-monitoring processes in more highly trait anxious individuals.,0
These findings bridge human and animal research informing the role of the BNST in anxious-related processes.,0
In addition these findings suggest that continuous functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigms offer promise in further elucidating the neural circuitries supporting sustained anticipatory features of anxiety.,0
Researchers have only recently begun using functional neuroimaging to explore the human response to periods of sustained anxious anticipation namely potential threat.,1
Here we investigated brain responses acquired with functional MRI during an instructed threat of shock paradigm used to create sustained periods of aversive anticipation.,0
In this re-analysis of previously published data we employed quadratic discriminant analysis to classify the multivariate pattern of whole-brain functional connectivity and to identify connectivity changes during periods of potential threat.,1
Our method identifies clusters with altered connectivity on a voxelwise basis thus eschewing the need to define regions a priori.,0
Classifier generalization was evaluated by testing on data from participants not used during training.,0
Robust classification between threat and safe contexts was possible and inspection of diagnostic features revealed altered functional connectivity involving the intraparietal sulcus task-negative regions striatum and anterior cingulate cortex.,0
We anticipate that the proposed method will prove useful to experimenters wishing to identify large-scale functional networks that distinguish between experimental conditions or groups.,0
The present study examined the effects of sustained anticipatory anxiety on the affective modulation of the eyeblink startle reflex.,1
Towards this end pleasant neutral and unpleasant pictures were presented as a continuous stream during alternating threat-of-shock and safety periods which were cued by colored picture frames.,0
Orbicularis-EMG to auditory startle probes and electrodermal activity were recorded.,0
Previous findings regarding affective picture valence and threat-of-shock modulation were replicated.,0
Of main interest anticipating aversive events and viewing affective pictures additively modulated defensive activation.,0
Specifically despite overall potentiated startle blink magnitude in threat-of-shock conditions the startle reflex remained sensitive to hedonic picture valence.,0
Finally skin conductance level revealed sustained sympathetic activation throughout the entire experiment during threat- compared to safety-periods.,0
Overall defensive activation by physical threat appears to operate independently from reflex modulation by picture media.,0
The present data confirms the importance of simultaneously manipulating phasic-fear and sustained-anxiety in studying both normal and abnormal anxiety.,1
BACKGROUND: Processes of phasic fear responses to threatening stimuli are thought to be distinct from sustained anticipatory anxiety toward an unpredicted potential threat.,1
There is evidence for dissociable neural correlates of phasic fear and sustained anxiety.,0
Whereas increased amygdala activity has been associated with phasic fear sustained anxiety has been linked with activation of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the insula.,1
So far only a few studies have focused on the dissociation of neural processes related to both phasic and sustained fear in specific phobia.,0
We suggested that first conditions of phasic and sustained fear would involve different neural networks and second that overall neural activity would be enhanced in a sample of phobic compared to nonphobic participants.,0
METHODS: Pictures of spiders and neutral stimuli under conditions of either predicted (phasic) or unpredicted (sustained) fear were presented to 28 subjects with spider phobia and 28 nonphobic control subjects during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning.,0
RESULTS: Phobic patients revealed significantly higher amygdala activation than controls under conditions of phasic fear.,0
Sustained fear processing was significantly related to activation in the insula and ACC and phobic patients showed a stronger activation than controls of the BNST and the right ACC under conditions of sustained fear.,1
Functional connectivity analysis revealed enhanced connectivity of the BNST and the amygdala in phobic subjects.,0
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the idea of distinct neural correlates of phasic and sustained fear processes.,0
Increased neural activity and functional connectivity in these networks might be crucial for the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders.,0
Anxiety disorders increase risk for the early development of several diseases of aging.,0
Elevated inflammation a common risk factor across diseases of aging may play a key role in the relationship between anxiety and physical disease.,1
However the neurobiological mechanisms linking anxiety with elevated inflammation remain unclear.,0
In this review we present a neurobiological model of the mechanisms by which anxiety promotes inflammation.,0
Specifically we propose that exaggerated neurobiological sensitivity to threat in anxious individuals may lead to sustained threat perception which is accompanied by prolonged activation of threat-related neural circuitry and threat-responsive biological systems including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis autonomic nervous system (ANS) and inflammatory response.,1
Over time this pattern of responding can promote chronic inflammation through structural and functional brain changes altered sensitivity of immune cell receptors dysregulation of the HPA axis and ANS and accelerated cellular aging.,1
Chronic inflammation in turn increases risk for diseases of aging.,0
Exaggerated neurobiological sensitivity to threat may thus be a treatment target for reducing disease risk in anxious individuals.,0
Feelings of uncontrollability and anxiety regarding possibly harmful events are key features of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology.,1
Due to a lack of studies the neural correlates of anticipatory anxiety in PTSD are still poorly understood.,0
During functional magnetic resonance imaging female PTSD patients with interpersonal violence trauma and healthy controls (HC) anticipated the temporally unpredictable presentation of aversive (human scream) or neutral sounds.,0
Based on separate analysis models we investigated phasic and sustained brain activations.,1
PTSD patients reported increased anxiety during anticipation of aversive versus neutral sounds.,0
Furthermore we found both increased initial phasic amygdala activation and increased sustained activation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) during anticipation of aversive versus neutral sounds in PTSD patients in comparison to HC.,0
PTSD patients as compared with HC also showed increased phasic responses in mid-cingulate cortex (MCC) posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) mid-insula and lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) as well as increased sustained responses in MCC PCC anterior insula and lateral and medial PFC.,0
Our results demonstrate a relationship between anticipatory anxiety in PTSD patients and hyperresponsiveness of brain regions that have previously been associated with PTSD symptomatology.,0
Additionally the dissociation between amygdala and BNST indicates distinct temporal and functional characteristics and suggests that phasic fear and sustained anxiety responses are enhanced during unpredictable anticipation of aversive stimuli in PTSD.,1

BACKGROUND: The amygdala has been strongly implicated in the processing of threat-relevant information in specific phobia.,0
However there is an ongoing debate as to whether the amygdala may also be engaged outside of conscious stimulus awareness.,0
Furthermore considering that sustained vigilance for threat constitutes a crucial characteristic of specific phobias we hypothesized a possible role of this symptom in modulating amygdala sensitivity to disorder-relevant cues.,1
Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging we examined responses of the amygdala to subliminal and supraliminal phobogenic stimuli in spider-phobic subjects and whether these responses might be specifically associated with disorder-related hypervigilance.,0
METHODS: Eighteen female spider-phobic subjects and 18 healthy female control subjects were exposed to pictures of spiders and phobia-irrelevant objects presented briefly during two backward-masking conditions used to manipulate stimulus awareness.,0
Brain activation data were analyzed as a function of subjects' perceptual performance on each single trial and were tested for correlations with different components of the phobic symptomatology such as vigilance as assessed by self-report scales.,0
RESULTS: Compared with control subjects phobic participants showed stronger responses of both amygdalae to consciously perceived spiders versus nonspider targets whereas during unconscious stimulus processing enhanced activation was only apparent in the right amygdala.,0
Moreover the intensity of disorder-related vigilance was positively correlated with right amygdala activation specifically during the subliminal condition.,0
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence for unconscious threat processing in specific phobia with the magnitude of amygdala responses specifically potentiated by sustained hypervigilance for threat.,1
Aberrations in this vigilance system may be critically involved in anxiety disorders.,0
