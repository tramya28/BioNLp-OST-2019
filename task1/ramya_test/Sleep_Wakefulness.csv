"PURPOSE: Our aim was to study the relation between epilepsy and sleep-wakefulness cycles in the amygdala-kindling model of temporal lobe epilepsy. METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were electrically kindled through bipolar electrodes implanted in the anterior amygdala. Polysomnographic recordings were taken before and after kindled seizures for 6 h. For the studies on the effects of a single, full-blown seizure, recordings were taken immediately after the seizure and daily thereafter until the recordings returned to baseline values. For studies on the effects of five full-blown seizures, recordings were taken immediately after the fifth seizure and then on day 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, and 28. RESULTS: Polysomnographic recordings taken immediately after the first full-blown seizure revealed an initial increase in the duration of deep slow-wave sleep (SII), a decrease in the light slow-wave sleep (SI) stage of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and a decrease in the quiet wakefulness (W2) stage of wakefulness. All these parameters returned to baseline values after 24 h. The duration of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep increased and returned to the baseline value after 48 h. Five consecutive full-blown seizures caused an increase in the duration of SII from the day the seizures occured until day 28, whereas the duration of SI decreased for 72 h. The duration of REM sleep, decreased only on the day of the seizures and day 1, while decreases in the number of REM episodes were observed on the day of the seizure, day 2 and day 14. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that even a single, full-blown seizure can cause alterations in the architecture of sleep-wakefulness cycles for a short duration, and that multiple seizures produce long-term effects."
"AIM AND METHODS: The effects of an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase L-NAME and a precursor of NO(L-arginine) on sleep-wakefulness in rats were examined. RESULTS: 1. The time of waking was increased(P < 0.01) and the time of SWS was decreased(P < 0.01) during the first two hours after injection intracerebroventricularly(i.c.v.) of L-NAME 1 mg, this effect was showed across the 4 h recording period(P < 0.05). The i.c.v. injection of L-NAME 0.2 mg had no significant effect. 2. The time of waking was su-ppressed during the third and fourth hours after i.c.v. injection of L-arginine 300 micrograms(P < 0.05). At the same time the increase of SWS was observed (P < 0.01). 3. There was no change on W, SWS, PS when L-NAME 1 mg was given after administration of L-arginine. CONCLUSION: The excitatory effect of L-NAME on wakefulness is mediated by inhibition of NOS. This effect could be antagonized by L-arginine. It suggests that NO is involved in regulation of sleep-wakefulness."
"RATIONALE: New sleep disturbance model in rats is useful for estimating the characteristics of some hypnotics. OBJECTIVES: The present study was undertaken to investigate the utility of a sleep disturbance model by placing rats on a grid suspended over water using three kinds of hypnotics, that is, short-acting benzodiazepine (triazolam), intermediate-acting benzodiazepine (flunitrazepam) and long-acting barbiturate (phenobarbital). METHODS: Electrodes for measurement of EEG and EMG were implanted into the frontal cortex and the dorsal neck muscle of rats. EEG and EMG were recorded with an electroencephalogram. SleepSign ver.2.0 was used for EEG and EMG analysis. Total times of wakefulness, non-REM and REM sleep were measured from 0900 to 1500 hours. RESULTS: In rats placed on the grid suspended over water up to 1 cm under the grid surface, not only triazolam but also flunitrazepam and phenobarbital caused a shortening of sleep latency. Both flunitrazepam and phenobarbital were effective in increasing of total non-REM sleep time in rats placed on sawdust or the grid, and the effects of both drugs in rats placed on the grid were larger than those in rats placed on sawdust. Measurement of the hourly non-REM sleep time was useful for investigating the peak time and duration of effect of the three hypnotics. Phenobarbital showed a decrease in total REM sleep time in rats placed on the grid, although both triazolam and flunitrazepam were without effect. CONCLUSIONS: The present insomnia model can be used as a sleep disturbance model for testing not only the sleep-inducing effects but also the sleep-maintaining effects including non-REM sleep and REM sleep of hypnotics."
"Sports and military environments have many common features - intense physical activity, rigorous physical environment (heat, cold, high or low pressure, hypoxia, acceleration...), specific psychosocial atmosphere, team spirit. If combined with jet lag syndrome, these specific conditions can favor altered physical and mental performance. There is always the temptation to use drugs as a simple way to reduce the penalizing effects. The available compounds known to affect sleep and wakefulness include hypnotics, benzodiazepines and non benzodiazepines such as temazepam, zolopidem, and zopiclone, stimulants such as amphetamine and amphetamine-like agents, adrafinil, modafinil, caffeine and chronobiotics substances such as melatonin and, more recently, slow release caffeine. In the sports area, all of these substances except caffeine are on the list of forbidden products, although special authorizations linked to known disease conditions are allowed. In the military setting, the environment may be similar, but the context of use is very different. In the context of a rescue mission, the current practice in the French military organization is to place modafinil pills in the ejection seat of fight planes and in rescue boats. A second context is the use of anti-sleep agents under orders; the debate continues on this and the appropriate recommendations in this context. Self-medication is a third condition, in which case no rules have been defined."
"OBJECTIVE: This paper proposes a method for classifying sleep-wakefulness and estimating sleep parameters using nasal pressure signals applicable to a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device. APPROACH: In order to classify the sleep-wakefulness states of patients with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), apnea-hypopnea and snoring events are first detected. Epochs detected as SDB are classified as sleep, and time-domain- and frequency-domain-based features are extracted from the epochs that are detected as normal breathing. Subsequently, sleep-wakefulness is classified using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier in the normal breathing epoch. Finally, four sleep parameters-sleep onset, wake after sleep onset, total sleep time and sleep efficiency-are estimated based on the classified sleep-wakefulness. In order to develop and test the algorithm, 110 patients diagnosed with SDB participated in this study. Ninety of the subjects underwent full-night polysomnography (PSG) and twenty underwent split-night PSG. The subjects were divided into 50 patients of a training set (full/split: 42/8), 30 of a validation set (full/split: 24/6) and 30 of a test set (full/split: 24/6). MAIN RESULTS: In the experiments conducted, sleep-wakefulness classification accuracy was found to be 83.2% in the test set, compared with the PSG scoring results of clinical experts. Furthermore, all four sleep parameters showed higher correlations than the results obtained via PSG (r 0.84, p < 0.05). In order to determine whether the proposed method is applicable to CPAP, sleep-wakefulness classification performances were evaluated for each CPAP in the split-night PSG data. The results indicate that the accuracy and sensitivity of sleep-wakefulness classification by CPAP variation shows no statistically significant difference (p < 0.05). SIGNIFICANCE: The contributions made in this study are applicable to the automatic classification of sleep-wakefulness states in CPAP devices and evaluation of the quality of sleep."
"PURPOSE: Our aim was to study the effect of prolonged administration of vigabatrin (VGB) on sleep-wakefulness cycle in kindled seizure-induced rats. METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were implanted stereotaxically with electrodes for kindling and polysomnography. The rats were divided into two groups, kindled and VGB-treated kindled rats. VGB was administered intraperitonially every day for 21 days, and polysomnographic recordings were taken after doses 1, 7, 14, and 21. The drug effects were evaluated by comparing the records of kindled and drug-treated kindled rats. RESULTS: The VGB-administered kindled rats showed an increase in total sleep time (TST) due to an increase in total non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and light slow-wave sleep stage I (SI) with a decrease in wakefulness. The number of episodes and REM onset latencies were found to be decreased after drug treatment. CONCLUSIONS: It can therefore be concluded that VGB has a somnolence-inducing effect and that it might mediate its anticonvulsant effect by altering sleep architecture through sleep-regulating areas."
"Shift work is related to problems in sleep/wakefulness and social life. The effects of a very rapidly forward rotating shift system on sleep, health and well-being of young (-45) and elderly (45+) maintenance workers were studied by a controlled intervention study. In the beginning, all the workers had a continuous backward rotating three-shift system. A very quickly forward rotating shift system was developed, avoiding consecutive night shifts and with more free-time between the individual shifts. The effect of the new shift system on sleep/wakefulness and general well-being was studied by questionnaire and field studies including on-site registration of sleep (actigraphy), subjective sleepiness (KSS) and psychomotor performance (PVT). Based on a linear mixed model for repeated measurements, the new shift system increased the main sleep length after the night shift and improved alertness and PVT performance during the night shift among the older workers. Alertness also improved during free-time after the night shift and sleep complaints decreased after all shifts. The workers on the new shift schedule perceived the effects of the new shift system on sleep, alertness, general health, well-being at work, social and family life more positively than the workers in the old shift system. At the end of the study, all subjects voted for the new shift system. It is concluded that although the new shift system increased the operating hours at night, the very rapidly forward rotating shift system had positive effects on the sleep, alertness and well-being of especially the older shift workers."
"The study was conducted on 48 free-moving male rats to find out the role of the medial preoptic alpha2 receptors in the regulation of sleep and body temperature. Recording electrodes for assessment of sleep-wakefulness, and injector cannulae for injection of drugs in the medial preoptic area were chronically fixed on the skulls of the animals. The noradrenergic fibres projecting to the medial preoptic area were destroyed in 24 rats by administration of 6-hydroxydopamine at the ventral noradrenergic bundle. Though arousal was produced in normal rats by the injection of the alpha2 adrenergic agonist, clonidine, at the medial preoptic area, it induced sedation in rats with noradrenergic fibre lesion. Clonidine did not alter the rectal temperature in normal rats but it induced hypothermia in lesioned rats. Injection of alpha2 antagonist, yohimbine, at the medial preoptic area induced sleep in rats with intact noradrenergic fibres. However, the sleep inducing effect of this drug was very much attenuated in the lesioned animals. There was no significant change in body temperature, in both these groups of animals, after yohimbine administration. The study indicates the role of presynaptic alpha2 adrenergic receptors in arousal response and indirectly supports the contention that the alpha1 postsynaptic receptors at the medial preoptic area are involved in hypnogenesis. It also suggests that the thermal changes induced by adrenergic system are mediated through alpha1 postsynaptic receptors. But the thermal changes do not contribute towards the induced alterations in sleep-wakefulness. It is proposed that there should be separate sets of noradrenergic terminals for regulation of sleep and body temperature."
"Orexins (also called hypocretins), which are neuropeptides exclusively expressed by a population of neurons specifically localized in the lateral hypothalamic area, are critically implicated in the regulation of sleep/wake states. Orexin deficiency results in narcoleptic phenotype in rodents, dogs, and humans, suggesting that orexins are important for maintaining consolidated wakefulness states. However, the physiological effect of constitutive increased orexinergic transmission tone, which might be important for understanding the effects of orexin agonists that are promising candidates for therapeutic agents of narcolepsy, has not been fully characterized. We report here the sleep/wakefulness abnormalities in transgenic mice that exhibit widespread overexpression of a rat prepro-orexin transgene driven by a beta-actin/cytomegalovirus hybrid promoter (CAG/orexin transgenic mice). CAG/orexin mice exhibit sleep abnormalities with fragmentation of non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep episode and a reduction in REM sleep. Non-REM sleep was frequently disturbed by short episodes of wakefulness. EEG/EMG studies also reveal incomplete REM sleep atonia with abnormal myoclonic activity during this sleep stage. These results suggest that endogenous orexinergic activity should be appropriately regulated for normal maintenance of sleep states. Orexinergic transmission should be activated during wakefulness, while it should be inactivated or decreased during sleep state to maintain appropriate vigilance states."
"Experiments consisting of baseline, bright light and physical exercise studies were carried out to compare the effect of a 9-hour delay in sleep-wakefulness timing, and the effects of bright light and physical exercise interventions on 24-hour patterns of performance, mood and body temperature were examined. Each study comprised a 24-hour constant routine at the beginning followed by 3 night shifts and 24-hour constant routine at the end. Performance on tasks differing in cognitive load, mood and body temperature was measured during each constant routine and the interventions were applied during the night shifts. The 24-hour pattern of alertness and performance on the tasks with low cognitive load in post-treatment conditions followed the change in sleep-wakefulness timing while more cognitively loaded tasks tended to show a reverse trend when compared to pre-treatment conditions. There was a phase delay around 4 hours in circadian rhythms of body temperature in post-treatment conditions."
"This study was aimed at correlating diurnal changes in thermal preference of rats with their body temperature (Tb), sleep-wakefulness (S-W) and locomotor activity (LMA). Electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), electrooculogram (EOG) and Tb were recorded by telemetry, while an activity monitor measured LMA and thermal preference. A special environmental chamber, which was designed and fabricated, enabled for the first time, simultaneous measurement of thermal preference, along with S-W and Tb. S-W, thermal preference and LMA were recorded continuously in six adult male Wistar rats, for 24 h, for 3 days, and Tb with thermal preference and LMA were recorded for another 3 days. LMA and Tb were higher at night than during day. The rats slept less during the night time. Increased frequency of sleep episodes contributed towards increased sleep during day time. They preferred an ambient temperature (Tamb) of 24 degrees C at night and 27 degrees C during the day. Though the preference for higher Tamb during day time coincided with increased sleep, the rats did not move over to higher Tamb prior to the onset of sleep episodes. Though the diurnal alterations in sleep, Tb and LMA were similar to those reports from animals kept in constant Tamb, the day-night variation of paradoxical sleep (PS) was exaggerated when the rats selected their own preferred Tamb."
"Binge alcohol drinking, a risky pattern of alcohol consumption, has severe consequences toward health and well-being of an individual, his family, and society. Although, binge drinking has detrimental effects on sleep, underlying mechanisms are unknown. We used adult male C57BL/6J mice and exposed them to a single, 4-h session of binge alcohol self-administration, in stress-free environment, to examine neuronal mechanisms affecting sleep. We first verified binge pattern of alcohol consumption. When allowed to self-administer alcohol in a non-stressful environment, mice consumed alcohol in a binge pattern. Next, effect of binge drinking on sleep-wakefulness was monitored. While sleep-wakefulness remained unchanged during drinking session, significant increase in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep was observed during 4 h of active period post-binge, followed by increased wakefulness, reduced sleep during subsequent sleep (light) period; although the timing of sleep onset (at lights-on) remained unaffected. Next, electrophysiological and biochemical indicators of sleep homeostasis were examined using sleep deprivation-recovery sleep paradigm. Mice exposed to binge drinking did not show an increase in cortical theta power and basal forebrain adenosine levels during sleep deprivation; NREM sleep and NREM delta power did not increase during recovery sleep suggesting that mice exposed to binge alcohol do not develop sleep pressure. Our final experiment examined expression of genes regulating sleep homeostasis following binge drinking. While binge drinking did not affect adenosine kinase and A1 receptor, expression of equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) was significantly reduced. These results suggest that binge alcohol consumption-induced down-regulation of ENT1 expression may disrupt sleep homeostasis and cause sleep disturbances.

"BACKGROUND: Binge alcohol drinking is among the most common pattern of alcohol consumption in our society. Binge alcohol consumption has serious negative consequence on mental and physical health. Although alcohol consumption is known to have profound impact on sleep, it is yet unknown as to how binge alcohol affects/alters sleep-wakefulness. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of acute binge alcohol administration on sleep-wakefulness. METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats were used in the study. Under standard aseptic surgical conditions, rats (N = 7) were implanted with sleep-recording electrodes. After postoperative recovery and habituation, baseline sleep-wakefulness was recorded. Subsequently, rats were exposed to binge alcohol treatment as follows: One hour before light onset, a priming dose of 5 g/kg of alcohol was administered followed by 2 subsequent doses (adjusted based on the intoxication level of the rat) approximately 8 hours apart. Sleep-wakefulness was continuously recorded for 3 days post-binge. RESULTS: Acute binge alcohol administration had no significant effect on sleep-wakefulness on post-binge Day 1. However, on post-binge Day 2, after blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was 0, sleep disruptions were observed manifested by a reversal of sleep-wakefulness as evident from insomnia-like symptoms (significant increase in wakefulness; significant reduction in nonrapid eye movement [NREM] sleep) during the normal sleep (light) period and excessive sleep (significant increase in NREM sleep) during the normal active (dark) period similar to excessive daytime sleepiness in humans. All sleep-wakefulness changes were normalized on Day 3 post-binge. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol hangover is defined as the presence of unpleasant symptoms that peak when BAC is 0. Our results suggest that the reversal of sleep-wakefulness accompanies alcohol hangover after binge alcohol administration."
"A medium-sized portable digital recorder with fully integrated circuit (IC) memories for sleep monitoring has been developed. It has five amplifiers for EEG, EMG, EOG, ECG, and a signal of body acceleration or respiration sound, four event markers, an 8 ch A/D converter, a digital signal processor (DSP), 192 Mbytes IC flash memories, and batteries. The whole system weighs 1200 g including batteries and is put into a small bag worn on the subject's waist or carried in their hand. The sampling rate for each input channel is programmable through the DSP. This apparatus is valuable for continuously monitoring the states of sleep-wakefulness over 24 h, making a night-day-night recording possible in a hospital, home, or car."
"Emotionally salient situations usually trigger arousal along with autonomic and neuroendocrine reactions. To determine whether the extended amygdala plays a role in sleep-wakefulness regulation, we examined the effects of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic excitation of GABAergic neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (GABA(BNST) neurons). Acute optogenetic excitation of these cells during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep resulted in an immediate state transition to wakefulness, whereas stimulation during REM sleep showed no effect on sleep-wakefulness states in male mice. An anterograde tracing study suggested GABA(BNST) neurons send axonal projections to several brain regions implicated in arousal, including the preoptic area, lateral hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, deep mesencephalic nucleus, and parabrachial nucleus. A dual orexin receptor antagonist, DORA-22, did not affect the optogenetic transition from NREM sleep to wakefulness. Chemogenetic excitation of GABA(BNST) neurons evoked a sustained wakefulness state, but this arousal effect was markedly attenuated by DORA-22. These observations suggest that GABA(BNST) neurons play an important role in transition from NREM sleep to wakefulness without the function of orexin neurons, but prolonged excitation of these cells mobilizes the orexin system to sustain wakefulness.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We examined the role of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the regulation of wakefulness. Optogenetic excitation of GABAergic neurons in the BNST (GABA(BNST) neurons) during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in mice resulted in immediate transition to a wakefulness state without function of orexins. Prolonged excitation of GABA(BNST) neurons by a chemogenetic method evoked a longer-lasting, sustained wakefulness state, which was abolished by preadministration of a dual orexin receptor antagonist, DORA-22. This study revealed a role of the BNST GABAergic system in sleep-wakefulness control, especially in shifting animals' behavioral states from NREM sleep to wakefulness, and provides an important insight into the pathophysiology of insomnia and the role of orexin in arousal regulation."
"Mother rats spend most of their time nursing their litter during the early stages of the postpartum period, only occasionally leaving the nest. The suckling stimulus from the pups elicits the adoption of nursing postures, during which milk ejection occurs, an event associated with the occurrence of non-REM (NREM) sleep in the rat. Despite this evidence, the characteristics of sleep during different nursing postures along the postpartum period remain unknown. The present study aims to describe the sleep pattern of mother rats while nursing, hovering over their pups and when being away from the pups. For this purpose, lactating females were implanted with electrodes for chronic polysomnographic recording. Simultaneous recordings of sleep-wakefulness cycle and maternal behaviors were performed in both the light and dark phases of the first and second postpartum weeks. Results indicate that while mothers were most of the time awake when hovering over pups and when staying away from pups, they mainly remained in NREM sleep when adopting low kyphosis posture, the most common nursing posture. The sleep-wake pattern during most maternal behaviors was quite stable between the light and dark phases of the first and second postpartum weeks. In addition, the sleep fragmentation was higher during the nursing bouts compared to that observed when mother rats slept without the pups, but sleep depth did not differ between these behaviors. Our results provide an original description of how mother rats synchronize their own sleep-wakefulness cycle with the maternal care of the pups during the postpartum period."
"Changes in sleep-wakefulness (S-W) were studied in adult male Wistar rats, along with body temperature (T(b)), locomotor activity (LMA) and thermal preference, after the lesion of the medial preoptic area (mPOA) with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA). The sleep was decreased after the lesion of the mPOA, but there was recovery when the rats were given freedom to stay in an ambient temperature (T(amb)) which they preferred. When given a choice between three T(amb) (24, 27 and 30 degrees C), the rats preferred 27 degrees C before the mPOA lesion, and 24 degrees C during the initial days after the lesion. There was a shift in the thermal preference to 30 degrees C, on the fourth week after the lesion, which coincided with the considerable recovery of sleep. The preference for higher T(amb) probably helped to improve sleep, as T(amb) of 30 degrees C is known to promote sleep. When the lesioned rats were not given the freedom to select the T(amb), there was no recovery in sleep. The mPOA seems to be essential for increasing the durations of slow wave sleep (SWS) episodes, especially the light SWS (S1), as they remained shorter than the pre-lesion value, even when the rats were given freedom to stay in a preferred T(amb). The homeostatic recovery of sleep, especially the night time sleep, resulted in the disruption of circadian sleep rhythm. But, the LMA, T(b) and thermal preference maintained their diurnal variation. T(b) and LMA were elevated after the mPOA lesion and they remained so till the end of the study."
"Melatonin promotes sleep. However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Orexin neurons in the perifornical lateral hypothalamus (PFH) are pivotal for wake promotion. Does melatonin promote sleep by inhibiting orexin neurons? We used C57BL/6J mice and designed 4 experiments to address this question. Experiment 1 used double-labeled immunofluorescence and examined the presence of melatonin receptors on orexin neurons. Second, mice, implanted with bilateral guides targeted toward PFH and sleep-recording electrodes, were infused with melatonin (500 pmole/50 nL/side) at dark onset (onset of active period), and spontaneous bouts of sleep-wakefulness were examined. Third, mice, implanted with bilateral guides into the PFH, were infused with melatonin (500 pmole/50 nL/side) at dark onset and euthanized 2 hours later, to examine the activation of orexin neurons using c-Fos expression in orexin neurons. Fourth, mice, implanted with PFH bilateral guides and sleep-recording electrodes, were infused with melatonin receptor antagonist, luzindole (10 pmol/50 nL/side), at light onset (onset of sleep period), and spontaneous bouts of sleep-wakefulness were examined. Our results suggest that orexin neurons express MT1, but not MT2 receptors. Melatonin infusion into the PFH, at dark onset, site-specifically and significantly increased NREM sleep (43.7%, P = .003) and reduced wakefulness (12.3%, P = .013). Local melatonin infusion at dark onset inhibited orexin neurons as evident by a significant reduction (66%, P = .0004) in the number of orexin neurons expressing c-Fos. Finally, luzindole infusion-induced blockade of melatonin receptors in PFH at sleep onset significantly increased wakefulness (44.1%, P = .015). Based on these results, we suggest that melatonin may act via the MT1 receptors to inhibit orexin neurons and promote sleep."
"The changes in sleep-wakefulness were studied in rats during their exposure to different ambient temperatures of 18 degrees C, 24 degrees C and 30 degrees C, before and after the destruction of the medial preoptic area neurons by N-Methyl D-aspartic acid. In normal rats, there was an increase in paradoxical sleep and slow wave sleep and a decrease in wakefulness at higher ambient temperatures. The increase in sleep was primarily due to an increase in the duration of sleep episodes. Destruction of the medial preoptic area neurons produced a decrease in sleep at all three different ambient temperatures. But, there was a linear increase in sleep with higher temperatures in the lesioned rats that was qualitatively different from that in the normal animals, as the increase in sleep was associated with an increase in the number of short duration slow wave sleep episodes. The findings indicate that the medial preoptic area is essential for sleep maintenance and improving the quality of sleep with higher ambient temperatures. It is possible that the medial preoptic area serves as a fine-tuning mechanism to regulate sleep for energy homeostasis, including thermoregulation."
"The effect of chlorogenic acid on the sleep-wakefulness cycle in rats was investigated in comparison with those of caffeic acid (the metabolite of chlorogenic acid) and dihydrocaffeic acid (the metabolite of caffeic acid). A significant prolongation of sleep latency was observed with chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid at a dose of 500 and 200 mg/kg, respectively. On the other hand, no remarkable effects were observed with dihydrocaffeic acid even at a dose of 500 mg/kg. Caffeine caused a significant increase in sleep latency and waking time and decrease in non-rapid eye movement sleep time at a dose of 10 mg/kg. In contrast, chlorogenic acid and its metabolites had no significant effects on each sleep state. From these results, it may be concluded that chrologenic acid caused a mild arousal effect compared with that of caffeine, and the effect of chlorogenic acid may have occurred through its metabolite caffeic acid."
"Nicotine and alcohol co-abuse is highly prevalent, although the underlying causes are unclear. It has been suggested that nicotine enhances pleasurable effects of alcohol while reducing aversive effects. Recently, we reported that nicotine acts via the basal forebrain (BF) to activate nucleus accumbens and increase alcohol consumption. Does nicotine suppress alcohol-induced aversive effects via the BF? We hypothesized that nicotine may act via the BF to suppress sleep-promoting effects of alcohol. To test this hypothesis, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with sleep-recording electrodes and bilateral guides targeted toward the BF. Nicotine (75 pmol/500 nL/side) or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; 500 nL/side) was microinjected into the BF followed by intragastric alcohol (ACSF + EtOH and NiC + EtOH groups; 3 g/kg) or water (NiC + W and ACSF + W groups; 10 mL/kg) administration. On completion, rats were killed and processed to localize injection sites in the BF. The statistical analysis revealed a significant effect of treatment on sleep-wakefulness. While rats exposed to alcohol (ACSF + EtOH) displayed strong sleep promotion, nicotine pre-treatment in the BF (NiC + EtOH) attenuated alcohol-induced sleep and normalized sleep-wakefulness. These results suggest that nicotine acts via the BF to suppress the aversive, sleep-promoting effects of alcohol, further supporting the role of BF in alcohol-nicotine co-use."
"In chronic experiments influence of single administration of various doses of morphine (0.5, 2.0 and 3.0 mg/kg) on general behavior, structural organization of the sleep-waking cycle and some EEG and somato-vegetative parameters was studied in the cats. Intraperitoneal administration of morphine elicits numerous autonomic disorders, psychic derangement and complete deterioration of the sleep-waking cycle structure. The result certify that single administration of morphine induces activation of the opiate receptors in various structures of the brain, which entails deviations of behavioral and EEG parameters, activation of the structures responsible for initiation of behavioral waking, suppression of activity in those structure, which control the slow wave sleep triggering mechanisms, deterioration of the sleep quality and significant elevation of emotional tension against the baseline. On the basis of obtained data it is suggested that the opioid system plays an important role in the sleep-waking cycle regulatory mechanisms and other forms of brain integrative activity in general."
"Previous studies have demonstrated that the activation of orexinergic neurons facilitates the recovery of animals from general anesthesia. Moreover, serotonergic neurons that receive projections from orexin neurons have also been shown to participate in sleep-wakefulness regulation. In the present study, we aimed to explore whether orexinergic neurons facilitate emergence from isoflurane anesthesia in rats by activating serotonergic neurons. Orexin A (30 or 100pmol), orexin B (30 or 100pmol), and their respective antagonists SB-334867 and TCS-OX2-29 (5 or 20mug) were microinjected into the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) of rats, and their effects on induction and emergence times were analyzed. Electroencephalogram (EEG) changes were also recorded and analyzed to illuminate the effect of orexin injection into the DRN on cortical excitability under isoflurane anesthesia. Activation of serotonergic neurons was detected via immunohistochemical analysis of c-Fos expression following orexin administration. Our results indicated that injection of neither orexins nor orexin antagonists into the rat DRN exerted an impact on induction time, whereas orexin-A injection (100pmol) enhanced arousal when compared with the saline group. In contrast, administration of orexin receptor type 1 antagonist SB-334867 (20mug) prolonged emergence time from isoflurane anesthesia. Microinjection of orexin-A induced an arousal pattern on EEG, and decreased the burst suppression ratio under isoflurane anesthesia. Isoflurane anesthesia inhibited the activity of serotonergic neurons, as shown by decrease in the number of c-Fos-immunoreactive serotonergic neurons when compared with the sham group. This inhibitory effect was partially reversed by administration of orexin-A. Taken together, our findings suggest that orexinergic signals facilitate emergence from isoflurane anesthesia, at least partially, by reversing the effects of isoflurane on serotonergic neurons of the DRN."
"Cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine tegmentum nucleus (PPT) are crucial for initiation and maintenance of electroencephalographic (EEG) desynchronization states like paradoxical sleep and wakefulness. These neurons are regulated by classical neurotransmitter systems from the pontomesencephalic reticular formation and basal ganglia. In addition to this regulation, PPT neuron activity could be modulated by endogenous neurosteroids and particularly by pregnenolone sulfate (PREG-S) because synthesis enzymes of this neurosteroid are present in this area and peripheral administrations of PREG-S affect sleep-wakefulness states. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effects of different doses of PREG-S infusion into the PPT on sleep-wakefulness states in rats. Our results show dose-dependent effects of PREG-S on sleep-wakefulness states. Low concentration of PREG-S (5 ng) increased the amount of paradoxical sleep without any modification of slow wave sleep and wakefulness. High level of PREG-S (10 and 20 ng) increased paradoxical sleep and slow wave sleep together with an increase of delta power and a decrease of theta power during wakefulness. Dependent on the doses used, PREG-S thus can promote paradoxical sleep alone or the global propensity to fall asleep, impairing the quality of wakefulness. These results unveil a new regulation pathway for PPT neurons and strengthen the role of PREG-S in sleep-wakefulness regulation."
"Intracerebral microinjections of gamma amino butyric acid were given bilaterally at the medial preoptic area (mPOA) to determine the possible role of this neurotransmitter in the genesis and regulation of sleep-wakefulness. GABA (50 micrograms/0.2 microliters) when administered through chronically implanted cannulae in free moving rats, did not produce any significant alterations in sleep-wakefulness. This may be attributed either to the non-involvement of GABA at the level of mPOA in the regulation of sleep, or to other factors like the low dose and rapid breakdown of the injected drug."
"The development of circadian sleep-wakefulness rhythm was investigated by a longitudinal study of two normal newborns for two and a half years and by a transversal study of 182 normal infants and young children living in three different areas of Japan. The circadian rhythm became established before 4 months of age, and daytime sleep became concentrated within two time periods from 7 months of age, and then within a single peak from 14 months of age. The time period 00:00-04:00 developed into the ""absolute sleep period"" from 3 months of age, and the ""absolute wakefulness period"" appeared first in the time period 08:00-11:00 from 14 months of age, and then in the time period 16:00-21:00 from one and a half years of age. Establishment of circadian rhythm as indicated by the numbers of sleep epochs in daytime and in nighttime, and the longest continuous sleep or wakefulness periods reflect the development of the nervous system and were influenced by the change of light-dark in the environment. These parameters showed critical ages, but not sexual or regional differences. However, regional differences were found in the times of waking up in morning and falling asleep at night. This indicated the phase of the circadian rhythm was also influenced by natural and social environmental factors."
"The effects of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine (DOPS), a nonnatural precursor of noradrenaline, on the sleep-wakefulness patterns of rats were studied. When the animals received an intraperitoneal injection of L-erythro-DOPS (200 mg/kg), a significant increase in slow wave sleep and a tendency to decrease wakefulness were observed during the first 2 hours after the injection. Paradoxical sleep increased 4-8 hours after the treatment. A simultaneous injection of benserazide (20 mg/kg) enhanced these effects. L-threo-DOPS (200 mg/kg, i.p.) had no effect on the sleep-wakefulness patterns. The effects of DOPS on the concentrations of brain catecholamines and serotonin in rats were also examined. An intraperitoneal injection of L-erythro-DOPS markedly increased the concentration of noradrenaline (probably the d-form) and decreased that of serotonin and dopamine. L-threo-DOPS had no effect on the brain monoamine levels of the rats in the present experimental condition. The effects of L-erythro-DOPS on the neurons containing noradrenaline in the rats were examined by fluorescence histochemistry. Fluorescence in the neuronal perikarya and fibers containing noradrenaline markedly increased in the n. coeruleus, n. paraventricularis and cerebral cortex after an intraperitoneal injection of amino acid. Fibers containing the fluorescence also increased in the second two areas."
"In the present study, using an automatic method to discriminate the stages of sleep-wakefulness, 180 control recordings on 15 chronically implanted cats were examined. In addition to a quantitative analysis, some aspects of the sleep-wakefulness architecture were considered, especially the nature and the distribution of the sleep phases that lead to paradoxical sleep (normal sequences) or to wakefulness (abortive sequences). Taken together, these features allow the definition of a 'control profile' which could be useful for the better characterization of drug effects."
"The effects of glutaurine (gamma-L-glutamyl taurine, Litoralon, Chinoin, Budapest) on the aggressive behaviour and sleep-wakefulness cycle were studied in freely moving cats. Glutaurine, even in doses as low as 0.1 microgram/kg, was found significantly to shorten the latency of the rat-killing reaction elicited by hypothalamic stimulation. On the other hand, the same doses failed to modify the sleep-wakefulness cycle to any significant degree throughout the study period of 4 hours. On the grounds of these and previous data, the possible brain site of the glutaurine action is discussed."
"The role of the medial preoptic area (mPOA) beta adrenergic receptors in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness (S-W) was investigated in this study. S-W was assessed on the basis of polygraphic recording of EEG, EMG and EOG in free moving rats. Intracerebral microinjection of beta agonist, isoproterenol, into the mPOA produced arousal. The study was also conducted on another set of rats in which noradrenergic (NE) innervation to the mPOA was destroyed by injecting 6-hydroxydopamine into the ventral noradrenergic bundle, in the brain stem. Local application of isoproterenol, into the mPOA, in these animals, did not produce any significant change in S-W. Thus, the increase in awake period obtained on isoproterenol administration was the result of its action on the presynaptic NE terminals. Possible involvement of other responses in the isoproterenol induced increase in wakefulness, is discussed."
"The temporal pattern of growth hormone (GH) secretion throughout a day and its correlation with the sleep-wakefulness cycle in the 29-31-day-old female rat were studied by serial blood sampling through an intracardiac cannula at 10-min intervals. Electroencephalograms (e.e.g.s) recorded continuously during blood sampling periods were scored into wakefulness and sleep, and the amount of sleep for every 10 min was plotted against the GH value as assessed by radio-immunoassay. B analysis of the power spectrum using the least-squares method, the time series of GH concentration was found to have a periodicity of approximately 3.0 h in any of the 6-h periods sampled, beginning at 12.00, 18.00, 00.00 and 06.00 h, and in either sex. The peak time which was estimated for the time series of GH concentrations was found to occur consistently around 02.00-03.00, 05.00-06.00, 08.00-09.00, 11.00-12.00, 14.00-15.00, 17.00-18.00, 20.00-21.00 and 23.00-24.00 h in either the male or the female rat. The cross-correlation analysis performed between the time series of the amount of sleep and the GH concentration, which were obtained for the 6-h period from 12.00 to 18.00 h, revealed a significant positive correlation between the GH level and the amount of sleep during the preceding 10 min. The time series of the amount of sleep over a 24-h period from the data obtained in the continuous recording of e.e.g.s from 27 to 31 days of age revealed an ultradian rhythm with a periodicity of approximately 3.0 h. These findings indicate that the rat GH secretory rhythm with a 3.0-h periodicity develops by 30 days of age in both sexes, relating to the 3.0-h-period ultradian rhythm of the sleep-wakefulness cycle entrained by the light cycle."
"Ghrelin, a gut and brain peptide, is a potent stimulant for growth hormone (GH) secretion and feeding. Recent studies further show a critical role of ghrelin in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness. Laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT), that regulates waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, expresses GH secretagogue receptors (GHS-Rs). Thus, the present study was carried out to examine electrophysiological effects of ghrelin on LDT neurons using rat brainstem slices, and to determine the ionic mechanism involved. Whole cell recording revealed that ghrelin depolarizes LDT neurons dose-dependently in normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). The depolarization persisted in tetrodotoxin-containing ACSF (TTX ACSF), and is partially blocked by the application of [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6, a selective antagonist for GHS-Rs. Membrane resistance during the ghrelin-induced depolarization increased by about 18% than that before the depolarization. In addition, the ghrelin-induced depolarization was drastically reduced in high-K+ TTX ACSF with a K+ concentration of 13.25 mM. Reversal potentials obtained from I-V curves before and during the depolarization were about -83 mV, close to the equilibrium potential of the K+ channel. Most of the LDT neurons recorded were characterized by an A-current or both the A-current and a low threshold Ca2+ spike, and they were predominantly cholinergic. These results indicate that ghrelin depolarizes LDT neurons postsynaptically and dose-dependently via GHS-Rs, and that the ionic mechanisms underlying the ghrelin-induced depolarization include a decrease of K+ conductance. The results also suggest that LDT neurons are implicated in the cellular processes through which ghrelin participates in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness."
"In freely moving rats the dynamics of neuronal activity of the amygdaloid complex was studied during the sleep-wakefulness cycle. It has been shown that the majority of neurons in the dorsomedial part of the complex discharge with high frequencies during active wakefulness (80%) and paradoxical sleep (66.7%) as compared with slow wave sleep. The neuronal activity of the basolateral part of the complex during the sleep-wakefulness cycle is more diverse: most of the neurons (84.6%) are activated during wakefulness, while only 38.4% of neurons are activated during parodoxical sleep. Some neurons show higher frequency during slow-wave sleep discharges. The above-mentioned findings show that the neuronal activity of the dorsomedial and basolateral amygdaloid complex differs in the sleep-wakefulness cycle. It is suggested that this complex must play an important role in the regulation of motivational processes, while it is not involved in the basic mechanisms of the sleep-wakefulness cycle."
"As a result of factor analysis of the structure of the cat sleep--wakefulness cycle, six factors have been defined, regarded as factors of ""paradoxical sleep"", ""structure of slow-wave sleep"", ""transitions or delta-sleep"", ""sleep of medium depth"", ""stage of sleep spindles"" and ""delta sleep"". Along with the detected certain independence of the apparatuses controlling individual sleep stages it was shown that mechanisms of paradoxical sleep may determine the organization of the entire sleep--wakefulness cycle, representing a peculiar system-forming factor. A considerable part in cessation of the fast sleep, as well as in the sleep general mechanisms is played by the apparatuses responsible for the transitional processes between the stages."
"Existing data indicate that sleep-wakefulness is an essential behavior. The biological function(s) of sleep, however, remains unknown, due, in part, to the lack of information available at the intracellular level. Preliminary microarray analyses show that changes in behavioral state influence regional mRNA profiles; however, the impact of sleep on protein signatures is virtually unexplored. In these studies, cortical protein profiles were examined after timed bouts of spontaneous sleep-wakefulness. Within minutes of each behavioral state examined, a small number of spots showing unique expression were detected. Mass spectroscopy analyses of sleep- and wake-related spots identified proteins associated with multiple functional categories. Two sleep-associated proteins were further validated using a sleep deprivation paradigm. We found preliminary evidence for two different post-transcriptional mechanisms-one (GAPDH) in which the amount of protein was increased in the recovery sleep following prolonged waking, while the other (actin) suggested that post-translational modifications may underlie sleep. The similarities between the effects of sleep on both protein and mRNA profiles indicate that dynamic intracellular changes underlie sleep-wake states and are consistent with roles for sleep in multiple biological functions."
The effects of the repeated administration of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol on sleep-wakefulness patterns were studied in adult male squirrel monkeys. The percent time spent in slow wave sleep was reduced with chronic treatment and failed to return to base line levels after 30 days of recovery. The amount of time spent in Stage 1 or drowsy state increased with repeated treatment and remained elevated through recovery. Changes observed in other stages of sleep-wakefulness were sensitive to repeated treatment with marijuana but were found to return to base line levels during recovery.
"The structure of the sleep-wakefulness cycle on the white rats with experimental parkinsonian syndrome was investigated, which was induced by administration of MPTP and oxotremorine. The EEG was recorded during 6 hours. The recordings were made 1.5 hours after the administration of the drugs. It was established that MPTP and oxotremorine broke the structure of the sleep-wakefulness cycle almost with complete reduction of paradoxal sleep and the decrease of SWS. The number of sleep spindles was reduced and changed the characteristics of the hippocampal theta rhythms. MPTP induces weakness of the phasic compound and strengthens the tonic compound."
"The circadian system is synchronized on 24-hour by the light-dark synchronizer and by the social time cue. The circadian rhythm sleep disorders share a common underlying chronobiological basis. These disorders may be due to either jet-lag, shift-work or to lesions of the peripheral visual pathway. The delayed sleep phase syndrome, the advanced sleep phase syndrome, the non 24-hour syndrome as well as the irregular sleep-wake patterns are described. Therapeutic approaches, in particular with melatonin and (or) bright light, are presented."
"Ontogenesis of circadian sleep-wakefulness rhythms and other developmental changes of sleep were examined in the altricial rat and in the precocial guinea pig. Circadian sleep-wakefulness rhythms began to emerge on the 4th-4.5th week after birth in rats born and raised not only under light-dark (LD) 12:12 h lighting schedule but also under a constant light condition. Only ultradian rhythms were recognized in the rat up to 2.5-3.5 weeks after birth. Unlike the rat, the guinea pig did not develop significant diurnal and circadian sleep rhythms during the course of its growth. Sleep-wakefulness rhythms of the 1-week-old infant guinea pig were very similar to those of the adult. During the development of the altricial rat the periods of slow wave sleep (SWS) and paradoxical sleep (PS) cycles, and the amounts of SWS per day increased. On the other hand, the amounts of PS per day and the length of the PS episodes decreased. For the guinea pig, however, these parameters of sleep were apparently constant throughout development."
"The effect of timiperone, a new antipsychotic drug, on the sleep-wakefulness cycle in cats was assessed by EEG, EMG and eye movement potential. Timiperone (0.03 to 0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently increased the slow wave sleep (SWS) time and decreased the paradoxical sleep (PS) time. Further, the onset of the first period of PS was delayed, and the number of PS phases tended to be decreased after the 0.3 mg/kg dose. These results suggest that the neurological control of the cerebral dopaminergic system might be at least in part attributable to the effect of timiperone on sleep mechanisms."
"Investigations with four dihydrogenated ergot alkaloids, dihydroergotoxine, dihydroergonine, dihydroergostine and dihydro-beta-ergosine indicate that they exert similar dose dependent effects on the sleep-wakefulness cycle of the rat. The duration of wakefulness was increased, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and, in particular, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were shortened. 5-Hydroxytryptophan, but not apomorphine, induced similar changes of the rat sleep-wakefulness cycle. Neurochemical studies on rat brain biogenic amines indicate that dihydroergotoxine lowers homovanillic acid (HVA) levels and reduces HVA elevations after morphine or haloperidol in the striatum. In addition, the turnover of serotonin was slowed down and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) content in the whole brain was reduced. 5-HIAA elevation induced by clozapine was inhibited. These results suggest that the electroencephalographic changes in the rat produced by treatment with dihydrogenated ergot alkaloids reflect an enhanced level of vigilance and could be related to changes of brain biogenic amine metabolism."
"Substance P (SP) has been characterized as an excitatory neurotransmitter and/or neuromodulator in the peripheral and central nervous systems. It is involved in mediating various biological functions such as smooth muscle contraction, neuronal excitation, and pain transmission. Although Lieb et al. reported that intravenous infusion of SP into healthy men led to an increase of paradoxical sleep latency and time awake, little is known about the function and target of SP on sleep-wakefulness cycle in the central nervous system. The ventrolateral preoptic area (vLPO) plays an important role in modulation of sleep-wakefulness cycle. The present study investigated the effect of SP on sleep-wakefulness cycle in the vLPO of rats. Slow wave sleep (SWS) was enhanced after SP was microinjected into bilateral vLPO, while SP receptor antagonist, N-acetyl-l-tryptophan 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-benzyl ester, led to the opposite effect. The effect induced by SP was blocked by U73122, a phospholipase C inhibitor. In addition, 3-mercaptopropionic acid, a glutamic acid decarboxylase inhibitor that inhibits gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis and release, blocked the SP-induced sleep-promoting effect in the vLPO. These results indicate that SP has sleep-promoting effect in the vLPO possibly by GABAergic neurons."
"Ghrelin is a potent stimulant for growth hormone (GH) secretion and feeding. Recent studies further show a critical role of ghrelin in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness. Pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT), which regulates waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, expresses GH secretagogue receptors (GHS-Rs). Thus, the present study was carried out to examine electrophysiological effects of ghrelin on PPT neurons using rat brainstem slices, and to determine the ionic mechanism involved. Whole cell recording revealed that ghrelin depolarizes PPT neurons dose-dependently in normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). The depolarization persisted in tetrodotoxin-containing ACSF, although action potentials did not occur. Application of [d-Lys(3)]-GHRP-6, a selective antagonist for GHS-Rs, almost blocked the ghrelin-induced depolarization. Furthermore, the ghrelin-induced depolarization was reduced in high K(+) ACSF or low Na(+) ACSF, and abolished in high K(+)-low Na(+) ACSF or in a combination of low Na(+) ACSF and recordings with Cs(+)-containing pipettes. An inhibitor of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger had no effect on the depolarization. Most of the PPT neurons recorded were characterized by an A-current or both the A-current and a low threshold Ca(2+) spike, and they were predominantly cholinergic as revealed by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase staining. These results suggest that ghrelin depolarizes PPT neurons postsynaptically and dose-dependently via GHS-Rs, and that the ionic mechanisms underlying the ghrelin-induced depolarization include a decrease of K(+) conductance and an increase of non-selective cationic conductance. The results also support the notion that ghrelin plays a role in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness."
"The study is aimed at investigating the possible involvement of adrenergic mechanisms in the medial preoptic area (mPOA) for modulation of sleep-wakefulness in rats. In this study, saline, norepinephrine (NE), phenoxybenzamine (PBZ) and propranolol (PROP) were injected in the mPOA in different groups of male rats during the day and night. NE and PBZ were injected, during the day and the night respectively, in some control areas adjoining the mPOA in two other groups of animals. Arousal was produced by NE, and sleep by PBZ when they were applied in the mPOA. All other procedures, including application of NE and PBZ in the control areas and beta blocker (PROP) in the mPOA, did not produce alterations in sleep-wakefulness. These findings provide support for a physiological role played by the alpha adrenergic system in the mPOA for arousal, and area specificity of action of this system."
"Studies conducted on genes expression through the sleep-wake cycle and after sleep deprivation have revealed a number of genes that are more active during wakefulness/prolonged wakefulness than sleep, but also a few genes that are more active during sleep than wakefulness. Gene expression profiles during a specific vigilance state can be effectively monitored using microarrays, and when comparing profiles under different vigilance states, state-specific gene expression patterns can be precipitated. As such approach is random, and does not include any assumptions as to which genes would be expressed, it offers a non-biased view on the participation of different factors in the regulation of vigilance states. Combining results from different species offers a powerful tool for the analysis of genes that are involved in sleep-wake cycle regulation. The results of such assays are dependent on what area the tissue for the analysis is collected and the time point of the collection in respect to the duration of the specific vigilance state."
"Introduction and Aim: Researchers and specialists believe that health maintenance and improvement through university students, as a part of society, play a crucial role in community configuration which should not be ignored. Since there was a few studies in these fields, researchers have sought to explore how mentioned workshops is related to cognitive emotion regulation, anxiety, depression, and sleep quality for the student volunteers of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. Materials and Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, 152 students were allocated into the 3 equal groups (study1: ""perseverance workshop"" study2:""sleep and wakefulness workshop"" and control group). Data collection instruments were the Granovsky cognitive emotion regulation scale, the Beck depression and anxiety inventories and Pittsburgh sleep Quality Index (PSQI-P) Questionnaire. Results: The results of comparing the anxiety and depression between groups showed that there was a decreasing and significant trend in the two intervention groups, before and after the two workshops (P < 0.001). For PSQ analysis, within-group comparisons in those who have participated sleep and wakefulness workshop showed that the change trend was significant and in linear form. In addition, to compare those who have participated in perseverance workshop with the control group, there was a significant difference between the pretest and posttest results in the Cognitive Emotion Regulation subgroups. Conclusion: It can be said that the implementation of the workshops could improve the emotional state of the participants in comparison to the control group."
"Age-related changes in brain function include those affecting learning, memory, and sleep-wakefulness. Sleep-wakefulness is an essential behavior that results from the interaction of multiple brain regions, peptides, and neurotransmitters. The biological function(s) of sleep, however, remains unknown due to a paucity of information available at the cellular level. Aged rats exhibit alterations in the circadian and homeostatic influences associated with sleep-wake regulation. We recently showed that alterations in cortical profiles occur after timed bouts of spontaneous sleep in young rats. Examination of the cellular response to sleep-wake in old rats may thus provide insight(s) into the biological function(s) of sleep. To test this hypothesis, we monitored cortical profiles in the frontal cortex of young and old Sprague-Dawley rats after timed bouts of spontaneous sleep-wake behavior. Proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), visualized by fluorescent staining, imaged, and analyzed as a function of behavioral state and age. Old rats showed a 6-fold increase in total protein expression, independent of the behavioral state at sacrifice. When analyzed according to age and behavioral state, there was a decrease (approximately 46%) in the number of phospho-spots present during SWS in aged animals. SWS-associated spots present only in old animals were associated with multiple functions including vesicular transport, cell signaling, oxidation state, cytoskeletal support, and energy metabolism. These data suggest that the intracellular response to the signaling associated with spontaneous sleep is affected by age and is consistent with the idea that the ability of sleep to fulfill its function(s) may become diminished with age."
"In chronic experiments on cats, using the recording of local blood flow in different regions of the hypothalamus in the sleep-wakefulness cycle, it was found that during paradoxical sleep, the level of local blood flow in the posterior hypothalamus increased significantly, while at the same time in the anterior hypothalamus and in the preoptic region a sharp reduction takes place in local blood flow. In deep slow wave sleep the opposite pattern is observed: the level of local blood flow increases in the anterior hypothalamus and in the preoptic region, and decreases in the posterior hypothalamus. The conclusion is drawn that in one and the same sleep phase the diverse directionality of the changes in the level of local blood flow in the different regions of the hypothalamus must be associated with functional shifts in these structures, and the functional state of each of them in different phases of the sleep-wakefulness cycle is evaluated on the basis of this."
"OBJECTIVES: In critically ill patients, sleep derangements are reported to be severe using Rechtschaffen and Kales (R&K) methodology; however, whether such methodology can reliably assess sleep during critical illness is unknown. We set out to determine the reproducibility of 4 different sleep-assessment methods (3 manual and 1 computer-based) for ventilator-supported critically ill patients and also to quantify the extent to which the reproducibility of the manual methods for measuring sleep differed between critically ill and ambulatory (control) patients. DESIGN: Observational methodologic study. SETTING: Academic center. PATIENTS: Critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation and age-matched controls underwent polysomnography. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Reproducibility for the computer-based method (spectral analysis of electroencephalography [EEG]) was better than that for the manual methods: R&K methodology and sleep-wakefulness organization pattern (P = 0.03). In critically ill patients, the proportion of misclassifications for measurements using spectral analysis, sleep-wakefulness organization pattern, and R&K methodology were 0%, 36%, and 53%, respectively (P < 0.0001). The EEG pattern of burst suppression was not observed. Interobserver and intraobserver reliability of the manual sleep-assessment methods for critically ill patients (kappa = 0.52 +/- 0.23) was worse than that for control patients (kappa = 0.89 +/- 0.13; P = 0.03). In critically ill patients, the overall reliability of the R&K methodology was relatively low for assessing sleep (kappa = 0.19), but detection of rapid eye movement sleep revealed good agreement (kappa = 0.70). CONCLUSIONS: Reproducibility for spectral analysis of EEG was better than that for the manual methods: R&K methodology and sleep-wakefulness organization pattern. For assessment of sleep in critically ill patients, the use of spectral analysis, sleep-wakefulness organization state, or rapid eye movement sleep alone may be preferred over the R&K methodology."
"Hypnogenic structures are mainly located in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus. The number of Fos-immunoreactive neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic area (vlPOA) and in the median preoptic nucleus (MnPN) is positively correlated with the amount of preceding sleep. Majority of neurons recorded in these nuclei exhibit elevated discharge rates during sleep. Present study examined the effects of MnPN electrolytic lesion on the sleep-waking behavior in the rat. Experiments were performed on adult Mongrel albino male rats. Rats were implanted with EEG/EMG electrodes and with an electrode for MnPN lesion. Following a post-surgery recovery, rats were adapted to the recording environment, recorded for a baseline sleep-wakefulness cycle and then assigned to two groups. One group of rats was subjected to MnPN lesion and recorded for spontaneous sleep on the third, seventh and fourteenth days following the lesion procedure. Other rats served as a control group. The control and the MnPN-lesion rats exhibited different profiles of sleep-wakefulness organization. MnPN-lesion rats had significantly higher amounts of wakefulness and lower amounts of sleep, compared to control animals. Our findings support a view that the activity of a subset of MnPN neurons is strongly related to sleep regulation."
"The extracellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei causes human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness. Trypanosomes are transmitted by tsetse flies and HAT occurs in foci in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease, which is invariably lethal if untreated, evolves in a first hemo-lymphatic stage, progressing to a second meningo-encephalitic stage when the parasites cross the blood-brain barrier. At first, trypanosomes are restricted to circumventricular organs and choroid plexus in the brain outside the blood-brain barrier, and to dorsal root ganglia. Later, parasites cross the blood-brain barrier at post-capillary venules, through a multi-step process similar to that of lymphocytes. Accumulation of parasites in the brain is regulated by cytokines and chemokines. Trypanosomes can alter neuronal function and the most prominent manifestation is represented by sleep alterations. These are characterized, in HAT and experimental rodent infections, by disruption of the sleep-wake 24h cycle and internal sleep structure. Trypanosome infections alter also some, but not all, other endogenous biological rhythms. A number of neural pathways and molecules may be involved in such effects. Trypanosomes secrete prostaglandins including the somnogenic PGD2, and they interact with the host's immune system to cause release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. From the sites of early localization of parasites in the brain and meninges, such molecules could affect adjacent brain areas implicated in sleep-wakefulness regulation, including the suprachiasmatic nucleus and its downstream targets, to cause the changes characteristic of the disease. This raises challenging issues on the effects of cytokines on synaptic functions potentially involved in sleep-wakefulness alterations."
"Many patients with developmental disabilities exhibit various types of sleep disturbance. However, we have no idea of a specific approach to relieve the symptoms on sleep disturbance, although recent basic neuroscience has provided many novel findings on the neuronal mechanisms of the sleep-wakefulness cycle. In this brief review, a flip-flop circuit was introduced to explain neuronal mechanisms of the abrupt change between sleep and wakefulness. The rate of atonia during non-REM sleep was also introduced, as this index may useful for assessing the cholinoaminergic balance of the central nervous system. Sleep hygiene was also based on basic sleep-wakefulness mechanisms. To maintain sleep hygiene is a fundamental approach caring for patients with sleep disturbance, and specific approaches such as medication and treatment of sleep disordered breathing should also be based on the basic mechanisms of the sleep-wakefulness cycle. It was emphasized that effective intervention should only occur after the careful assessment of neuronal background of each patient."
"1. The actions of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and dihydroxyphenylserine (DOPS) were assessed on the sleep-wakefulness cycle of male Wistar rats. 2. In comparative studies the extracerebral decarboxylase was inhibited with serinetrihydroxybenzylhydrazide (RO 4-4602) before injection of DOPA or DOPS. 3. DOPA (80-160 mg/kg, i.p.) with or without previous inhibition of the peripheral decarboxylase gave rise to an initial significant increase of slow wave activity, which may be related to a release of 5-hydroxytryptamine. 4. During the subsequent 8 h sessions, DOPA significantly decreased slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep (REM) and increased wakefulness. 5. DOPS (80-160 mg/kg, i.p.) did not significantly modify the sleep-wakefulness cycle apart from a decrease of the latency for the first REM episode after 160 mg/kg in the RO 4-4602 pretreated animals."
"Prostaglandin (PG) s D2 and E2 are the major arachidonic acid metabolites in the mammalian brain. PGD synthase, the enzyme that produces PGD2 in the brain, is mainly localized in the arachnoid membrane and choroid plexus. It is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid and circulates in the brain through the ventricular system. PGD2 induces sleep by acting on the surface of the ventro-medial region of the rostral basal forebrain, the signal of which is probably transmitted into the brain parenchyma by adenosine via adenosine A2a receptors. Fos expression experiments suggest that PGD2 inhibits histaminergic arousal neurons of the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) in the posterior hypothalamus by activating inhibitory neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO). However, PGE2 causes wakefulness by activating arousal neurons in the TMN via AMPA type excitatory amino acid receptors. Therefore, PGD2, acting as a sleep-inducer, and PGE2, acting as a wakefulness-promoter, jointly regulate the generation of sleep and wakefulness in the mammalian brain."
"Effects of exposure to O3 on EEG activity, sleep-wakefulness and heart rate were examined using conscious rats which had been chronically implanted with electrodes for EEG, EMG and ECG recordings. Exposure to 0.5 ppm O3 for 6 hrs and 1.0 ppm O3 for 3 hrs suppressed amounts of wakefulness (W) and paradoxical sleep (PS) at the expense of an increase in slow-wave sleep (SWS), and lowered the amplitude of fast EEG waves and heart rate (HR). The lowered EEG amplitude and the suppressed PS recovered more rapidly during the post-exposure period than did the lowered HR. The ip administration of atropine sulfate blocked the suppressed W, the increased SWS and the lowered HR, while the lowered EEG amplitude and the suppressed PS were not blocked. These observations suggest that the O3-induced bradycardia results from enhanced activity of cardiac parasympathetic nerves and that the O3-induced changes in W and SWS result secondarily from some circulatory factor including the bradycardia."
"Cholinergic neurons in the pons appear to play a major role in generating rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In the present study, acetylcholine and glutamate release in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) during the sleep-waking cycle were investigated by in vivo microdialysis. Acetylcholine release during slow wave sleep (SWS) was significantly lower (P<0.05) than during REM sleep and wakefulness. On the other hand, glutamate release during wakefulness was higher (P<0.05) than during REM sleep and SWS. Furthermore, the application of N-methyl-D-aspartate (1 mM) induced a significant increase of nitric oxides (NOx) for 20 min (P<0.05) and a decrease of norepinephrine for the first 15 min (P=0.01), indicating NOx regulation on norepinephrine release in PPT."
"Maintenance of wakefulness is established to accomplish muscarinic (M-) cholinergic receptor activation in the ventrolateral preoptic area of the hypothalamus. The ""muscarinic"" wakefulness is characterized by enhancement of electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectra in the 0.75-12 Hz band and by increase in brain temperature. Activation of nicotinic (N-) cholinergic receptors of the area produces an increase in the duration of slow wave sleep, EEG power spectra reduction in the 0.75-7 Hz band, a decrease in brain temperature. And its hyperactivation leads to wakefulness, during its episodes the brain temperature decreases. During M- and N-cholinergic receptor blockade, the sleep-wakefulness and thermoregulation changes opposite to their activation were found. It is suggested that M- and N-cholinergic receptors of the ventrolateral preoptic area in pigeons participate in the sleep-wakefulness regulation and this effect is related to influence of this area on GABA-ergic system."
"Sleep-wakefulness and body temperature may modulate each other. Though both the functions are influenced by the medial preoptic area, the mechanism of action was not clear. This study was aimed at finding out whether the tonic influence of the medial preoptic area on sleep-wakefulness was independent of or secondary to simultaneous change in body temperature. The effects of inactivation of the area by a long acting local anaesthetic, marcain, on those physiological functions were investigated during the night and the day in freely moving rats. Though medial preoptic area influenced sleep-wakefulness and body temperature simultaneously, the effect on the latter was prolonged. The results suggest that the influence on sleep-wakefulness is unlikely to be associated with simultaneously changing body temperature. However, this study fails to differentiate whether the observed effects were due to inactivation of the cell body or the fibers passing through the area."
"The preoptic area is known to regulate sleep-wakefulness and body temperature. It was suggested earlier that though sleep-wakefulness and body temperature may affect each other, the preoptic area mediated influence on those two physiological phenomena is likely to be independent of alteration in each other. Since intrapreoptic area norepinephrine could modulate both those functions, study of that system was undertaken. It was hypothesized that since the preoptic area has different types of norepinephrinergic receptors (viz. alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta), independent modulation of those two functions was probably due to activation or inactivation of separate receptors. Hence, the effects of different agonist and antagonist of those receptors individually as well as in combination into the preoptic area were studied on those two functions in freely moving rats. The results suggest that norepinephrine induced preoptic area mediated influence on the body temperature is primarily regulated by the alpha 1 receptors while the sleep and wakefulness are regulated by alpha 2 and beta receptors, respectively. The finding should help in explaining several poorly understood observations reported earlier and it suggests that similar phenomena may possibly exist in other system involving other neurotransmitters as well."
"This work deals the comparative behavioral, somatosensor and neurophysiological characteristics of these forms of passive defensive behavior included in amphibian's sleep-wakefulness cycle and their developmental dynamics in the ascending vertebrates secale. Sleep formation in early postnatal ontogenesis of mature- and immature-born mammals - from undifferent sleep to the mature sleep divided into two phases as well as stress formation are considered in parallel. Comparative phylo-, and ontogenetic analysis of several aspects of stress-reactions, sleep, and immobility phenomenon of cataleptic type allows concluding that amphibians and reptilians catalepsy can be interpreted as preadaptive from of behavior underlying in the stress of homoeothermic animals. Another word, the cataleptic state can be considered as the homologic state of stress-reaction. Catalepsy is the genetically programmed state of poykilothermic animals characterized by comparatively high alertness of animal, its freezing in immobile but active posture with a possibility of fast exit into waking state and alongside with other somatosensor and neurophysiological characteristics determines the entire subsequent complex of evolutionary morphofunctional, neurophysiological and hormonal changes in nomoyptherms. This in many aspects unspecific behavioral adaptive reaction in poykilotherms is realized on the corresponding hormonal and neurophysiological levels of development and promotes to fast mobilization and stabilization their homeostasis. At the higher evolutionary scale after development of most brain neurotransmitter and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal systems the leading role in stress regulation begins to be predominent the hormonal reaction. Only in the alertness phase of stress-reaction the elements of activation of extrapyramidal regulatory system of locomotion are observed. This is manifested by the cateleptic immobility. Thus the stress as the general adaptational syndrome reflects the evolutionary regularities of development of specific functions supporting the total homeostasis. The scheme of evolution of sleep-wakefulness cycle in vertebrates is presented; according to it, the immobility state of cataleptic type on one hand may to considered as a part of wakefulness providing mainly specific elements of stress-reaction, while on other hand it is a certain step of inhibitory processes in CNS for subsequent involvement of sleep-regulatory systems for the compensation and maintenance of recovery reactions."
"The effects of ritanserin, a 5-hydroxytryptamine-2 (5-HT2) receptor antagonist, and chlordiazepoxide, a benzodiazepine agonist, on sleep-wakefulness disturbances in rats after acute administration of cocaine and after discontinuation of chronic cocaine treatment were examined. Intraperitoneal (IP) injection of chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg) but not ritanserin (0.63 mg/kg) prevented the increase of wakefulness (W) and the reduction of light slow wave sleep (SWS1) and deep slow wave sleep (SWS2) induced by an acute injection of cocaine (20 mg/kg IP). Daily injection of cocaine (20 mg/kg for 5 days, then 30 mg/kg for 5 days IP) at the onset of the light phase elicited an increase of W and a concomitant decrease of SWS1, SWS2 and paradoxical sleep (PS) in the light phase, followed by a rebound in SWS2 and PS in the subsequent dark phase. Following cocaine discontinuation, the circadian distribution of sleep-wakefulness states remained disturbed in saline-treated rats for at least 5 days. Both ritanserin (0.63 mg/kg IP/day) and chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg IP/day) reduced the alteration in the distribution of W and SWS2 throughout the light-dark cycle from the first day of administration on, but failed to prevent PS alterations. The mechanisms by which both compounds exert their effect are probably quite different. For chlordiazepoxide sedative and sleep-inducing properties probably play a major role. In contrast, for ritanserin SWS2-increasing properties and its ability to reverse preference for drugs of abuse without inducing aversion might be key factors."
"Psychosis in Parkinson's disease (PD) is common and associated with a range of negative outcomes. Dementia and psychosis are highly correlated in PD, but the frequency and correlates of psychosis in patients without cognitive impairment are not well understood. One hundred and ninety-one non-demented PD patients at two movement disorders centers participated in a study of neuropsychiatric complications in PD and completed a detailed neurological and neuropsychiatric assessment, including the rater-administered Parkinson Psychosis Rating Scale for hallucinations, delusions, and minor symptoms of psychosis (illusions and misidentification of persons). Psychotic symptoms were present in 21.5% of the sample. Visual hallucinations were most common (13.6%), followed by auditory hallucinations (6.8%), illusions or misidentification of people (7.3%), and paranoid ideation (4.7%). Visual hallucinations and illusions or misidentification of people were the most common comorbid symptoms (3.1%). Depression (P = 0.01) and rapid eye movement behavior disorder symptoms (P = 0.03) were associated with psychosis in a multivariable model. The odds of experiencing psychotic symptoms were approximately five times higher in patients with comorbid disorders of depression and sleep-wakefulness. Even in patients without global cognitive impairment, psychosis in PD is common and most highly correlated with other non-motor symptoms. Screening for psychosis should occur at all stages of PD as part of a broad non-motor assessment. In addition, these findings suggest a common neural substrate for disturbances of perception, mood, sleep-wakefulness, and incipient cognitive decline in PD."
"Investigations with dihydroergotoxine methane sulfonate (DHET, the active substance of Redergine) indicate that DHET acts on the sleep-wakefulness cycle of the cat by increasing wakefulness and slow-wave sleep and decreasing rapid eye movement sleep. DHET was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg for 5 successive days. The effects were fairly stable, although with a tendency to diminish with time. Such alterations in the sleep-wakefulness cycle are discussed as possible indices of the beneficial effects seen in elderly patients treated with DHET."
"Sleep-wakefulness and body temperature are two circadian rhythmic biological phenomena. The role of GABAergic inputs in the medial preoptico-anterior hypothalamus (mPOAH) on simultaneous regulation of those phenomena was investigated in freely moving normally behaving rats. The GABA-A receptors were blocked by microinjecting picrotoxin, and the effects on electrophysiological parameters signifying sleep-wakefulness, rectal temperature and brain temperature were recorded simultaneously. The results suggest that, normally, GABA in the medial preoptic area acts through GABA-A receptor that induces sleep and prevents an excessive rise in body temperature. However, the results do not allow us to comment on the cause and effect relationship, if any, between changes in sleep-wakefulness and body temperature. The changes in brain and rectal temperatures showed a positive correlation, however, the former varied within a narrower range than that of the latter."
"To elucidate a functional involvement of amino acids in the regulation of vigilance states, we investigated time-course changes of glycine (Gly), glutamate (Glu), and glutamine (Gln) in the extracellular fluid of the oral pontine reticular nucleus (PnO) in freely behaving rats by an in vivo microdialysis technique. The average concentration of Gly in dialysates collected during rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) was significantly higher than that collected during wakefulness (W) and non rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) under perfusion with normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). These state-dependent changes in Gly, however, failed to occur when the PnO was perfused with Ca2+-free aCSF. In contrast, the average concentration of neither Glu nor Gln exhibited state dependency under the perfusion with normal or Ca2+-free aCSF; however, the concentrations of all three amino acids showed no consistent time-sequential changes specifically in the first three minutes from the beginning of each vigilance state. Although it is suggested that in the PnO the average concentration of Gly was higher during REMS than during NREMS and W by a Ca2+-dependent mechanism, however, time-course changes in the amino acids are complicated and other mechanisms may also be influential."
"The various phases characterizing the sleep-wakefulness cycle were studied in rats. Electroencephalographic and electromyographic results were both analysed using classical visual methods and more sophisticated techniques such as spectral analysis and Hjorth parameters. The latter approach was very useful in obtaining a rapid characterization of regional and general brain activity and is applicable to the study of the EEG and EMG profiles of different pharmacological agents. Together with the conventional studies on the sleep-wakefulness cycle, the methodology reported here gives a powerful battery for the study of new centrally acting drugs."
"Although several roles of neuronal nitric oxide (NO) have been suggested, the capacity of NO on sleep-wakefulness mechanisms is open to discussion. We examined the effects of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors on rat sleep using a microdialysis technique. When NOS inhibitor L-NAME was administrated at the central region of diencephalon, paradoxical sleep (PS) significantly increased coinciding with decrease of wakefulness in the dose-dependent manner. The effect of L-NAME on PS was completely reversed by L-arginine. Additionally, administration of NO donor NOC 18 at the action site of L-NAME completely inhibited sleep. Our results suggest that NO could play a role in the continuation of vigilance around the midline thalamic nuclei."
"In order to examine the prosencephalic mechanisms that might sustain the effects of opiates on EEG and sleep-wakefulness, the actions of morphine sulfate on the EEG and the pupil size were examined in the chronically isolated forebrain of brainstem-transected cats. Single morphine doses (0.5, 2.0 or 3.0 mg/kg, i.p.) administered to these animals produced a long-lasting EEG desynchronization in the isolated forebrain which was associated with pupil mydriasis. The specificity of these morphine effects was shown by the fact that naloxone blocks both the EEG and pupillary effects of the drug. After morphine, spontaneous synchronized EEG with delta waves normally seen in the isolated forebrain preparation was suppressed for 6-18 h, followed by a strong rebound. Both the suppression and rebound in synchronization with delta waves occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The duration of these effects closely paralleled previously reported morphine effects on non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in intact cats. Therefore, in relation to the effects of morphine on EEG and sleep-wakefulness in intact animals, this study suggests that: (1) Morphine suppression of NREM sleep and the subsequent arousal state of the animal are mediated by prosencephalic structures; (2) the generation of the typical neocortical EEG slow burst activity produced by opiates depends on lower brainstem structures."
"Computer analysis and statistical processing of the unit activity showed that the majority of neurons (65.2%) in the gigantocellular tegmental field were discharging with high frequency during active wakefulness and paradoxical sleep as compared to slow-wave sleep in unrestrained rats. 11.6% of the neurons revealed an inverse pattern of activity: they discharged more intensively during slow-wave sleep, their firing rate decreasing during active wakefulness and paradoxical sleep. Some neurons (23.2%) were found which fired intensively during active wakefulness, their firing rate decreasing both in slow-wave and paradoxical sleep. Involvement of the gigantocellular tegmental field in the neurophysiological mechanisms of phases and stages of the sleep-wakefulness cycle is discussed."
"Rates of production as well as dry and evaporative heat loss during the sleep-wakefulness cycle were studied in 11 male, adult albino rats with chronically implanted electrodes and thermocouple re-entrant tubes. Two groups of animals chronically acclimated to 6 or 23 degrees C were acutely studied at 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C. Statistical analysis of the data shows that rates of heat production and dry heat loss differ with respect to acclimation and acute environmental temperatures, and show significant differences depending on the states of the sleep-wakefulness cycle. Rate of heat production was highest during wakefulness, intermediate during synchronized sleep and lowest during paradoxical sleep. Rate of dry heat loss of 15 degrees C was maximal during paradoxical sleep. Rate of evaporative heat loss apparently did not change with the states of the sleep-wakefulness cycle. Heat storage estimated from difference in rates of heat production and heat loss was positive during wakefulness, slightly negative during synchronized sleep and markedly negative during paradoxical sleep. The data presented suggest a clear although partial suppression of thermoregulatory mechanisms during paradoxical sleep in the white rat."
"In ovariectomized (OVX) Sprague-Dawley rats, estradiol benzoate (EB) has been reported to decrease rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep during the dark phase for up to 3 days. It is unknown, however, if estrogenic effects on sleep extend beyond 3 days or if other estrogens could induce the same changes. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the increased wakefulness in the dark phase was due to changes in active or quiet wakefulness. Therefore, we examined the effects of daily injections of 17alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE) for 6 days on sleep and wakefulness in the OVX rat. After 3 days of baseline recording using a telemetric system, rats were administered sesame oil (sc) for 3 days followed by injection with EE (20 mug/rat/day, sc) for 6 days. After treatment, sleep was recorded during hormone withdrawal for an additional 5 days. A few sporadic but statistically significant increases in light phase sleep occurred during the last 3 days of EE treatment. Starting on day 2 of the study, EE caused statistically significant decreases in dark phase REM sleep that were maintained throughout the treatment period and persisted until the 3rd day of hormone withdrawal. During the dark phase, statistically significant decreases in NREM sleep and increases in active wakefulness started on the second day of treatment and abated by the end of treatment. This study demonstrated that EE had similar effects on sleep-wakefulness to EB and demonstrates the utility of telemetric polysomnographic recording of the female OVX rat as a model for understanding the estrogen-induced changes on sleep-wakefulness."
"The review discusses various mechanisms of the rapidly growing problem of Sleep Medicine. The ""Sleep-wakefulness"" cycle is a continuum of different functional states and the diseases that these states might prompt to manifest themselves in various ways. In these cases, we must say that change produces the conditions of disease manifestation rather than the disease itself. The paper describes the dynamics of the autonomous parameters during sleep, emphasizes the role and importance of chronobiological aspects of the ""sleep-wakefulness"" cycle. The holographic principle of the operation I sleep cycle is described which persists even in the cerebral stroke. From the standpoint of neurochemistry, modern hypnotics and drugs of the nearest future can be divided into 2 groups: proS (pro sleep)--for sleeping, and antiW (anti-wakefulness)--vs. wakefulness."
"We investigated extracellular 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in rat hippocampus during different stages of the sleep-waking cycle using in vivo microdialysis. The extracellular 5-HT level was highest in active waking (AW) and, when compared to AW, 5-HT level was progressively lower in quiet waking (QW; 78%), quiet sleep (QS; 50%) and REM (which we termed active sleep (AS); 40%). Functional implications of AS related-decreased 5-HT in the hippocampus are discussed."
"Histaminergic neurons within the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) play an important role in sleep-wakefulness regulation. Here, we report the muscarinic modulation of GABAergic spontaneous miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in mechanically dissociated rat histaminergic neurons using a conventional whole-cell patch clamp technique. Muscarine, a nonselective muscarinic acetylcholine (mACh) receptor agonist, reversibly decreased mIPSC frequency without affecting the current amplitude, indicating that muscarine acts presynaptically to decrease the probability of spontaneous GABA release. The muscarine action on GABAergic mIPSC frequency was completely blocked by atropine, a nonselective mACh receptor antagonist, and tropicamide, an M(4) receptor antagonist. The muscarine-induced decrease in mIPSC frequency was completely occluded in the presence of Cd(2+), a general voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel blocker, or in a Ca(2+)-free external solution. However, pharmacological agents affecting adenylyl cyclase or G-protein coupled inwardly rectifying K(+) channel activity did not prevent the inhibitory action of muscarine on GABAergic mIPSCs. These results suggest that muscarine acts on M(4) receptors on GABAergic nerve terminals projecting to histaminergic neurons to inhibit spontaneous GABA release via the inhibition of Ca(2+) influx from the extracellular space. Muscarine also inhibited action potential-dependent GABA release by activating presynaptic M(4) receptors in more physiological conditions. The M(4) receptor-mediated modulation of GABAergic transmission onto TMN neurons may contribute to the regulation of sleep-wakefulness."
"Sleep-wakefulness patterns in dogs were studied using computerized on-line analysis and off-line sleep stage classification. A short description of the methods is given and the results of the analysis are discussed, touching on the problem of similarities and dissimilarities with sleep-wakefulness patterns in cats. Examples are given of species differences with respect to the effects of narcotic analgesics. The predictability of results obtained in the dog with respect to humans is discussed using as an example the sedative effects of antihistamines and the absence of such effects in response to a specific H1-antagonist, astemizole. The role of neurotransmitters in sleep is studied, especially the role of dopamine by using dopamine antagonists (pimozide, domperidone) and dopamine agonists (apomorphine)."
"Fluctuations in sleep-wake state are thought to contribute to the respiratory instability of Cheyne-Stokes respiration in patients with heart failure by promoting the rhythmic occurrence of central apnea and ventilatory overshoot. There are no data, however, on the relationship between vigilance state and respiratory events. In this study we used a novel method to detect the occurrence of state transitions (time resolution: 0.25 s, minimum duration of state changes: 2 s) and to assess their time relationship with apnoeic events. We also evaluated whether end-apnoeic arousals are associated with a ventilatory overshoot. A polysomnographic, daytime laboratory recording (25 min) was performed during Cheyne-Stokes respiration in 16 patients with heart failure. Automatic state classification included wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement sleep stages 1-2. As a rule, wakefulness occurred during hyperpnoeic phases, and non-rapid eye movement sleep occurred during apnoeic events. Ninety-two percent of the observed central apneas (N = 272) were associated with a concurrent wakefulness --> non-rapid eye movement sleep --> wakefulness transition. The delay between wakefulness --> non-rapid eye movement sleep transitions and apnea onset was -0.3 [-3.1, 3.0] s [median (lower quartile, upper quartile); P = 0.99 testing the null hypothesis: median delay = 0], and the delay between non-rapid eye movement sleep --> wakefulness transitions and apnea termination was 0.2 [-0.5, 1.2] s (P = 0.7). A positive/negative delay indicates that the state transition occurred before/after the onset or termination of apnea. Non-rapid eye movement sleep --> wakefulness transitions synchronous with apnea termination were associated with a threefold increase in tidal volume and a twofold increase in ventilation (all P < 0.001), indicating ventilatory overshoot. These findings highlight that wakefulness --> non-rapid eye movement sleep --> wakefulness transitions parallel apnoeic events during Cheyne-Stokes respiration in patients with heart failure. The relationships between state changes and respiratory events are consistent with the notion that state fluctuations promote ventilatory instability."
"The present paper deals with relationships between neural systems which control motor behaviour (pyramidal and extrapyramidal) and sleep-wakefulness states (in particular the reticular formation). We examined successively their anatomical and neurochemical substrates, electrophysiological and functional motor alterations depending on ascending and descending influences from brain stem during the sleep-wakefulness cycle. These data suggest that sleep-wake states result from the modulation of excitability in neuronal pools and that each state results from the co-ordinated working of several functionally different neuronal pools. Thus, each state could be understood as a sum of behavioural events depending on a neural network. We hypothesized that abnormal motor events occurring specifically during a sleep state could result from motor structures abnormally recruited in neural networks specifically involved in this sleep state."
"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Serotonergic (5HT) neurons of the dorsal raphe nuclei receive excitatory input from hypothalamic orexin (hypocretin) neurons and reciprocally inhibit orexin neurons through the 5HT1A receptor. However, the physiological significance of this negative feedback circuit for sleep/wakefulness regulation is little understood. DESIGN: 5HT1A receptor expression level was specifically and reversibly controlled in the orexin neurons using the Tet-off system. The responsiveness of orexin neurons to 5HT in vitro and the sleep/wakefulness patterns were compared between 5HT1A-overexpressing and control mice. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: When the 5HT1A receptor was overexpressed in orexin neurons of Orexin-EGFP; orexin-tTA; TetO Htr1a mice, 5HT-induced inhibition of orexin neurons was prolonged. In the absence of doxycycline, Orexin-tTA; TetO Htr1a mice exhibited severe fragmentation of sleep/wakefulness during the first half of the dark period-the time of maximal activity in nocturnal rodents-without affecting sleep/wakefulness during the light period when sleep time is maximal. However, when the 5HT1A receptor in orexin neurons was reduced to basal expression levels in the presence of doxycycline, sleep/wakefulness patterns in Orexin-tTA; TetO Htr1a mice during the early active period were indistinguishable from those of littermate TetO Htr1a mice. These results strongly suggest that enhancement of inhibitory serotonergic input to orexin neurons caused fragmentation of wakefulness. In contrast, sleep/wakefulness architecture in the light period was unaffected by 5HT1A receptor overexpression in the orexin neurons. CONCLUSION: Inhibitory serotonergic input likely functions as negative feedback to orexin neurons in the early dark period and helps stabilize wakefulness bouts, thereby contributing to the diurnal rhythm of sleep and wakefulness."
"The discovery that various states of sleep, rest, wakefulness and arousal in man can be correlated with specific forms of the electroencephalogram1 has led to intensive studies of these states, mostly in mammals2-5. Today it is generally accepted that circadian sleep-wakefulness cycles occur in mammals and birds2,3,6. Behavioural observations on sleep in moths have also been published7; many other invertebrates demonstrate rest/activity cycles8. Circadian sensitivity fluctuations in both central9 and peripheral10-15 components of the visual system of various nocturnal arthropod species have been demonstrated. We now report that long-term, extracellular, single-unit recordings from optomotor interneurones in the optic lobes of forager honey bees reveal an oscillation in their sensitivity to moving visual stimuli16, 17. The oscillation displays properties typical of a circadian rhythm6, 18. The sensitivity of the neurons is higher during the subjective day than during the subjective night. The locomotor activity of individual, fixed walking forager bees shows a similar circadian oscillation and is also higher during the subjective day. Visual and mechanical stimuli can act directly on the interneurones and restore their sensitivity during times of reduced neuronal responsiveness. A comparison with results available for mammals makes it likely that the neuronal phenomena presented here are correlates of the bee's circadian sleep-wakefulness rhythm."
"Neuronal activity was investigated by extracellular microelectrodes in the pallidal region of freely moving cats during wakefulness (W), slow-wave sleep (SWS) and paradoxical sleep (PS). The firing of 150 units from 35 points was examined. On the basis of the modifications of firing rates and patterns during the sleep-wakefulness cycle, 5 groups of neurons were distinguished. Two of these groups were characterized by strong increase of firing rate in W and PS and in one of them this increase preceded the cortical activation at the SWS-PS transition by an average of 26 sec. The role played by the basal forebrain area in the regulation of the sleep-wakefulness cycle is discussed."
"Experiments were performed on 31 male SD rats. The results were as follows: (1) The time of waking was increased during the second and third hours after microinjection of 3.3 and 6.6 nmol bromocriptine into bilateral VTA (P < 0.01), but the 1.33 nmol group was without significant effect. (2) The time of waking was decreased during the second and third hours after microinjection of 2 and 4 nmol SCH23390 into VTA (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 respectively), while 3.4 nmol sulpiride group was without effect. (3) One week after administration of kainic acid (0.3 microgram), the rats presented less time of waking in the day (P < 0.05), while sleep-wakefulness cycle at night showed no change. The results suggest that bromocriptine could increase wakefulness by activating VTA DA neurons via D1 receptor and that the DA neurons might exert a tonic effect for maintaining the wakefulness at the daytime."
"This study examines the influence of lesions in the centralis superior raphe nucleus (CeSR) and adjacent paramedial pontine tegmentum on the sleep/wakefulness cycle (SWC) in cats. Sixteen cats had electrodes implanted for electro-oculogram (EOG), electromyogram (EMG), electroencephalogram (EEG) and ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) recordings. There were 10 experimental animals: seven animals received diathermocoagulation lesions destroying between 7 and 27% of the CeSR; the remaining three cats suffered bilateral lesions in the paramedial portion of the reticularis pontis oralis (RPO) and caudalis (RPC) nuclei. Six sham-operated animals were used as controls. Recordings were taken of all animals in continuous 23-h sessions once a week for 12 weeks. Results indicated that the threshold for SWC state changes (increase of wakefulness (W) and drowsiness (D), and decrease of slow wave sleep (SWS)) after CeSR lesion is approximately 11.3% following volumetric destruction of the nucleus. The amount of CeSR damage (CeSR-D) only correlated significantly with the amount of W (positive correlation) and SWS (negative correlation) during the first week post-lesion. The changes in W over the course of the study were different in the two experimental groups. In both groups, total W was increased with respect to the controls, however, these increases were observed earlier in the CeSR-D group. The return to near control values in SWC state over days 15-28 of the study does not represent a definitive recovery by the CeSR-D cats. All the SWC states returned to control values by the tenth week in the cats with paramedial reticular pontine damage."
"Effects of estradiol on the sleep-wakefulness circadian rhythm were studied in ovariectomized female rats under a 12: 12 light-dark schedule. In rats that were subcutaneously injected with 20 micrograms of estradiol benzoate (EB) or that had crystalline EB implanted into the third ventricle (III V), the total time of slow wave sleep (SWS) and paradoxical sleep (PS) in the night time was significantly decreased on the third day after the EB administration. The suppression of PS was more remarkable than that of SWS. Slight increases were observed in the total time of SWS and PS in the day time. These effects of estrogen on the appearance patterns of SWS and PS in the night and day time could be elicited in spayed rats after crystalline EB was implanted into the medial preoptic area (MPO) or the medial amygdala (mAMYG), but the implant into the latter proved less effective. Cholesterol implants into IIIV, MPO or mAMYG produced no change in the sleep-wakefulness circadian pattern. Implantations of crystalline EB into the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus or the dorsomedial thalamic nucleus were ineffective. These results indicate that MPO is probably the most effective site of estrogen on the sleep-wakefulness circadian rhythm of female rats."
"We previously reported the effect of vagus nerve electrical stimulation (VNS) on sleep and behavior in cats. The aim of the present study is to analyze the long-term effects of VNS on the electroencephalographic (EEG) power spectrum and on the different stages of the sleep-wakefulness cycle in the freely moving cat. To achieve this, six male cats were implanted with electrodes on the left vagal nerve and submitted to 15 rounds of 23 h continuous sleep recordings in three categories: baseline (BL), VNS and post-stimulus recording (PSR). The following parameters were analyzed: EEG power spectrum, total time and number of sleep phases, ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) wave density of the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and the number of times the narcoleptic reflex was present (sudden transition from wakefulness to REM sleep). Significant changes were detected, such as an enhancement of slow-wave sleep (SWS) stage II; a power increase in the bands corresponding to sleep spindles (8-14 Hz) and delta waves (1-4 Hz) with VNS and PSR; an increase in the total time, number of stages, and density of PGO wave in REM sleep with VNS; a decrease of wakefulness in PSR, and the eventual appearance of the narcoleptic reflex with VNS. The results show that the effect of the VNS changes during different stages of the sleep-wakefulness cycle. In REM sleep, the effect was present only during VNS, while the SWS II was affected beyond VNS periods. This suggests that ponto-medullar and thalamic mechanisms of slow EEG activity may be due to plastic changes elicited by vagal stimulation."
"Changes in the levels of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) in the discrete regions of rat brain during the sleep-wakefulness cycle were studied using a microwave fixation method. Rats were restrained in a specially designed frame in which they could move their heads and extremities freely and take food and water ad libitum. The rats were acclimatized to the microwave applicator for 1 h a day for 5-7 days, and then they were sacrificed by microwave irradiation of the heads under polygraphic monitoring. This procedure made it possible to obtain tissue for the analysis of cyclic nucleotides at different times during the sleep-wakefulness cycle. The content of cAMP in the various regions of the brain except the cerebellum decreased during sleep. In the hippocampus, midbrain, pons-medulla and cerebellum, the level of cGMP was highest during wakefulness, whereas in the striatum it was highest during paradoxical sleep. In the midbrain and pons-medulla, the level of cGMP was higher during paradoxical sleep than during slow-wave sleep. These changes of cyclic nucleotide contents may reflect the changes in the release of putative neurotransmitters during the sleep-wakefulness cycle. Our findings suggest that cyclic nucleotides may play some roles in the regulation of the sleep-wakefulness cycle."
"Of the many health-related effects of shift work, disturbed sleep is the most common. This review describes the main observed effects of the three principal shifts (night, morning and afternoon) on patterns of sleep and wakefulness. The mechanism of sleep disruption in relation to circadian rhythms and the specific impact of aspects of shift organization (speed and direction of rotation) are discussed. The most troublesome acute symptoms are difficulty getting to sleep, shortened sleep and somnolence during working hours that continues into successive days off. These are only partially amenable to amelioration by manipulating shift patterns. However, there is no clear indication that chronic sleep problems result from long-term shift work."
"Sleep-wakefulness patterns were analyzed during a 15-day period in the rat, in relation to induction of helplessness. After a session of inescapable electric footshocks, rats did exhibit escape deficits in avoidance conditioning as classically described, and their spontaneous sleep-wakefulness patterns were not different from those of controls. However, reduced PS latency and increased PS amounts were observed in the helpless group after shuttle-box sessions, especially during the initial period after the induction of helplessness. Such modifications of PS latency and PS amounts are evocative of the sleep impairments classically observed in endogenous depression."
"Adrenergic alpha 2 agonist (clonidine) and its antagonist (yohimbine) were locally applied to the medial preoptic area (mPOA), to find out the role of alpha 2 receptors at this brain region in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness. Clonidine produced arousal, whereas yohimbine induced sleep in freely moving animals. Behavioural arousal produced by clonidine administration was accompanied by EEG synchronization. The alpha 2 receptor as the probable site of action of externally applied norepinephrine (NE), is discussed."
"Study Objectives: In humans and other mammals, sleep is altered during pregnancy. However, no studies have been conducted on sleep/wakefulness during pregnancy in mice. In this study, we examined sleep/wakefulness in female C57BL/6 mice during pregnancy. We also examined sleep/wake behaviors in an animal model of preeclampsia, pregnancy-associated hypertensive (PAH) mice, in which increased angiotensin causes hypertension. Methods: Sleep/wake behaviors of female C57BL/6 and PAH mice were examined based on electroencephalogram (EEG) or electromyogram recordings before, during, and after pregnancy. To examine whether high blood pressure disrupts the integrity of the blood-brain barrier in PAH mice, Evans blue dye was injected intravenously. Angiotensin II receptor blocker (olmesartan)-administered PAH mice and female Tsukuba hypertensive mice were also examined. Results: C57BL/6 mice showed a decreased total wake time and increased nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep time during late pregnancy. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time did not change during the course of pregnancy. PAH mice exhibited a general slowing of EEG during late pregnancy and subsequently returned to apparently normal sleep/wakefulness after delivery. All PAH mice exhibited multiple focal leakages of Evans blue dye in the brain. Spike-and-wave discharges were observed in 50% of PAH mice. Olmesartan-administered PAH mice did not show general slowing of EEG. Tsukuba hypertensive mice showed a normal time spent in wakefulness and NREM sleep and a decreased total REM sleep time. Conclusions: This study showed pregnant-stage-specific changes in sleep/wakefulness in C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, PAH mice may be useful as an animal model for eclampsia."
"The aim of the present study was to find out the changes in sleep-wakefulness and body temperature brought about by application of cholinergic agonist, carbachol, in the medial preoptic area (mPOA). Carbachol, when injected bilaterally into the mPOA of male rats, through chronically implanted cannulae, produced a fall in rectal temperature and long lasting arousal. There was temporal dissociation in the duration of changes produced in the two parameters. It is suggested that the cholinergic system at the medial preoptic area brings about arousal response and fall in body temperature through different circuits."
"The preoptic area is anatomically divided into medial and lateral portions and both are involved in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness and body temperature. We have recently reported the specific role of the adrenoceptors, present in the medial preoptic area, in the regulation of those functions. In this study an attempt was made to investigate the specific participation and contribution of the lateral preoptic area alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness and body temperature. Sleep-wakefulness and rectal temperature were simultaneously recorded in freely moving rats, both during day and night, under normal condition and after bilateral local microinjection of either agonist or antagonist of alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors into the lateral preoptic area. The results suggest that the lateral preoptic area alpha-2 adrenoceptors are predominantly involved in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness whereas alpha-1 adrenoceptors are more effective in thermoregulation."
"Affective experiences are central not only to our waking life but also to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep dreams. Despite our increasing understanding of the neural correlates of dreaming, we know little about the neural correlates of dream affect. Frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) is considered a marker of affective states and traits as well as affect regulation in the waking state. Here, we explored whether FAA during REM sleep and during evening resting wakefulness is related to affective experiences in REM sleep dreams. EEG recordings were obtained from 17 human participants (7 men) who spent 2 nights in the sleep laboratory. Participants were awakened 5 min after the onset of every REM stage after which they provided a dream report and rated their dream affect. Two-minute preawakening EEG segments were analyzed. Additionally, 8 min of evening presleep and morning postsleep EEG were recorded during resting wakefulness. Mean spectral power in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) and corresponding FAA were calculated over the frontal (F4-F3) sites. Results showed that FAA during REM sleep, and during evening resting wakefulness, predicted ratings of dream anger. This suggests that individuals with greater alpha power in the right frontal hemisphere may be less able to regulate (i.e., inhibit) strong affective states, such as anger, in dreams. Additionally, FAA was positively correlated across wakefulness and REM sleep. Together, these findings imply that FAA may serve as a neural correlate of affect regulation not only in the waking but also in the dreaming state.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We experience emotions not only during wakefulness but also during dreaming. Despite our increasing understanding of the neural correlates of dreaming, we know little about the neural correlates of dream emotions. Here we used electroencephalography to explore how frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA)-the relative difference in alpha power between the right and left frontal cortical areas that is associated with emotional processing and emotion regulation in wakefulness-is related to dream emotions. We show that individuals with greater FAA (i.e., greater right-sided alpha power) during rapid eye movement sleep, and during evening wakefulness, experience more anger in dreams. FAA may thus reflect the ability to regulate emotions not only in the waking but also in the dreaming state."
"The study investigated the possible interrelationship between changes in sleep-wakefulness and body temperature, primarily induced by manipulation of the noradrenergic system in the medial preoptic area. Saline, norepinephrine, and its alpha- and beta-blockers were injected in the medial preoptic area and in some control areas of rats, during their sleeping and active periods. 5-Hydroxytryptamine was injected in the medial preoptic area in another group of animals. Simultaneous changes in sleep-wakefulness and the body temperature were continuously recorded. Norepinephrine produced hypothermia and arousal, whereas alpha-adrenergic blockers induced hyperthermia and sleep. These changes in body temperature and in sleep-wakefulness did not follow an identical time course. 5-Hydroxytryptamine induced hyperthermia without affecting sleep-wakefulness. It is suggested that there are different neuronal mechanisms in the medial preoptic area that bring about the drug-induced changes in temperature and sleep-wakefulness."
"It has been described that an acute immobilization stress (IS) modifies subsequent paradoxical sleep (PS). However, its effects are complex because some subjects remain unaffected. This discrepancy might result from constitutive inter-individual psychobiological differences. In order to test this hypothesis, an inter-individual analysis of sleep patterns and their modifications after 60 min IS has been performed. Even though global analysis showed a PS increase after IS, inter-individual analysis evidenced different PS reactivity; subjects which had the least PS during control recordings were those with the largest PS increase. Unlike global analysis, an inter-individual study evidenced different modifications of wakefulness and slow wave sleep according to individuals. Subjects presenting the highest amount of wakefulness in control conditions (the lowest amount of slow wave sleep) decreased their wakefulness amount, while subjects with the lowest amount of wakefulness increased it. Thus, individual characteristics of the sleep-wakefulness cycle should be considered while studying its modifications induced by different treatments."
"Circadian rhythms were examined in a congenitally anophthalmic rat mutant. All bilaterally anophthalmic rats had clear circadian rhythms in sleep-wakefulness as well as in locomotor activity, but the rhythms did not entrain to the light-dark (LD) cycle. However, two unilaterally anophthalmic rats, like sighted rats, reentrained their sleep-wakefulness rhythms to the LD cycle in 4 days after a 6 hr delaying phase-shift. The hypogenesis of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) that is correlated with absence of circadian activity rhythms in anophthalmic mice was not observed in these anophthalmic rats."
"A quantitative study was carried out on the sleep-wakefulness cycle by means of EEG recordings taken simultaneously from a dog's implanted head and its host. During survival (108 h), neurological activities of the implanted head were similar to those of classic 'encephale isole' preparations. In spite of a common circulation, the sleep-wakefulness cycles of the implanted head and host animal were independent. Independence was manifested by: (1) differing percentages of respective phases of their cycles; (2) periods of coincident phases in both heads, only occasionally beginning and/or stopping simultaneously; and (3) the implanted 'encephale isole' showed a monotonous cycle with numerous periods of short duration throughout night or day. The host presented a nycthemeral rhythm."
"The temporal patterns of the sleep-wakefulness cycle and growth hormone secretion throughout a day in the male and female rat were studied in male and rats at 27 approximately 31 days of age. EEGs were recorded continuously from 27 to 31 days of age, and a time series of the amount of sleep for every 10 min was obtained. Serial blood sampling through an intracardiac cannula at 10-min intervals was performed for each of the 6-h periods beginning at 12:00, 18:00, 00:00 and 06:00 h. By analysis of the power spectrum and the least squares method, the time series was found to have approximately a 3.0-h periodicity in any of the 6-h periods and in either sex. The peak time which was estimated for the time series of GH concentrations was found to occur consistently around 02:00 approximately 03:00, 05:00 approximately 06:00, 08:00 approximately 09:00, 11:00 approximately 12:00, 14:00 approximately 15:00, 17:00 approximately 18:00, 20:00 approximately 21:00 and 23:00 approximately 24:00 h in either the male or the female rat. The time series of the amount of sleep over a 24-h period at 29 days of age revealed an ultradian rhythm with approximately a 3.0-h periodicity, and the peak time was estimated to be the same as that for the GH time series Taking the findings that the GH secretion is related to sleep in the prepubertal rat as described in the accompanying paper (Tsai, 1983), it could be speculated that the rat GH secretory rhythm develops by 30 days of age as a 3.0-h period ultradian rhythm that entrains to the time of day, relating to the rhythm of the sleep-wakefulness cycle."
"Fetal rapid eye movements (REM), breathing movements (BM), and trunk movements (TM) were observed through the use of 3 ultrasonic real-time scanners. Each movement was recorded with the event marker and quantitatively analyzed in relation to the development of the sleep-wakefulness cycle by a computer-assisted system. The results were as follows: The number of REM increased with gestational age. The appearance rate of REM reached a certain level after 32 weeks of gestation. REM-non-REM rhythm was distinguished after 32 weeks. The relationship between REM and BM increased with gestational age. The occurrence of each TM has no correlation to that of REM when it was analyzed in short-term units, but the incidence of TM was high in REM periods. These results demonstrate the course of the development of sleep-wakefulness cycle in human fetuses."
"We reported an 11-year-old boy who suffered from transient hypernatremia, hypothermia, and circadian rhythm disturbances of sleep-wakefulness and body temperature from the age of 4 years, as sequelae of acute subdural hematoma. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed low intensity consistent with necrotic change in the whole left cerebral hemisphere, hypothalamic region, and the right-sided brain stem including tegmentum, while the pituitary structure was well preserved. Anterior pituitary function was almost normal. ADH (antidiuretic hormone) was neither stimulated by hyperosmolality nor suppressed by hyposmolality but continued to be secreted at almost constant level approximating the normal basal state. This pattern seemed to be due to complete destruction of the osmoreceptor located in the anterior hypothalamus. He exhibited a dispersed-type sleep with differentiated stages of NREM (non-rapid eye movement), although the percentage of sleep was higher at night than in the daytime. It is suggested that circadian rhythm of sleep-wakefulness and differentiation of NREM sleep stages are regulated by different neuromechanisms. Brain stem lesion on MRI may be connected with the pathogenesis of the dispersed-type sleep with special respect to amplitude reduction of sleep-waking circadian rhythm. Circadian rhythm of body temperature (BT) was irregular in amplitude, phase, and period without synchronization with sleep-wakefulness rhythm. Hypothermia was also demonstrated at the basal state, while BT increased when he suffered from respiratory infection. It is likely that hypothermia in our case is caused by the BT shift to the lower side due to malfunction of BT integrating system including preoptic area and anterior hypothalamus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The temporal correlation of the secretion of corticosterone (CS) and growth hormone (GH) with the sleep-wakefulness cycle in adult male rats was studied by serial blood sampling at 10-min intervals over a 11-hour period from 11.00 to 22.00 h. Cortical EEGs recorded continuously during the blood sampling were scored into wakefulness and sleep, and the amounts of sleep for every 10 min was plotted against the CS and GH values. All 11-hour time series of CS, GH and amount of sleep were found to have three major ultradian rhythms with periodicities of 1.5 h and its multiples. For CS, there was a significantly negative cross-correlation between the amounts of sleep. Although the most prominent CS rhythm was the 1.5-hour period, CS secretion occurring with a 3.0-hour period had such a phase relationship with the 3.0-hour period sleep rhythm that the secretion began in the late stage of sleep cycle and reached its peak around the time of wakefulness between sleep cycles. In contrast, a GH secretory burst occurred in the early stage of the sleep cycle occurring with a 3.0-hour period, with a definite time lag after the onset of the sleep cycle. The present study demonstrates that three different functions, CS, GH secretions and sleep-wakefulness, have common ultradian rhythms with similar periods, and manifest their rhythms based on their own pacemakers. It is assumed further that each pacemaker is fixed in specific phase relations with others."
"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that the region of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NST) is involved in the control of electrocortical activity and in sleep mechanisms. It also is well known that this region contains the highest concentration of opioid receptors within the medullary brainstem. The involvement of the NST opioid system in sleep-wakefulness states were evaluated. METHODS: Ten cats were implanted with electrodes for chronic polygraphic recordings of their sleep-wakefulness states and provided with an implanted guide cannula stereotaxically aimed at the NST region. Microinjections of saline, morphine sulfate, morphiceptin (specific mu agonist), D-pen-2-D-pen-5-enkephalin (delta agonist), and U-50488H (kappa agonist) were given to the freely moving animals (doses 0.8-2.4 x 10(-9) M, in a volume of 0.05 microliters of saline). After microinjections, sleep-wakefulness recordings were obtained for 8 h. RESULTS: Morphine microinjections in NST provoked a dose-dependent enhancement of all the polygraphic and behavioral manifestations of slow wave sleep. This effect was blocked by the prior intraperitoneal administration of naloxone. The mu and delta agonists also produced a hypnotic effect by enhancing slow wave sleep. By contrast, the kappa agonist caused no changes in sleep-wakefulness states. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that endogenous opioids could be involved in controlling electrocortical activity generated by NST and that activation of mu and delta NST opioid receptors enhanced the electroencephalographic synchronization associated with behavioral slow wave sleep in cats."
"To determine quantitatively characteristics of sleep-wakefulness rhythms in male albino rats, computer analysis of long term polygraphic records (24 h/day) of cortical EEG activity, neck EMG and EOG taken from 23 rats under 12:12 light-dark schedule was performed. After bilateral suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) lesions, the circadian rhythm in sleep-wakefulness was completely eliminated, although no attenuation or even slight enhancement of the ultradian rhythms with 2-4 h pweiodicity was observed. After enucleation of both eyes, the circadian rhythm was free-running with a phase shift in the range from --12 to +22 min/day in 6 rats. A gradual decrease of the spectral value of the circadian rhythm and inverse enhancement of the ultradian rhythms with 4--7 h periodicity (predominantly 6 h in 4 out of 6 rats) were also shown. In the spectral diagram, the appearance of paradoxical sleep (PS) paralleled slow-wave sleep (SWS), in the cases of the circadian rhythm and ultradian rhythms with 4--7 h periodicity. Behaviorally blind rats with bilateral primary optic tract (POT) lesions maintained the circadian rhythm in sleep-wakefulness entrained to the environmental light-dark cycle. Power spectral analysis showed no characteristic difference from normal rats. Based on these data, the role of the SCN as a pacemaker of endogenous circadian rhythm in sleep-wakefulness is discussed."
"OBJECTIVE: Noninvasive ventilation with pressure support (NIV-PS) therapy can augment ventilation; however, such therapy is fixed and may not adapt to varied patient needs. We tested the hypothesis that in patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency, a newer mode of ventilation [averaged volume assured pressure support (AVAPS)] and lateral decubitus position were associated with better sleep efficiency than NIV-PS and supine position. Our secondary aim was to assess the effect of mode of ventilation, body position, and sleep-wakefulness state on minute ventilation (V(E)) in the same patients. DESIGN: Single-blind, randomized, cross-over, prospective study. SETTING: Academic institution. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight patients. INTERVENTIONS: NIV-PS or AVAPS therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Three sleep studies were performed in each patient; prescription validation night, AVAPS or NIV-PS, and crossover to alternate mode. Sleep was not different between AVAPS and NIV-PS. Supine body position was associated with worse sleep efficiency than lateral decubitus position (77.9 +/- 22.9 and 85.2 +/- 10.5%; P = 0.04). V(E) was lower during stage 2 NREM and REM sleep than during wakefulness (P < 0.0001); was lower during NIV-PS than AVAPS (P = 0.029); tended to be lower with greater body mass index (P = 0.07), but was not influenced by body position. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency, supine position was associated with worse sleep efficiency than the lateral decubitus position. AVAPS was comparable to NIV-PS therapy with regard to sleep, but statistically greater V(E) during AVAPS than NIV-PS of unclear significance was observed. V(E) was determined by sleep-wakefulness state, body mass index, and mode of therapy."
"To study the effect of a four-day-round trip flight on the sleep-wakefulness of airline flight attendants, subjective sleep-wakefulness and autonomic sleep phases were measured. Forty flight attendants (mean age 33 years, range 21-50) kept daily logs on sleepiness, the time when going to bed, and sleep quality. In addition, the autonomic sleep phases of 21 subjects were studied by the static charge sensitive bed (SCSB) method. After the westward flight, the subjects went to bed approximately 1-3 h local time earlier during the first few days and were very sleepy compared to the week before the flight. There was a significant increase in the number of awakenings and in the feeling of 'not being at all rested' in the mornings. After the return flight eastwards, the subjects were very sleepy on the first evening but slept rather well for about 11 h. During the three following days, sleep restlessness, difficulties in falling asleep, and the feelings of sleepiness in the mornings increased compared to the week before the flights. Four days after the return flight, sleep length and the quality of sleep were, on average, the same as before the flights. According to the SCSB method, there were only small changes in the autonomic sleep phases due to the flights. After the westward flight, quiet sleep increased and intermediate sleep decreased compared to the sleep before the flight. The results indicate that most flight attendants have significant disturbances in sleep quality after transmedian flights. Sleep disturbances increase after both westward and eastward transmedian flights, but differ from each other in specific features."
"OBJECTIVE: Between November 2002 and March 2003, the authors assessed the prevalence and correlates of napping among Spanish university students. PARTICIPANTS: The sample comprised 1,276 first-year university students; the mean age was 18.74 +/- 1.24 years, and 35.45% were men. METHODS: The study was cross-sectional, and the students completed self-report, anonymous questionnaires provided during an in-class survey. RESULTS: Almost half (44%) of the sample reported napping (90% did so after lunch for longer than 1 hour). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that experiencing an irregular sleep-wakefulness pattern, having a morning school schedule, and being male were significant predictor variables of napping. Further significant outcome variables related to napping were having excessive daytime sleepiness, missing classes because of tiredness, better ability to concentrate later in the afternoon, and a perception of deeper nighttime sleep. CONCLUSIONS: Habitual napping is common among Spanish university students and associated with an irregular sleep-wakefulness pattern. Taking long postlunch naps seems to be used by students to cope with insufficient sleep and daytime sleepiness."
"The timing of the internal circadian clock shows large inter-individual variability across the lifespan. Although the sleep-wakefulness pattern of most toddlers includes an afternoon nap, the association between napping and circadian phase in early childhood remains unexplored. This study examined differences in circadian phase and sleep between napping and non-napping toddlers. Data were collected on 20 toddlers (34.2+/-2.0 months; 12 females; 15 nappers). Children followed their habitual napping and non-napping sleep schedules (monitored with actigraphy) for 5 days before an in-home salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) assessment. On average, napping children fell asleep during their nap opportunities on 3.6+/-1.2 of the 5 days before the DLMO assessment. For these napping children, melatonin onset time was 38 min later (p = 0.044; d = 0.93), actigraphically-estimated bedtime was 43 min later (p = 0.014; d = 1.24), sleep onset time was 59 min later (p = 0.006; d = 1.46), and sleep onset latency was 16 min longer (p = 0.030; d = 1.03) than those not napping. Midsleep and wake time did not differ by napping status. No difference was observed in the bedtime, sleep onset, or midsleep phase relationships with DLMO; however, the wake time phase difference was 47 min smaller for napping toddlers (p = 0.029; d = 1.23). On average, nappers had 69 min shorter nighttime sleep durations (p = 0.006; d = 1.47) and spent 49 min less time in bed (p = 0.019; d = 1.16) than non-nappers. Number of days napping was correlated with melatonin onset time (r = 0.49; p = 0.014). Our findings indicate that napping influences individual variability in melatonin onset time in early childhood. The delayed bedtimes of napping toddlers likely permits light exposure later in the evening, thereby delaying the timing of the clock and sleep. Whether the early developmental trajectory of circadian phase involves an advance associated with the decline in napping is a question necessitating longitudinal data as children transition from a biphasic to monophasic sleep-wakefulness pattern."
"The ventral part of the oral pontine reticular nucleus (vRPO) is a demonstrated site of brainstem REM-sleep generation and maintenance. The vRPO has reciprocal connections with structures that control other states of the sleep-wakefulness cycle, many situated in the basal forebrain and the diencephalon. Some of these connections utilize the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. The aim of the present work is to map the local origin of the basal forebrain and diencephalon projections to the vRPO whether GABAergic or non-GABAergic. A double-labelling technique combining vRPO injections of the neuronal tracer, cholera-toxin (CTB), with GAD-immunohistochemistry, was used for this purpose in adult cats. All of the numerous CTB-positive neurons in the reticular thalamic and dorsocaudal hypothalamic nuclei were double-labelled (CTB/GAD-positive) neurons. Approximately 15%, 14% and 16% of the CTB-positive neurons in the zona incerta and the dorsal and lateral hypothalamic areas are, respectively, CTB/GAD-positive neurons. However, only some double-labelled neurons were found in other hypothalamic nuclei with abundant CTB-positive neurons, such as the paraventricular nucleus, perifornical area and H1 Forel field. In addition, CTB-positive neurons were abundant in the central amygdaline nucleus, terminal stria bed nuclei, median preoptic nucleus, medial and lateral preoptic areas, dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei, posterior hypothalamic area and periventricular thalamic nucleus. The GABAergic and non-GABAergic connections described here may be the morphological pillar through which these prosencephalic structures modulate, either by inhibiting or by exciting, the vRPO REM-sleep inducing neurons during the different sleep-wakefulness cycle states."
"The nucleus pontis oralis contains several populations of neurons showing distinct sleep-waking discharge patterns. PS-on, PS-off cells, and neurons that discharged in association with phasic movements during paradoxical sleep and/or waking, were found. The findings suggest that different populations of the nucleus pontis oralis neurons take a distinct part in paradoxical sleep control."
"A computerized method of quantification, graphic representation and classification of sleep-wakefulness data in the cat before and after pontine tegmental lesions has been presented. Electrophysiological signal features including average EEG amplitude, average EMG amplitude and PGO spike rate which are particularly important for the definition of sleep-wakefulness states have been quantified for each 1 min epoch in the day. The data were presented in a projected 3-dimensional data display, in which they formed clusters that are considered to be analogous to sleep-wakefulness states. A cluster analysis algorithm was employed for the automatic classification of these data, and this automatic classification was compared graphically and with contingency table analyses to traditional visual assessment of state from polygraphic records. Although there were systematic differences in the locations of state boundaries, total percent agreement between cluster analysis classification and traditional human classification was comparable to the percent agreement between any two human classifiers (about 90%). After pontine tegmental lesions involving both the gigantocellular and lateral tegmental fields, paradoxical sleep was eliminated, and the characteristics of slow wave sleep and wakefulness were altered. The elimination of the state of paradoxical sleep was evident in the computer display by the absence of the paradoxical sleep cluster, and alterations of the other states were indicated in the display by shifts in the positions of their respective clusters. Automatic classification of slow wave sleep and wakefulness after such lesions compared well with traditional classification, attesting to the validity of this approach."
"The influence of some monoamine oxidase inhibitors (phenelzine, transamin [tranylcypromine], nialamide) on the structure of the sleep-wakefulness cycle of the cat was studied. It was shown that these monoamine oxidase inhibitors elicit and increase in slow-wave sleep in the sleep-wakefulness cycle due to complete suppression of paradoxical sleep and significant decrease in wakefulness. After the cessation of the action of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, a selective rebound of wakefulness is observed against the background of complete or partial absence of paradoxical sleep. The gives grounds for the hypothesis that during partial deprivation of wakefulness under the influence of monoamine oxidase inhibitors an intensification occurs on the accumulation of specific need for this physiological state, the satisfaction of which is accomplished as the result of its rebound in the post-deprivational cycle, i.e., after the termination of the EEG of the synchronizing effect of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors."
"Acute effects of a single i.p. injection of toluene on circadian rhythms of sleep-wakefulness were investigated in rats which were chronically implanted with EEG and EMG electrodes for polygraphic recordings. The toluene injection produced an initial increase in wakefulness (W) and a subsequent increase in slow-wave sleep (SWS) during the dark period. In an attempt to clarify mechanisms of these biphasic effects of toluene on sleep-wakefulness rhythms, brain monoamines and their metabolites were determined at the times of the initial increase in W and the increased SWS. The initial increase in W was associated with an increase in cortical NA, MHPG and 5-HT together with a decrease in cortical 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), while the increased SWS during the dark period was associated with an increase in 5-HIAA and a concomitant decrease in 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG). The toluene-induced changes in sleep-wakefulness seemed to be manifested at lower blood levels of toluene than the behavioral signs of central nervous system (CNS) depression. These biphasic effects of toluene on circadian sleep-wakefulness rhythms are discussed in terms of the reciprocal interactions between central 5-HT and NA neurons."
"The analysis of the electrophysiological features of sleep-wakefulness cycle in Wistar rats for 9h after a 6h sleep deprivation was carried out. The delay of sleep rebound (since 2.5-3 h after deprivation) was found in the form of moderate increasing of slow-wave sleep and fast-wave sleep phases. According to these sleep-wakefulness cycle changes, a quantitative immunohistochemical study of tyrosine hydroxylase: a key enzyme of dopamine synthesis--and D1 and D2 receptors in nigro-striatal projections has been performed. After sleep, an elevation of D1 receptors immunoreactivity in caudate nucleus and reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in compact part of substancia nigra was found. After postdeprivation sleep, a decrease of D1 receptors immunoreactivity and increase of D2 receptors immunoreactivity in caudate nucleus together some increase of tyrosine hydroxilase immunoreactivity in substancia nigra compacta has been observed. These data can testify about active role of dopaminergic nigrostriatal system which provide at the same time with another neurotransmitters of the central nervous system the telencephalo-diencephalic interaction in sleep-wakefulness-sleep cycle."
"For the occurrence of each state of sleep (slow wave sleep, paradoxical sleep) there are two neuronal networks. The first one called executive is responsible for the sleep phenomenology; the second called permissive is for the triggering of sleep. Wakefulness depends on a very complex system (10 structures) including the permissive networks which inhibit sleep. Sleep onset is thought as a blockade of the waking state by an antiwake network synthesizing hypnogenic factors. Such a regulation allows to suggest that insomnia is a wake trouble depending on a revisited therapy."
"The basal ganglia (BG) are involved in numerous neurobiological processes that operate on the basis of wakefulness, including motor function, learning, emotion and addictive behaviors. We hypothesized that the BG might play an important role in the regulation of wakefulness. To test this prediction, we made cell body-specific lesions in the striatum and globus pallidus (GP) using ibotenic acid. We found that rats with striatal (caudoputamen) lesions exhibited a 14.95% reduction in wakefulness and robust fragmentation of sleep-wake behavior, i.e. an increased number of state transitions and loss of ultra-long wake bouts (> 120 min). These lesions also resulted in a reduction in the diurnal variation of sleep-wakefulness. On the other hand, lesions of the accumbens core resulted in a 26.72% increase in wakefulness and a reduction in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep bout duration. In addition, rats with accumbens core lesions exhibited excessive digging and scratching. GP lesions also produced a robust increase in wakefulness (45.52%), and frequent sleep-wake transitions and a concomitant decrease in NREM sleep bout duration. Lesions of the subthalamic nucleus or the substantia nigra reticular nucleus produced only minor changes in the amount of sleep-wakefulness and did not alter sleep architecture. Finally, power spectral analysis revealed that lesions of the striatum, accumbens and GP slowed down the cortical electroencephalogram. Collectively, our results suggest that the BG, via a cortico-striato-pallidal loop, are important neural circuitry regulating sleep-wake behaviors and cortical activation."
"Dynamics of neuronal activity of the mesencephalic reticular nuclei (n. cuneiformis, n. parabrachialis) in the sleep-wakefulness cycle was studied in free moving rats using mobile metallic microelectrodes. Computer analysis and statistical treatment of data have shown that the majority of neurons in the above-mentioned reticular nuclei of the mesencephalon (76% and 66%, respectively) generate with high frequencies during active wakefulness and emotional stage of paradoxical sleep; the frequency of discharges is less during passive wakefulness and nonemotional stage of paradoxical sleep, while in the slow-wave sleep they exhibit the least activity. Comparatively small number of neurons (24%, 15%) show inverse dynamics of activity. They fire more intensively during slow wave sleep and the frequency of discharges decreases during active wakefulness and emotional stage of paradoxical sleep. During quiet wakefulness and nonemotional stage of paradoxical sleep the neuronal activity attains the level observed in a slow-wave sleep. In n. parabrachialis some neurons are found which fire intensively during active wakefulness, the frequency of their discharges decreases in passive wakefulness and slow-wave sleep and is the least in paradoxical sleep. The similarity and difference of the neurophysiological mechanisms of phases and stages of the sleep-wakefulness cycle are discussed."
"Behavioral states of rats were automatically classified with a newly developed computer program into three sleep stages (awake, slow-wave sleep and REM sleep) from continuous long-term EEG and EMG recordings for several circadian cycles under entrained circumstances (L:D = 12:12). Histamine was depleted by 100 mg/kg intraperitoneal administration of a specific inhibitor of its synthesis, alpha-fluoromethylhistidine, in the mid-light period. This treatment had no effect on the amount of each sleep stage in the total 24-h period or in the light period, but caused significant increases in slow-wave sleep and REM sleep in the dark period. Equivalent decrease in the awake stage during the dark period was also observed. As a result, histamine depletion decreased the light:dark ratio of slow-wave sleep. These findings suggest that decrease of the histamine content of the brain attenuated the circadian amplitude of sleep-wakefulness by suppressing the surge of wakefulness during the dark period. From these results, histamine is suggested to modulate the circadian amplitude of the sleep-wakefulness cycle."
"Orexin-A (ORX-A) and orexin-B (ORX-B) play critical roles in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness and feeding. ORX neurons project to the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT), which regulates waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Thus, we examined electrophysiological effects of ORXs on rat PPT neurons with a soma size of more than 30 microm. Whole cell patch clamp recording in vitro revealed that ORX-A and ORX-B depolarized PPT neurons dose-dependently in normal and/or tetrodotoxin containing artificial cerebrospinal fluids (ACSFs), and the EC(50) values for ORX-A and ORX-B were 66 nM and 536 nM, respectively. SB-334867, a selective inhibitor for ORX 1 (OX(1)) receptors, significantly suppressed the ORX-A-induced depolarization. The ORX-A-induced depolarization was reduced in high K(+) ACSF with extracellular K(+) concentration of 13.25 mM or N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG(+))-containing ACSF in which NaCl was replaced with NMDG-Cl, and abolished in high K(+)-NMDG(+) ACSF or in a combination of NMDG(+) ACSF and recordings with Cs(+)-containing pipettes. An inhibitor of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger and chelating intracellular Ca(2+) had no effect on the depolarization. Most of PPT neurons studied were characterized by an A-current or both A-current and a low threshold Ca(2+) spike, and predominantly cholinergic. These results suggest that ORXs directly depolarize PPT neurons via OX(1) receptors and via a dual ionic mechanism including a decrease of K(+) conductances and an increase of non-selective cationic conductances, and support the notion that ORX neurons affect the activity of PPT neurons directly and/or indirectly to control sleep-wakefulness, especially REM sleep."
"The sleep/wakefulness cycle was the subject of polysomonographic and actographic studies in two experiments with isolation and confinement of six volunteer operators for 135 and 90 days. The dynamics of sleep structure was the target parameter before, during, and after the experiments. The sleep structure dynamics and changes in the motor activity differed in their directionality. At all the stages of experiments the operators' sleep structure had some unique peculiarities. Discussion is centered around the cases of shortened duration of delta-sleep and altered latent periods of specific stages. During the off-nominal situation (ONS) with 45 hour sleep deprivation polysomnographs recorded episodes of latent sleep which became more multiple during the second ONS and were combined with signs of ""slow"" sleep, and increases in the index of motor activity during night sleep post ONS. Hence, adaptation to changed physical and social environments is manifested by a specific functional restructurization of the sleep/wakefulness cycle."
"The present study was carried out to elucidate whether or whether not afloqualone has a hypnotic action because of its similarity in chemical structure to methaqualone. In the sleep-wakefulness cycles during the 8-hour observation period (9:00-17:00), afloqualone increased the percentages of resting (REST) and slow wave light sleep (SWLS) stages at a dose of 25 mg/kg (p.o.), producing a moderate muscle relaxation. Even at a dose of 50 mg/kg (p.o.) where a marked muscle relaxation was produced, afloqualone had no influence on the percentage of slow wave deep sleep (SWDS) stage, though it increased the percentages of SWLS and decreased the percentages of awake (AWK), REST and fast wave sleep (FWS) stages. On the other hand, tolperisone . HCl, chlormezanone, methaqualone and pentobarbital . Na, used as the reference drugs, all increased the percentage of SWDS stage, but either decreased or had no effect on the percentages of the other four stages at pharmacologically effective doses. From these results it was concluded that afloqualone seems to be devoid of a hypnotic action and has different effects on the sleep-wakefulness cycle than those of both the hypnotics and the other muscle relaxants used."
"Several studies have suggested that noradrenergic afferents to the medial preoptic area might be involved in hypnogenesis and in lowering the body temperature, and that the alpha1 adrenergic receptors might be mediating these responses. This study was undertaken to find out the changes in sleep-wakefulness and body temperature in rats, when these adrenergic receptors of the medial preoptic area are blocked by alpha1 selective antagonist, prazosin. Adult male Wistar rats were chronically implanted with electrooculogram, electroencephalogram and electromyogram electrodes for sleep-wakefulness assessment, and a bilateral guide cannula for microinjection of prazosin at the medial preoptic area. A radio-transmitter was implanted in the abdomen for telemetric measurement of body temperature in four groups of rats. Sleep-wakefulness was also assessed telemetrically in four other groups of rats. Sleep-wakefulness recordings from these rats were done in a specialized chamber, where they could move about freely and select the ambient temperature which they prefer. Prazosin induced a dose dependent increase in wake period and in body temperature, when microinjected into the medial preoptic area. Results suggest that preoptic alpha1 adrenergic receptors mediate hypnogenic and hypothermic responses. It is proposed that the noradrenergic afferents to the medial preoptic area, by tonic activation of alpha1 adrenergic receptors, contribute towards increase in sleep especially during the daytime."
"We observed fetal behavior by using three ultrasonic real-time scanners simultaneously in 30 normal pregnant women between 20 and 40 weeks of gestation and analyzed developmental changes in behavioral pattern focussing the attention on the characteristics of REM and non-REM sleep and wakeful state. The frequency of REM significantly increased with gestational age, and its occurrences formed a group in late pregnancy. REM and non-REM periods, which were defined as the phase with uninterrupted appearance of rapid eye movements and the phase without them over 3 min, respectively, became clearly distinguishable between 28 and 31 weeks of gestation. The correlation between the occurrence of rapid eye movements and breathing movements was high after 27 weeks. These results demonstrate the course of the development of sleep-wakefulness cycle in the human fetus."
"The 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ritanserin (0.63 mg/kg IP) produced differential effects on sleep-wakefulness patterns in rats when administered during the light or dark period: an increase in the duration of deep slow wave sleep at the expense of light slow wave sleep, paradoxical sleep and wakefulness when injected during the light period, and no major sleep alteration when given at dark onset. Since circadian variations in serotonin receptor density might modulate the sleep response, we examined the effects of ritanserin on sleep in rats exposed to continuous light for 10 days, and whether 5-HT2 receptors were affected in separate groups of rats exposed to similar conditions. No significant changes in the KD- and Bmax -values of various receptors were found. However, ritanserin produced greater effects in continuous light conditions than when given during the light period in the 12-hr light-dark condition. This suggests a possible role of 5-HT2 receptors in the organization of sleep when the environmental photoperiod is disturbed."
