"INTRODUCTION: Suicidal behaviors are common in the general population and are so a major public health problem. In order to improve suicide prevention and to reduce the mortality by suicide, it appears essential to better identify suicide risk factors. Seasonality, circadian rhythms and sleep abnormalities have been already associated with numerous psychiatric disorders. This review aimed to characterize the associations between seasonality, circadian rhythms, sleep and suicidal behaviors including suicide attempts and completed suicides. METHODS: We conducted a literature search between 1973 and 2015 in PubMed databases using the following terms: (""suicide"" OR ""suicidality"" OR ""suicide attempts"" OR ""suicidal behavior"") AND (""circadian rhythms"" OR ""seasons"" OR ""sleep""). RESULTS: Many studies confirm a specific seasonality for suicide with a higher peak of suicides in spring for both sex and a lower peak in autumn especially for women. This distribution seems to correlate with depressive symptoms (especially for the autumn peak), gender and different types of suicide. Regarding gender and type of suicide differences, males more commonly commit violent suicide with a higher rate of suicides in spring. Suicide behaviors appear to be influenced by climatic and biological factors like sunshine, daylight cycles, temperature, air pollutants, viruses, parasites and aeroallergens. Circadian variations exist in suicide rates depending on age with a morning peak for elder and an evening peak for youth. In addition, completed suicide peak in early morning whereas suicide attempts peak rather in later afternoon. Several biomarkers dysregulation like melatonin, serotonin and cortisol may be implicated in suicide circadian variations. Furthermore, specific sleep disorders like insomnia, nightmares and sleep deprivation are common risk factors of suicide and possibly independently of the presence of depressive symptoms. Finally, the efficacy of chronotherapeutics (such as luminotherapy, dark therapy, sleep deprivation and melatonin drugs) has been suggested in the reduction of suicidal behaviors. CONCLUSION: The suicide seasonality is very well documented showing a main peak in spring and another one in autumn. A suicide circadian distribution also exists depending of the suicidal behavior intensity and of the age. Numerous sleep disorders are also suicide risk factors and can be treated with chronotherapeutics. A better identification of seasonality, circadian rhythms and sleep abnormalities in suicidal behaviors could allow a better prevention in suicidal attempts and a reduction in death by suicide."
"UNLABELLED: Nocturnal polyuria in monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE) has so far mainly been attributed to a disturbed circadian rhythm of renal water handling. Low vasopressin levels overnight correlate with absent maximal concentrating activity, resulting in an increased nocturnal diuresis with low urinary osmolality. Therefore, treatment with desmopressin is a rational choice. Unfortunately, 20 to 60 % of children with monosymptomatic enuresis are desmopressin-resistant. There is increasing evidence that other disturbed circadian rhythms might play a role in nocturnal polyuria. This review focuses on renal aspects in the pathophysiology of nocturnal polyuria in MNE, with special emphasis on circadian rhythms. Articles related to renal circadian rhythms and enuresis were searched through the PubMed library with the goal of providing a concise review. CONCLUSION: Nocturnal polyuria can only partially be explained by blunted circadian rhythm of vasopressin secretion. Other alterations in the intrinsic renal circadian clock system also seem to be involved, especially in desmopressin-resistant enuresis. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Disturbance in the circadian rhythm of arginine vasopressin secretion is related to nocturnal polyuria in children with enuresis. * Desmopressin is recommended as a treatment for monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis, working as a vasopressin analogue acting on V2 receptors in the collecting ducts of the kidney. What is New: * Other renal circadian rhythms might play a role in nocturnal polyuria, especially in desmopressin-resistant case."
"The temporal order of physiology and behavior in mammals is primarily regulated by the circadian pacemaker located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Taking advantage of bioluminescence reporters, we monitored the circadian rhythms of the expression of clock genes Per1 and Bmal1 in the SCN of freely moving mice and found that the rate of phase shifts induced by a single light pulse was different in the two rhythms. The Per1-luc rhythm was phase-delayed instantaneously by the light presented at the subjective evening in parallel with the activity onset of behavioral rhythm, whereas the Bmal1-ELuc rhythm was phase-delayed gradually, similar to the activity offset. The dissociation was confirmed in cultured SCN slices of mice carrying both Per1-luc and Bmal1-ELuc reporters. The two rhythms in a single SCN slice showed significantly different periods in a long-term (3 wk) culture and were internally desynchronized. Regional specificity in the SCN was not detected for the period of Per1-luc and Bmal1-ELuc rhythms. Furthermore, neither is synchronized with circadian intracellular Ca(2+) rhythms monitored by a calcium indicator, GCaMP6s, or with firing rhythms monitored on a multielectrode array dish, although the coupling between the circadian firing and Ca(2+) rhythms persisted during culture. These findings indicate that the expressions of two key clock genes, Per1 and Bmal1, in the SCN are regulated in such a way that they may adopt different phases and free-running periods relative to each other and are respectively associated with the expression of activity onset and offset."
"This study was aimed to explore the mechanisms underlying cadmium-induced circadian rhythms disruption. Two groups of zebrafish larvae treated with or without 5 ppm CdCl2 were incubated in a photoperiod of 14-h light/10-h dark conditions. The mRNA levels of clock1a, bmal1b, per2 and per1b in two groups were determined. Microarray data were generated in two group of samples. Differential expression of genes were identified and the changes in expression level for some genes were validated by RT-PCR. Finally, Gene Ontology functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were performed. In comparison with normal group, the mRNA levels of clock1a, bmal1b, and per2 were significantly changed and varied over the circadian cycle in CdCl2-treated group. DEGs were obtained from the light (84 h, ZT12) and dark (88 h, ZT16) phase. In addition, G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway and immune response were both enriched by DEGs in both groups. While, proteolysis and amino acid metabolism were found associated with DEGs in light phase, and Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and oxidation-reduction process were significantly enriched by DEGs in dark phase. Besides, the expression pattern of genes including hsp70l and or115-11 obtained by RT-PCR were consistent with those obtained by microarray analysis. As a consequence, cadmium could make significant effects on circadian rhythms through immune response and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. Besides, between the dark and the light phase, the mechanism by which cadmium inducing disruption of circadian rhythms were different to some extent."
"We report a progressive disruption of 24-h rhythms in fasting blood glucose (FBG), body temperature (BT) and heart rate (HR) associated with metabolic dysfunction and the development of prediabetes (PD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in overweight middle-aged (40-69 years old) humans. Increasing BT and HR mean values and declining 24-h BT and HR amplitudes accompany adverse changes in metabolic state. Increased nocturnal BT and a phase delay of the 24-h BT rhythm, deviant 24-h HR profile and a phase advance of the 24-h HR and FBG rhythms are early signs of the PD metabolic state. In T2DM, the 24-h FBG rhythm is no longer detectable, and the 24-h amplitudes of BT and HR are greatly diminished. In addition, lepton and creatinine values were lowered in T2DM. Moreover, positive correlations between FBG and body mass index, BMI, and negative correlations between the 24-h amplitude of FBG and BMI indicate that overweight is an additional factor causing disruption of the circadian rhythms. Further studies on circadian disruption as a consequence of metabolic dysfunction are necessary. The quantitative analysis of changing circadian BT and HR rhythms may provide prognostic markers of T2DM and therapeutic targets for its prevention and correction."
"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a frequent neurodevelopmental disorder. ASD is probably the result of intricate interactions between genes and environment altering progressively the development of brain structures and functions. Circadian rhythms are a complex intrinsic timing system composed of almost as many clocks as there are body cells. They regulate a variety of physiological and behavioral processes such as the sleep-wake rhythm. ASD is often associated with sleep disorders and low levels of melatonin. This first point raises the hypothesis that circadian rhythms could have an implication in ASD etiology. Moreover, circadian rhythms are generated by auto-regulatory genetic feedback loops, driven by transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1, who drive transcription daily patterns of a wide number of clock-controlled genes (CCGs) in different cellular contexts across tissues. Among these, are some CCGs coding for synapses molecules associated to ASD susceptibility. Furthermore, evidence emerges about circadian rhythms control of time brain development processes."
"Many behaviors and physiological processes oscillate with circadian rhythms that are synchronized to environmental cues (e.g. light onset), but persist with periods of ~24 h in the absence of such cues. We used a multilevel experimental approach to assess whether circadian rhythms modulate several aspects of the visual physiology and behavior of the praying mantis Hierodula patellifera. We used electroretinograms (ERGs) to assess compound eye sensitivity, colorimetric photographic analyses to assess compound eye color changes (screening pigment migration), behavioral assays of responsiveness to computer-generated prey-like visual stimuli and analyses of locomotor activity patterns on a modified treadmill apparatus. Our results indicate that circadian clocks control and/or modulate each of the target behaviors. Strong rhythms, persisting under constant conditions, with periods of ~24 h were evident in photoreceptor sensitivity to light, appetitive responsiveness to prey-like stimuli and gross locomotor activity. In the first two cases, responsiveness was highest during the subjective night and lowest during the subjective day. Locomotor activity was strongly clustered around the transition time from day to night. In addition, pigment migration and locomotor behavior responded strongly to light:dark cycles and anticipated the light-dark transition, suggesting that the circadian clocks modulating both were entrained to environmental light cues. Together, these data indicate that circadian rhythms operate at the cellular, cellular systems and organismal level in H. patellifera. Our results represent an intriguing first step in uncovering the complexities of circadian rhythms in the Mantodea."
"Metabolic state and circadian clock function exhibit a complex bidirectional relationship. Circadian disruption increases propensity for metabolic dysfunction, whereas common metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are associated with impaired circadian rhythms. Specifically, alterations in glucose availability and glucose metabolism have been shown to modulate clock gene expression and function in vitro; however, to date, it is unknown whether development of diabetes imparts deleterious effects on the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) circadian clock and SCN-driven outputs in vivo. To address this question, we undertook studies in aged diabetic rats transgenic for human islet amyloid polypeptide, an established nonobese model of T2DM (HIP rat), which develops metabolic defects closely recapitulating those present in patients with T2DM. HIP rats were also cross-bred with a clock gene reporter rat model (Per1:luciferase transgenic rat) to permit assessment of the SCN and the peripheral molecular clock function ex vivo. Utilizing these animal models, we examined effects of diabetes on 1) behavioral circadian rhythms, 2) photic entrainment of circadian activity, 3) SCN and peripheral tissue molecular clock function, and 4) melatonin secretion. We report that circadian activity, light-induced entrainment, molecular clockwork, as well as melatonin secretion are preserved in the HIP rat model of T2DM. These results suggest that despite the well-characterized ability of glucose to modulate circadian clock gene expression acutely in vitro, SCN clock function and key behavioral and physiological outputs appear to be preserved under chronic diabetic conditions characteristic of nonobese T2DM."
"Circadian rhythms are based on endogenous clocks that allow organisms to adjust their physiology and behavior by entrainment to the solar day and, in turn, to select the optimal times for most biological variables. Diverse model systems-including mice, flies, fungi, plants, and bacteria-have provided important insights into the mechanisms of circadian rhythmicity. However, the general principles that govern the circadian clock of Caenorhabditis elegans have remained largely elusive. Here we report robust molecular circadian rhythms in C elegans recorded with a bioluminescence assay in vivo and demonstrate the main features of the circadian system of the nematode. By constructing a luciferase-based reporter coupled to the promoter of the suppressor of activated let-60 Ras (sur-5) gene, we show in both population and single-nematode assays that C elegans expresses approximately 24-h rhythms that can be entrained by light/dark and temperature cycles. We provide evidence that these rhythms are temperature-compensated and can be re-entrained after phase changes of the synchronizing agents. In addition, we demonstrate that light and temperature sensing requires the photoreceptors LITE and GUR-3, and the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunit TAX-2. Our results shed light on C elegans circadian biology and demonstrate evolutionarily conserved features in the circadian system of the nematode."
"Continuous recordings of core body temperature (CBT) are a well-established approach in describing circadian rhythms. Given the discomfort of invasive CBT measurement techniques, the use of skin temperature recordings has been proposed as a surrogate. More recently, we proposed a heat-flux approach (the so-called Double Sensor) for monitoring CBT. Studies investigating the reliability of the heat-flux approach over a 24-hour period, as well as comparisons with skin temperature recordings, are however lacking. The first aim of the study was therefore to compare rectal, skin, and heat-flux temperature recordings for monitoring circadian rhythm. In addition, to assess the optimal placement of sensor probes, we also investigated the effect of different anatomical measurement sites, i.e. sensor probes positioned at the forehead vs. the sternum. Data were collected as part of the Berlin BedRest study (BBR2-2) under controlled, standardized, and thermoneutral conditions. 24-hours temperature data of seven healthy males were collected after 50 days of -6 degrees head-down tilt bed-rest. Mean Pearson correlation coefficients indicated a high association between rectal and forehead temperature recordings (r > 0.80 for skin and Double Sensor). In contrast, only a poor to moderate relationship was observed for sensors positioned at the sternum (r = -0.02 and r = 0.52 for skin and Double Sensor, respectively). Cross-correlation analyses further confirmed the feasibility of the forehead as a preferred monitoring site. The phase difference between forehead Double Sensor and rectal recordings was not statistically different from zero (p = 0.313), and was significantly smaller than the phase difference between forehead skin and rectal temperatures (p = 0.016). These findings were substantiated by cosinor analyses, revealing significant differences for mesor, amplitude, and acrophase between rectal and forehead skin temperature recordings, but not between forehead Double Sensor and rectal temperature measurements. Finally, Bland-Altman analysis indicated narrower limits of agreement for rhythm parameters between rectal and Double Sensor measurements compared to between rectal and skin recordings, irrespective of the measurement site (i.e. forehead, sternum). Based on these data we conclude that (1) Double Sensor recordings are significantly superior to skin temperature measurements for non-invasively assessing the circadian rhythm of rectal temperature, and (2) temperature rhythms from the sternum are less reliable than from the forehead. We suggest that forehead Double Sensor recordings may provide a surrogate for rectal temperature in circadian rhythm research, where constant routine protocols are applied. Future studies will be needed to assess the sensor's ecological validity outside the laboratory under changing environmental and physiological conditions."
"While disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle are common in people with affective disorders, the characteristics of these disturbances differ greatly between individuals. This heterogeneity is likely to reflect multiple underlying pathophysiologies, with different perturbations in circadian systems contributing to the variation in sleep-wake cycle disturbances. Such disturbances may be particularly relevant in adolescents and young adults with affective disorders as circadian rhythms undergo considerable change during this key developmental period. This study aimed to identify profiles of sleep-wake disturbance in young people with affective disorders and investigate associations with biological circadian rhythms. Fifty young people with affective disorders and 19 control participants (aged 16-31 years) underwent actigraphy monitoring for approximately two weeks to derive sleep-wake cycle parameters, and completed an in-laboratory assessment including evening dim-light saliva collection for melatonin assay and overnight continuous core body temperature measurement. Cluster analysis based on sleep-wake cycle parameters identified three distinct patient groups, characterised by 'delayed sleep-wake', 'disrupted sleep', and 'long sleep' respectively. The 'delayed sleep-wake' group had both delayed melatonin onset and core temperature nadir; whereas the other two cluster groups did not differ from controls on these circadian markers. The three groups did not differ on clinical characteristics. These results provide evidence that only some types of sleep-wake disturbance in young people with affective disorders are associated with fundamental circadian perturbations. Consequently, interventions targeting endogenous circadian rhythms to promote a phase shift may be particularly relevant in youth with affective disorders presenting with delayed sleep-wake cycles."
"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the circadian rhythmic alterations of plasma hormone and peptide induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress(CUMS). METHODS: Sixty male SD rats were randomly divided into two groups, model group and control group(n=30). Rats in model group received CUMS procedure (restraint, rotation, cage tilt, wet sawdust, cold, crowding, food or water deprivation, clamp tail and reverse light/dark cycle). Rats were randomly exposed to two stressors every day for 3 weeks. Exploratory locomotor activity was assessed by open field test and anxiety-like behavior was measured by elevated plus-maze test, and lack of pleasure by sucrose preference test. Blood samples were collected at each of six time points zeitgeber time (ZT1, 5, 9, 13, 17 and 21), 5 rats were executed at each time point. Plasma concentrations of corticosterone(CORT), melatonin (MT) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were detected by ELISA kits, and plasma concentration of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was determined by radioimmunoassay. The circadian rhythm changes of serum CORT, MT, VIP and ACTH in each group were compared by using cosinor. RESULTS: Compared with control group, locomotor activity, rearing, weight gain and sucrose consumption in model group were decreased significantly. The values of the percentage of open-arm time (OT) and open arm entries (OE) were obviously lower in the model group than those in the control group. The circadian rhythm of plasma ACTH and CORT showed an obvious disorder, including phase advance and decrease in amplitude, and markedly blunted circadian rhythm. There also showed a markedly blunted circadian rhythm and decreased levels of plasma MT. VIP still had 24-hour rhythm, but the amplitude was significantly lower, peak phase also delayed for six hours, and expression was significantly higher. CONCLUSIONS: CUMS induces these peptides and hormones desynchronized from suprachiasmatic nucleus(SCN), manifested as the disturbed circadian rhythms and the abnormal hormone secretion of these synchronizers."
"There has been a lot of effort by scientists to elucidate the multi functions of the naturally occurring hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). However, to plan research experiments optimally, it is important first to characterize the diurnal rhythm in healthy individuals. The aim of this research was to investigate the daily circadian rhythms of DHEA among the 2 genders, and the effect of age and exercise on salivary DHEA circadian rhythms. Volunteers (20-39 and 40-60 years) were recruited for 2 studies investigating the salivary DHEA circadian rhythm. The first study looked at the effect of gender and age on DHEA levels on 2 non-consecutive days, and the second study explored the effect of exercise on DHEA circadian rhythm in males. DHEA levels were estimated by a sensitive and specific ELISA method. The results showed a clear daily circadian rhythm in salivary DHEA in all participants groups, however the profile was flatter in the older female group. There was a significant difference between age and gender groups particularly at 8.00 h. In young males DHEA reduced from 541.1 +/- 101.3 (mean +/- sd) at 8.00 h to 198.9 +/- 90.7 pg/mL at 18.00 h; p<0.0001, and young females from 401.6 +/- 149.5 to 215.4 +/- 95.3 pg/mL; p<0.001. In older males DHEA reduced from 267.5 +/- 32.4 to 132.5 +/- 46.7 pg/mL; p<0.001, and older females from 147.7 +/- 78.1 to 89.5 +/- 29.1 pg/mL; p=0.05. DHEA levels on 2 non-consecutive days showed some variations but this was not significant. Aerobic exercise has significantly increased DHEA levels at 2 time points of the day (p=0.05) in male subjects. In conclusion, our study showed a clear daily circadian rhythm in salivary DHEA in all participants was observed, but the profile was flatter in the older groups."
"Variations in the human fat mass and obesity-associated gene, which encodes FTO, an 2-oxoglutarate-dependent nucleic acid demethylase, are associated with increased risk of obesity. These FTO variations were recently shown to affect IRX3 and the exact function of FTO is still controversial. Obesity is closely linked to circadian rhythm. To understand the role of FTO in circadian rhythm, we analyzed the circadian rhythm of FTO deficient mice. FTO deficient mice had robust circadian locomotor activity rhythms with prolonged periods. The light-induced phase shifts of circadian rhythms were also significantly affected in FTO deficient mice. Tissue explants of FTO deficient mice maintained robust peripheral rhythms with prolonged period. Overexpress of FTO represses the transcriptional activation by CLOCK and BMAL1. Core clock genes expression of mRNA and protein were also altered in FTO deficient mice. Furthermore, FTO co-immunoprecipitated with CRY1/2 in a circadian manner. These results indicate a fundamental link between the circadian rhythm and FTO and extend the function of FTO to the core clockwork machinery."
"The measurement of circulating levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been proposed to be a marker of disease and an indicator of recovery. Thus, knowing the temporal pattern and influence of potential circadian rhythms is important. Although several studies have measured BDNF at different times of day, no studies have done so while controlling for potential masking influences such as sleep and activity. Further, no previous study has examined circadian rhythms within individuals. We examined circadian rhythms in plasma BDNF while minimizing masking from behavioral and environmental factors using a 30-h constant routine (CR) protocol. In a sample of 39 healthy adults, we found significant circadian rhythms in 75% of women and 52% of men. The timing of the acrophase of the BDNF rhythm, however, was unrelated to clock time in women, while it was related to clock time in men. These results indicate that the use of single-sample measures of plasma BDNF as a marker of disease will be unreliable, especially in women. Repeated plasma BDNF samples over a 24-h period within individuals would be needed to reveal abnormalities related to disease states."
"BACKGROUND: Despite the high prevalence of infantile colic, the pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Cortisol and melatonin hormones affect gastrointestinal system development in several ways, and interestingly, both cortisol and melatonin's circadian rhythms begin around the 3rd month in which infantile colic symptoms start to decrease. We hypothesized that infantile colic might associate with desynchronization of normal circadian rhythms of these hormones. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of melatonin and cortisol in the pathogenesis of infantile colic. METHODS: Patients who were diagnosed as infantile colic according to Wessel's ""rule of three"" were enrolled in the colic group. We measured the saliva melatonin and cortisol levels of colic group and control group infants. In both groups, the saliva samples were taken in mornings and at evenings, at the time of diagnosis and 6th month. RESULTS: Fifty-five infants finished the study. Melatonin circadian rhythm developed earlier in the control group than the infantile colic group in our study. We found no significant difference between the daily mean cortisol levels. However, infants with colic had flatter daily cortisol slope than controls which pointed out the probability that they had a less clearly defined cortisol rhythm than infants without colic. CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between melatonin levels and infantile colic. However, more research is needed to fully understand the role of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and hormone's role on infantile colic physiopathology."
"Disruption of circadian rhythms is a risk factor for several human gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, ranging from diarrhea to ulcers to cancer. Four-dimensional tissue culture models that faithfully mimic the circadian clock of the GI epithelium would provide an invaluable tool to understand circadian regulation of GI health and disease. We hypothesized that rhythmicity of a key circadian component, PERIOD2 (PER2), would diminish along a continuum from ex vivo intestinal organoids (epithelial 'miniguts'), nontransformed mouse small intestinal epithelial (MSIE) cells and transformed human colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells. Here, we show that bioluminescent jejunal explants from PERIOD2::LUCIFERASE (PER2::LUC) mice displayed robust circadian rhythms for >72 hours post-excision. Circadian rhythms in primary or passaged PER2::LUC jejunal organoids were similarly robust; they also synchronized upon serum shock and persisted beyond 2 weeks in culture. Remarkably, unshocked organoids autonomously synchronized rhythms within 12 hours of recording. The onset of this autonomous synchronization was slowed by >2 hours in the presence of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 (20 muM). Doubling standard concentrations of the organoid growth factors EGF, Noggin and R-spondin enhanced PER2 oscillations, whereas subtraction of these factors individually at 24 hours following serum shock produced no detectable effects on PER2 oscillations. Growth factor pulses induced modest phase delays in unshocked, but not serum-shocked, organoids. Circadian oscillations of PER2::LUC bioluminescence aligned with Per2 mRNA expression upon analysis using quantitative PCR. Concordant findings of robust circadian rhythms in bioluminescent jejunal explants and organoids provide further evidence for a peripheral clock that is intrinsic to the intestinal epithelium. The rhythmic and organotypic features of organoids should offer unprecedented advantages as a resource for elucidating the role of circadian rhythms in GI stem cell dynamics, epithelial homeostasis and disease."
"Circadian rhythms are 24-hr oscillations that control a variety of biological processes in living systems, including two hallmarks of cancer, cell division and metabolism. Circadian rhythm disruption by shift work is associated with greater risk for cancer development and poor prognosis, suggesting a putative tumor-suppressive role for circadian rhythm homeostasis. Using a genetically engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, we have characterized the effects of circadian rhythm disruption on lung tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that both physiologic perturbation (jet lag) and genetic mutation of the central circadian clock components decreased survival and promoted lung tumor growth and progression. The core circadian genes Per2 and Bmal1 were shown to have cell-autonomous tumor-suppressive roles in transformation and lung tumor progression. Loss of the central clock components led to increased c-Myc expression, enhanced proliferation, and metabolic dysregulation. Our findings demonstrate that both systemic and somatic disruption of circadian rhythms contribute to cancer progression."
"A variety of environmental factors contribute to progressive development of osteoarthritis (OA). Environmental factors that upset circadian rhythms have been linked to various diseases. Our recent work establishes chronic environmental circadian disruption - analogous to rotating shiftwork-associated disruption of circadian rhythms in humans - as a novel risk factor for the development of OA. Evidence suggests shift workers are prone to obesity and also show altered eating habits (i.e., increased preference for high-fat containing food). In the present study, we investigated the impact of chronic circadian rhythm disruption in combination with a high-fat diet (HFD) on progression of OA in a mouse model. Our study demonstrates that when mice with chronically circadian rhythms were fed a HFD, there was a significant proteoglycan (PG) loss and fibrillation in knee joint as well as increased activation of the expression of the catabolic mediators involved in cartilage homeostasis. Our results, for the first time, provide the evidence that environmental disruption of circadian rhythms plus HFD potentiate OA-like pathological changes in the mouse joints. Thus, our findings may open new perspectives on the interactions of chronic circadian rhythms disruption with diet in the development of OA and may have potential clinical implications."
"The circadian clock establishes rhythms throughout the body with an approximately 24 hour period that affect expression of hundreds of genes. Epidemiological data reveal chronic circadian misalignment, common in our society, significantly increases the risk for a myriad of diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, infertility and gastrointestinal disease. Disruption of intestinal barrier function, also known as gut leakiness, is especially important in alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Several studies have shown that alcohol causes ALD in only a 20-30% subset of alcoholics. Thus, a better understanding is needed of why only a subset of alcoholics develops ALD. Compelling evidence shows that increased gut leakiness to microbial products and especially LPS play a critical role in the pathogenesis of ALD. Clock and other circadian clock genes have been shown to regulate lipid transport, motility and other gut functions. We hypothesized that one possible mechanism for alcohol-induced intestinal hyperpermeability is through disruption of central or peripheral (intestinal) circadian regulation. In support of this hypothesis, our recent data shows that disruption of circadian rhythms makes the gut more susceptible to injury. Our in vitro data show that alcohol stimulates increased Clock and Per2 circadian clock proteins and that siRNA knockdown of these proteins prevents alcohol-induced permeability. We also show that intestinal Cyp2e1-mediated oxidative stress is required for alcohol-induced upregulation of Clock and Per2 and intestinal hyperpermeability. Our mouse model of chronic alcohol feeding shows that circadian disruption through genetics (in Clock(triangle up19) mice) or environmental disruption by weekly 12h phase shifting results in gut leakiness alone and exacerbates alcohol-induced gut leakiness and liver pathology. Our data in human alcoholics show they exhibit abnormal melatonin profiles characteristic of circadian disruption. Taken together our data support circadian mechanisms for alcohol-induced gut leakiness that could provide new therapeutic targets for ALD."
"Dysregulation of collagen synthesis is associated with disease progression in cancer and fibrosis. Collagen synthesis is coordinated with the circadian clock, which in cancer cells is, curiously, deregulated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We hypothesized interplay between circadian rhythm, collagen synthesis, and ER stress in normal cells. Here we show that fibroblasts with ER stress lack circadian rhythms in gene expression upon clock-synchronizing time cues. Overexpression of binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) or treatment with chemical chaperones strengthens the oscillation amplitude of circadian rhythms. The significance of these findings was explored in tendon, where we showed that BiP expression is ramped preemptively prior to a surge in collagen synthesis at night, thereby preventing protein misfolding and ER stress. In turn, this forestalls activation of the unfolded protein response in order for circadian rhythms to be maintained. Thus, targeting ER stress could be used to modulate circadian rhythm and restore collagen homeostasis in disease.-Pickard, A., Chang, J., Alachkar, N., Calverley, B., Garva, R., Arvan, P., Meng, Q.-J., Kadler, K. E. Preservation of circadian rhythms by the protein folding chaperone, BiP."
"Disrupted circadian rhythms are a recognized effect of depression, and our previous article demonstrated an association between depression and premature aging, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In the present study, we used a mouse model of chronic corticosterone (CORT)-treated depression to elucidate a mechanism by which depression may be associated with the circadian clock and mediate age-related phenotypes. Mice received a daily injection of 20 mg/kg CORT for 21 consecutive days, and the depression-like behaviors of mice were identified by the sucrose intake test, tail suspension test and open field test. Our findings indicated that CORT injection may be correlated with the circadian clock by impairing circadian rhythms or shifting the phase values of clock genes. We also showed that CORT-treated mice exhibited a significant gradual reduction in body weight gain with increased oxidative stress, including reduced activity of antioxidant-related enzymes, reduced glutathione:glutathione disulfide ratio and cytochrome (Cyt)-C level, and elevated reactive oxygen species content. Moreover, chronic CORT injection affected inflammatory responses, the production of mitochondrial ATP and telomere shortening, which may be associated with the Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) signaling pathway. Additionally, chronic CORT injection disrupted the circadian rhythms of some indexes of aging phenotypes and altered the phase values of these indexes. Our findings suggest that psychologically stressful conditions such as depression are linked to changes in circadian rhythms and age-related phenotypes."
"In plants, the circadian system controls a plethora of processes, many with agronomic importance, such as photosynthesis, photoprotection, stomatal opening, and photoperiodic development, as well as molecular processes, such as gene expression. It has been suggested that modifying circadian rhythms may be a means to manipulate crops to develop improved plants for agriculture. However, there is very little information on how the clock influences the performance of crop plants. We used a noninvasive, high-throughput technique, based on prompt chlorophyll fluorescence, to measure circadian rhythms and demonstrated that the technique works in a range of plants. Using fluorescence, we analyzed circadian rhythms in populations of wild barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum) from widely different ecogeographical locations in the Southern Levant part of the Fertile Crescent, an area with a high proportion of the total genetic variation of wild barley. Our results show that there is variability for circadian traits in the wild barley lines. We observed that circadian period lengths were correlated with temperature and aspect at the sites of origin of the plants, while the amplitudes of the rhythms were correlated with soil composition. Thus, different environmental parameters may exert selection on circadian rhythms."
"Circadian rhythms of parasites and their hosts can influence processes such as transmission, pathology and life cycle evolution. For trematode parasites that depend on free-living infectious stages (i.e. cercariae) to move among host species, the timing of parasite release is hypothesized to increase the likelihood of contacting a host. Yet, a persistent challenge in studying such biorhythms involves selection of appropriate analytical techniques. Here, we extend a generalized linear mixed modelling (GLMM) framework to cosinor analyses, thereby allowing flexibility in the statistical distribution of the response variable, incorporation of multiple covariates and inclusion of hierarchical grouping effects. By applying this approach to 93 snails infected with trematode parasites from freshwater pond ecosystems, we detected non-random rhythms in six of eight species, with variation in both the timing of peak cercariae release (between 5:10 and 21:46 h) and its magnitude (between 13 and 386). The use of GLMM yielded more accurate and precise estimates of the cosinor parameters compared with classical least-squares (LS) based on a simulation-based sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the amplitude and rhythm-adjusted mean values from the LS models diverged from the true values at some limits. We highlight the importance of novel analytical approaches for evaluating parasite circadian rhythms and investigating their underlying mechanisms."
"Light is one of the strongest environmental time cues for entraining endogenous circadian rhythms. Emerging evidence indicates that CREB-regulated transcription co-activator 1 (CRTC1) is a key player in this pathway, stimulating light-induced Period1 (Per1) transcription in mammalian clocks. Here, we demonstrate a light-independent role of Drosophila CRTC in sustaining circadian behaviors. Genomic deletion of the crtc locus causes long but poor locomotor rhythms in constant darkness. Overexpression or RNA interference-mediated depletion of CRTC in circadian pacemaker neurons similarly impairs the free-running behavioral rhythms, implying that Drosophila clocks are sensitive to the dosage of CRTC. The crtc null mutation delays the overall phase of circadian gene expression yet it remarkably dampens light-independent oscillations of TIMELESS (TIM) proteins in the clock neurons. In fact, CRTC overexpression enhances CLOCK/CYCLE (CLK/CYC)-activated transcription from tim but not per promoter in clock-less S2 cells whereas CRTC depletion suppresses it. Consistently, TIM overexpression partially but significantly rescues the behavioral rhythms in crtc mutants. Taken together, our data suggest that CRTC is a novel co-activator for the CLK/CYC-activated tim transcription to coordinate molecular rhythms with circadian behaviors over a 24-hour time-scale. We thus propose that CRTC-dependent clock mechanisms have co-evolved with selective clock genes among different species."
"Honey bee (Apis mellifera) workers emerge from the pupae with no circadian rhythms in behavior or brain clock gene expression but show strong rhythms later in life. This postembryonic development of circadian rhythms is reminiscent of that of infants of humans and other primates but contrasts with most insects, which typically emerge from the pupae with strong circadian rhythms. Very little is known about the internal and external factors regulating the ontogeny of circadian rhythms in bees or in other animals. We tested the hypothesis that the environment during early life influences the later expression of circadian rhythms in locomotor activity in young honey bees. We reared newly emerged bees in various social environments, transferred them to individual cages in constant laboratory conditions, and monitored their locomotor activity. We found that the percentage of rhythmic individuals among bees that experienced the colony environment for their first 48 h of adult life was similar to that of older sister foragers, but their rhythms were weaker. Sister bees isolated individually in the laboratory for the same period were significantly less likely to show circadian rhythms in locomotor activity. Bees experiencing the colony environment for only 24 h, or staying for 48 h with 30 same-age sister bees in the laboratory, were similar to bees individually isolated in the laboratory. By contrast, bees that were caged individually or in groups in single- or double-mesh enclosures inside a field colony were as likely to exhibit circadian rhythms as their sisters that were freely moving in the same colony. These findings suggest that the development of the circadian system in young adult honey bees is faster in the colony than in isolation. Direct contact with the queen, workers, or the brood, contact pheromones, and trophallaxis, which are all important means of communication in honey bees, cannot account for the influence of the colony environment, since they were all withheld from the bees in the double-mesh enclosures. Our results suggest that volatile pheromones, the colony microenvironment, or both influence the ontogeny of circadian rhythms in honey bees."
"PURPOSE: This article reviews the recent advances in understanding of the fundamental properties of circadian rhythms and discusses the clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSDs). RECENT FINDINGS: Recent evidence strongly points to the ubiquitous influence of circadian timing in nearly all physiologic functions. Thus, in addition to the prominent sleep and wake disturbances, circadian rhythm disorders are associated with cognitive impairment, mood disturbances, and increased risk of cardiometabolic disorders. The recent availability of biomarkers of circadian timing in clinical practice has improved our ability to identify and treat these CRSDs. SUMMARY: Circadian rhythms are endogenous rhythms with a periodicity of approximately 24 hours. These rhythms are synchronized to the physical environment by social and work schedules by various photic and nonphotic stimuli. CRSDs result from a misalignment between the timing of the circadian rhythm and the external environment (eg, jet lag and shift work) or a dysfunction of the circadian clock or its afferent and efferent pathways (eg, delayed sleep-phase, advanced sleep-phase, non-24-hour, and irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorders). The most common symptoms of these disorders are difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance and excessive sleepiness that are associated with impaired social and occupational functioning. Effective treatment for most of the CRSDs requires a multimodal approach to accelerate circadian realignment with timed exposure to light, avoidance of bright light at inappropriate times, and adherence to scheduled sleep and wake times. In addition, pharmacologic agents are recommended for some of the CRSDs. For delayed sleep-phase, non-24-hour, and shift work disorders, timed low-dose melatonin can help advance or entrain circadian rhythms; and for shift work disorder, wake-enhancing agents such as caffeine, modafinil, and armodafinil are options for the management of excessive sleepiness."
"The rotation of the earth and associated alternating cycles of light and dark--the basis of our circadian rhythms--are fundamental to human biology and culture. However, it was not until 1971 that researchers first began to describe the molecular mechanisms for the circadian system. During the past few years, groundbreaking research has revealed a multitude of circadian genes affecting a variety of clinical diseases, including diabetes, obesity, sepsis, cardiac ischemia, and sudden cardiac death. Anesthesiologists, in the operating room and intensive care units, manage these diseases on a daily basis as they significantly affect patient outcomes. Intriguingly, sedatives, anesthetics, and the intensive care unit environment have all been shown to disrupt the circadian system in patients. In the current review, we will discuss how newly acquired knowledge of circadian rhythms could lead to changes in clinical practice and new therapeutic concepts."
"The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the master pacemaker that drives circadian behaviors. SCN neurons have intrinsic, self-sustained rhythmicity that is governed by transcription-translation feedback loops. Intrinsic rhythms within the SCN do not match the day-night cycle and are therefore entrained by light-derived cues. Such cues are transmitted to the SCN by a class of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). In the present study, we sought to identify how axons from ipRGCs target the SCN. While none of the potential targeting cues identified appeared necessary for retinohypothalamic innervation, we unexpectedly identified a novel role for the extracellular matrix protein F-spondin in circadian behavior. In the absence of F-spondin, mice lost their ability to maintain typical intrinsic rhythmicity. Moreover, F-spondin loss results in the displacement of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing neurons, a class of neurons that are essential for maintaining rhythmicity among SCN neurons. Thus, this study highlights a novel role for F-spondin in maintaining circadian rhythms."
"Despite a complex relationship between mood, sleep and rhythm, the impact of circadian disruptions on bipolar disorder (BD) has not been clarified. The purpose of this systematic review was to define current evidence regarding chronotype and circadian rhythm patterns in BD patients. 42 studies were included, involving 3432 BD patients. Disruption of the biological rhythm was identified, even in drug-naive BD patients and independently of mood status. Daily profiles of melatonin levels and cortisol indicated a delayed phase. Depression was more frequently associated with circadian alterations than euthymia. Few studies evaluated mania, demonstrating irregular rhythms. Evening type was more common in BD adults. Studies about the influence of chronotype on depressive symptoms showed conflicting results. Only one investigation observed the influences of chronotype in mania, revealing no significant association. Effects of psychoeducation and lithium on rhythm in BD patients were poorly studied, demonstrating no improvement of rhythm parameters. Studies about genetics are incipient. In conclusion, disruption in circadian rhythm and eveningness are common in BD. Prospective research evaluating the impact of circadian disruption on mood symptoms, metabolism, seasonality, the influence of age and the effects of mood stabilizers are needed."
"Schizophrenia has long been associated with abnormalities in circadian rhythms and sleep. Up until now, there have been no thorough reviews of the potential mechanisms behind the myriad of circadian and sleep abnormalities observed in schizophrenia and psychosis. We present evidence of sleep playing an important role in psychosis predominantly mediated by dopaminergic pathways. A synthesis of both human and animal experimental work suggests that the interplay between sleep and dopamine is important in the generation and maintenance of psychosis. In particular, both animal and human data point to sleep disruption increasing dopamine release and sensitivity. Furthermore, elevated dopamine levels disrupt sleep and circadian rhythms. The synthesis of knowledge suggests that circadian rhythms, dopamine dysregulation, and psychosis are intricately linked. This suggests that treatment of circadian disturbance may be a useful target in improving the lives and symptoms of patients with schizophrenia."
"Indoor non-air-conditioned environments widely exist in the summer high temperature weather. The work efficiency of the people who stay indoors for a long time is seriously affected by the indoor high temperature. In this paper, the changes of the circadian rhythms of work efficiency in indoor high temperature environments were studied. Ten healthy subjects (five males and five females) were selected in the experiments randomly. In each experiment day, the maximum hourly outdoor temperature was selected as 28 degrees C, 32 degrees C, 36 degrees C, and 38 degrees C, respectively, to determine the experiment conditions. In each experiment condition, subjects' response time, accuracy rate, grip strength, work willingness, and physiological parameters were monitored for 24 consecutive hours. Meanwhile, the hourly outdoor temperatures of the experiment day were accessed from the weather report during the experiment. Then the cosinor method and statistical method were adopted. The results indicated that the response time, grip strength, and work willingness followed circadian rhythms. However, the accuracy rates of the Stroop color-word test (SCWT) and numeral inspection task (NIT) did not show an obvious circadian rhythm. The effects of high temperature on the circadian rhythms of grip strength and work willingness were mainly reflected in the decreases of the median and amplitude. The effects on the response time were mainly reflected in the decrease of the median. In addition, forehead temperature showed a significant negative correlation to response time, and it could be considered as a predictor to assess the level of work efficiency. This study gives an alternative method to replace direct measurement of the ability indices at work site and provides basic data of 24 consecutive hours, for showing changes in human work efficiency. It could be helpful to predict the low performance in advance to reduce occupational accidents."
"Many immune parameters show circadian rhythms during the 24-hour day in mammals. The most striking circadian oscillation is the number of circulating immune cells that display an opposite rhythm between humans and mice. The physiological roles and mechanisms of circadian variations in mouse leukocytes are well studied, whereas for humans they remain unclear because of the lack of a proper model. In this study, we found that consistent with their natural host species, mouse and human circulating leukocytes exhibited opposite circadian oscillations in humanized mice. This cyclic pattern of trafficking correlated well with the diurnal expression levels of C-X-C chemokine receptor 4, which were controlled by the intracellular hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha/aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like heterodimer. Furthermore, we also discovered that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases/mitogen-activated 2 had opposite effects between mice and humans in generating intracellular reactive oxygen species, which subsequently regulated HIF-1alpha expression. In conclusion, we propose humanized mice as a robust model for human circadian studies and reveal insights on a novel molecular clock network in the human circadian rhythm."
"The earth rotates on its axis around the sun, creating a day and night cycle, that caused the development of circadian rhythms. The circadian rhythm is primarily entrained by light, which is detected by the retina. Retinal ganglion cells project to a part of the hypothalamus termed suprachiasmatic nucleus. Here, we find the master molecular clock, composed of a transcription-translation-loop at its core. The master clock indirectly influences the innate immune system via different biological systems. Also, the master clock controls the peripheral clocks, which are present in innate immune cells. Here, circadian rhythm proteins influence the response of immune cells to pathogens. Furthermore, the master clock influences our sleep-pattern, the most important restorative physiological function. In critically ill patients the circadian rhythm is substantially altered, supporting a dysfunctional innate immune response. This review discusses recent basic science findings on the interaction of the circadian rhythm and the innate immune system. Furthermore we give an outlook on potential future therapeutic strategies."
"INTRODUCTION: Disruptions in sleep and circadian rhythms are observed in individuals with bipolar disorders (BD), both during acute mood episodes and remission. Such abnormalities may relate to dysfunction of the molecular circadian clock and could offer a target for new drugs. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on clinical, actigraphic, biochemical and genetic biomarkers of BDs, as well as animal and cellular models, and highlights that sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances are closely linked to the susceptibility to BDs and vulnerability to mood relapses. As lithium is likely to act as a synchronizer and stabilizer of circadian rhythms, we will review pharmacogenetic studies testing circadian gene polymorphisms and prophylactic response to lithium. Interventions such as sleep deprivation, light therapy and psychological therapies may also target sleep and circadian disruptions in BDs efficiently for treatment and prevention of bipolar depression. EXPERT OPINION: We suggest that future research should clarify the associations between sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances and alterations of the molecular clock in order to identify critical targets within the circadian pathway. The investigation of such targets using human cellular models or animal models combined with 'omics' approaches are crucial steps for new drug development."
"INTRODUCTION: Chronobiology studies the phenomenon of rhythmicity in living organisms. The circadian rhythms are genetically determined and regulated by external synchronizers (the daylight cycle). Several biological processes involved in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs are subjected to circadian variations. Chronopharmacology studies how biological rhythms influence pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and toxicity, and determines whether time-of-day administration modifies the pharmacological characteristics of the drug. Chronotherapy applies chronopharmacological studies to clinical treatments, determining the best biological time for dosing: when the beneficial effects are maximal and the incidence and/or intensity of related side effects and toxicity are minimal. Most water-soluble drugs or drug metabolites are eliminated by urine through the kidney. The rate of drug clearance in the urine depends on several intrinsic variables related to renal function including renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, the ability of the kidney to reabsorb or to secrete drugs, urine flow, and urine pH, which influences the degree of urine acidification. Curiously, all these variables present a circadian behavior in different mammalian models. CONCLUSION: The circadian rhythms have influence in the renal physiology, pathophysiology, and pharmacology, and these data should be taken into account in clinical nephrology practice."
"Circadian clocks are autonomous oscillators driving daily rhythms in physiology and behavior. In mammals, a network of coupled neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is entrained to environmental light-dark cycles and orchestrates the timing of peripheral organs. In each neuron, transcriptional feedbacks generate noisy oscillations. Coupling mediated by neuropeptides such as VIP and AVP lends precision and robustness to circadian rhythms. The detailed coupling mechanisms between SCN neurons are debated. We analyze organotypic SCN slices from neonatal and adult mice in wild-type and multiple knockout conditions. Different degrees of rhythmicity are quantified by pixel-level analysis of bioluminescence data. We use empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) to characterize spatio-temporal patterns. Simulations of coupled stochastic single cell oscillators can reproduce the diversity of observed patterns. Our combination of data analysis and modeling provides deeper insight into the enormous complexity of the data: (1) Neonatal slices are typically stronger oscillators than adult slices pointing to developmental changes of coupling. (2) Wild-type slices are completely synchronized and exhibit specific spatio-temporal patterns of phases. (3) Some slices of Cry double knockouts obey impaired synchrony that can lead to co-existing rhythms (""splitting""). (4) The loss of VIP-coupling leads to desynchronized rhythms with few residual local clusters. Additional information was extracted from co-culturing slices with rhythmic neonatal wild-type SCNs. These co-culturing experiments were simulated using external forcing terms representing VIP and AVP signaling. The rescue of rhythmicity via co-culturing lead to surprising results, since a cocktail of AVP-antagonists improved synchrony. Our modeling suggests that these counter-intuitive observations are pointing to an antagonistic action of VIP and AVP coupling. Our systematic theoretical and experimental study shows that dual coupling mechanisms can explain the astonishing complexity of spatio-temporal patterns in SCN slices."
"Accumulating evidence suggests that the olfactory bulbs (OBs) function as an independent circadian system regulating daily rhythms in olfactory performance. However, the cells and signals in the olfactory system that generate and coordinate these circadian rhythms are unknown. Using real-time imaging of gene expression, we found that the isolated olfactory epithelium and OB, but not the piriform cortex, express similar, sustained circadian rhythms in PERIOD2 (PER2). In vivo, PER2 expression in the OB of mice is circadian, approximately doubling with a peak around subjective dusk. Furthermore, mice exhibit circadian rhythms in odor detection performance with a peak at approximately subjective dusk. We also found that circadian rhythms in gene expression and odor detection performance require vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) or its receptor VPAC2R. VIP is expressed, in a circadian manner, in interneurons in the external plexiform and periglomerular layers, whereas VPAC2R is expressed in mitral and external tufted cells in the OB. Together, these results indicate that VIP signaling modulates the output from the OB to maintain circadian rhythms in the mammalian olfactory system."
"Organisms are adapted to the relentless cycles of day and night, because they evolved timekeeping systems called circadian clocks, which regulate biological activities with ~24-hour rhythms. The clock of cyanobacteria is driven by a three-protein oscillator composed of KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, which together generate a circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation. We show that KaiB flips between two distinct three-dimensional folds, and its rare transition to an active state provides a time delay that is required to match the timing of the oscillator to that of Earth's rotation. Once KaiB switches folds, it binds phosphorylated KaiC and captures KaiA, which initiates a phase transition of the circadian cycle, and it regulates components of the clock-output pathway, which provides the link that joins the timekeeping and signaling functions of the oscillator."
"BACKGROUND: Growing evidence supports a central role for the circadian system in alcohol use disorders, but few studies have examined this relationship during adolescence. In mammals, circadian rhythms are regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus, a biological clock whose timing is synchronized (reset) to the environment primarily by light (photic) input. Alcohol (ethanol [EtOH]) disrupts circadian timing in part by attenuating photic phase-resetting responses in adult rodents. However, circadian rhythms change throughout life and it is not yet known whether EtOH has similar effects on circadian regulation during adolescence. METHODS: General circadian locomotor activity was monitored in male C57BL6/J mice beginning in adolescence (P27) or adulthood (P61) in a 12-hour light, 12-hour dark photocycle for ~2 weeks to establish baseline circadian activity measures. On the day of the experiment, mice received an acute injection of EtOH (1.5 g/kg, i.p.) or equal volume saline 15 minutes prior to a 30-minute light pulse at Zeitgeber Time 14 (2 hours into the dark phase) and then were released into constant darkness (DD) for ~2 weeks to assess phase-resetting responses. Control mice of each age-group received injections but no light pulse prior to DD. RESULTS: While adults showed the expected decrease in photic phase-delays induced by acute EtOH, this effect was absent in adolescent mice. Adolescents also showed baseline differences in circadian rhythmicity compared to adults, including advanced photocycle entrainment, larger photic phase-delays, a shorter free-running (endogenous) circadian period, and greater circadian rhythm amplitude. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results indicate that adolescent mice are less sensitive to the effect of EtOH on circadian photic phase-resetting and that their daily activity rhythms are markedly different than those of adults."
"An association between circadian rhythms and mood regulation is well established, and disturbed circadian clocks are believed to contribute to the development of mood disorders, including major depressive disorder. The circadian system is coordinated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master pacemaker in the hypothalamus that receives light input from the retina and synchronizes circadian oscillators in other brain regions and peripheral tissues. Lacking the tight neuronal network that couples single-cell oscillators in the SCN, circadian clocks outside the SCN may be less stable and more susceptible to disturbances, for example by clock gene mutations or uncontrollable stress. However, non-SCN circadian clocks have not been studied extensively in rodent models of mood disorders. In the present study, it was hypothesized that disturbances of local circadian clocks in mood-regulating brain areas are associated with depression-like behaviour in mice. Using the learned helplessness procedure, depression-like behaviour was evoked in mice bearing the PER2::LUC circadian reporter, and then circadian rhythms of PER2 expression were examined in brain slices from these mice using luminometry and bioluminescence imaging. It was found that helplessness is associated with absence of circadian rhythms in the nucleus accumbens and the periaqueductal grey, two of the most critical brain regions within the reward circuit. The current study provides evidence that susceptibility of mice to depression-like behaviour is associated with disturbed local circadian clocks in a subset of mood-regulating brain areas, but the direction of causality remains to be determined."
"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises a group of chronic, immune system-mediated inflammatory diseases that primarily affect the gastrointestinal tract. The pathogenesis of the intestinal lesions in IBD remains elusive, but the inflammation process could be the result of dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immune systems induced by genetic and environmental factors. In recent years, research has demonstrated a connection between environmental stressors that can influence day-night variations, also called circadian rhythms, and digestive health. In this review, we focus on alterations in the complex interactions between intestinal mucosa, microbial factors, and the immune response in the intestinal milieu. We introduce the mechanisms that establish circadian rhythms and their regulation by the circadian rhythm genes. Evidence of circadian variation in the defense mechanisms of the intestine and its implication in the maintenance of a healthy microbiota are presented. Disruption of the circadian system can increase the activity of the gut immune system and the release of inflammatory factors. The link between chronodisruption or circadian rhythm impairment and IBD demonstrated by experimental and clinical studies illustrates the potential impact of circadian rhythms on treatment of these diseases. Future studies that investigate aspects of this subject are warranted."
"The cockroach, Leucophaea maderae, can be trained in an associative olfactory memory task by either classical or operant conditioning. When trained by classical conditioning, memory formation is regulated by a circadian clock, but once the memory is formed, it can be recalled at any circadian time. In contrast, when trained via operant conditioning, animals can learn the task at any circadian phase, but the ability to recall the long-term memory is tied to the phase of training. The optic lobes of the cockroach contain a circadian clock that drives circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, mating behavior, sensitivity of the compound eye to light, and the sensitivity of olfactory receptors in the antennae. To evaluate the role of the optic lobes in regulating learning and memory processes, the authors examined the effects of surgical ablation of the optic lobes on memory formation in classical conditioning and memory recall following operant conditioning. The effect of optic lobe ablation was to ""rescue"" the deficit in memory acquisition at a time the animals normally cannot learn and ""rescue"" the animal's ability to recall a memory formed by operant conditioning at a phase where memory was not normally expressed. The results suggested that the optic lobe pacemaker regulates these processes through inhibition at ""inappropriate"" times of day. As a pharmacological test of this hypothesis, the authors showed that injections of fipronil, an antagonist of GABA and glutamate-activated chloride channels, had the same effects as optic lobe ablation on memory formation and recall. The data suggest that the optic lobes contain the circadian clock(s) that regulate learning and memory processes via inhibition of neural processes in the brain."
"Circadian rhythm alterations have been implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly those of sleep, addiction, anxiety, and mood. Circadian rhythms are known to be maintained by a set of classic clock genes that form complex mutual and self-regulatory loops. While many other genes showing rhythmic expression have been identified by genome-wide studies, their roles in circadian regulation remain largely unknown. In attempts to directly connect circadian rhythms with neuropsychiatric disorders, genetic studies have identified gene mutations associated with several rare sleep disorders or sleep-related traits. Other than that, genetic studies of circadian genes in psychiatric disorders have had limited success. As an important mediator of environmental factors and regulators of circadian rhythms, the epigenetic system may hold the key to the etiology or pathology of psychiatric disorders, their subtypes or endophenotypes. Epigenomic regulation of the circadian system and the related changes have not been thoroughly explored in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders. We argue for systematic investigation of the circadian system, particularly epigenetic regulation, and its involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders to improve our understanding of human behavior and disease etiology."
"Circadian rhythms (Nobel prize for Medicine 2017) regulate, under action of biological clocks located both at the level of central nervous system and inside peripheral cells, several daily activities, embracing sleep, feeding times, energy metabolism, endocrine and immune functions with related pathological conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In RA the circadian rhythms impact on cellular functions, involving night synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, cell migration to inflamed tissues, phagocytosis, proliferative cell response and all are peaking at late night. In chronic inflammatory conditions such as RA, the amplitude of the circadian rhythm of the anti-inflammatory endogenous cortisol availability is not increased as expected and requested, which indicate a reduced night cortisol secretion under the adrenal chronic stress induced by the disease. Therefore, the prevention/treatment of the immune cell night hyperactivity, with related flare of cytokine synthesis and morning RA clinical symptoms, has been shown more effective when the availability of the exogenous glucocorticoids is obtained in the middle of the night (night release). The impressive positive results observed in RA patients treated with modified-night release prednisone with a low-dose chronotherapy, seem applicable even for other agents such as conventional NSAIDs and DMARDs, including the positive experimental and clinical results obtained by the night time daily administration of methotrexate. Interestingly, a very recent study showed that methotrexate upregulates important cell circadian genes, resulting in induction of apoptosis in synovial fibroblasts. The link between the circadian rhythms of the disease and the chronotherapy of RA is promising."
"The circadian clock is a set of regulatory steps that oscillate with a period of approximately 24 hours influencing many biological processes. These oscillations are robust to external stresses, and in the case of genotoxic stress (i.e. DNA damage), the circadian clock responds through phase shifting with primarily phase advancements. The effect of DNA damage on the circadian clock and the mechanism through which this effect operates remains to be thoroughly investigated. Here we build an in silico model to examine damage-induced circadian phase shifts by investigating a possible mechanism linking circadian rhythms to metabolism. The proposed model involves two DNA damage response proteins, SIRT1 and PARP1, that are each consumers of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), a metabolite involved in oxidation-reduction reactions and in ATP synthesis. This model builds on two key findings: 1) that SIRT1 (a protein deacetylase) is involved in both the positive (i.e. transcriptional activation) and negative (i.e. transcriptional repression) arms of the circadian regulation and 2) that PARP1 is a major consumer of NAD during the DNA damage response. In our simulations, we observe that increased PARP1 activity may be able to trigger SIRT1-induced circadian phase advancements by decreasing SIRT1 activity through competition for NAD supplies. We show how this competitive inhibition may operate through protein acetylation in conjunction with phosphorylation, consistent with reported observations. These findings suggest a possible mechanism through which multiple perturbations, each dominant during different points of the circadian cycle, may result in the phase advancement of the circadian clock seen during DNA damage."
"The circadian clock is a molecular timekeeper that matches endogenous rhythms in diverse traits with 24-h cycles in the external environment. Although a lack of clock resonance to the environment is detrimental to performance, clock phenotypes in wild populations nevertheless deviate substantially from the predicted optimal cycle length of 24 h, and significant genetic variation exists for circadian parameters. Here, we describe covariation between 2 traits considered to reflect adaptation to different aspects of temporal environmental heterogeneity, circadian rhythms (adaptation to daily environmental cycles) and flowering time (adaptation to seasonal cycles), in a Rocky Mountain population of the mustard Boechera stricta, a North American relative of Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that 18 families that differ in circadian period in leaf movement by 3.5 h expressed genetic diversity in first-year growth, reproductive phenology, vegetative size at reproduction, and starch concentration following vernalization. The families exhibited a large (~90-day) range in mean flowering time, even though the spatial scale of population sampling covered only a few hundred meters. Circadian period covaried with other traits such that longer-period families flowered earlier and at a larger size, a trait combination predicted to yield a fitness benefit in the wild. Circadian clock research in model systems has previously shown that mutations in clock genes influence phenology. Our results widen the scope of this research by illustrating a link between naturally segregating clock variation and reproductive phenology among wild genotypes, suggesting that the causes of genetic diversity in the clock lie partly in adaptation to seasonal environmental heterogeneity."
"Almost all the functions of a living organism have circadian oscillations. Disturbance of circadian rhythms can be either a reason or a consequence of a number of diseases. The article describes data on relationship of circadian rhythm and clock genes disturbances with type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disease development in humans and animals."
"PURPOSE: Data regarding circadian rhythm in the onset of spontaneous preterm premature rupture of membranes (PROM) and placental abruption (PA) cases are conflicting. We modeled the time of onset of preterm PROM and PA cases and examined if the circadian profiles varied based on the gestational age at delivery. METHODS: We used parametric and nonparametric methods, including trigonometric regression in the framework of generalized linear models, to test the presence of circadian rhythms in the time of onset of preterm PROM and PA cases among 395 women who delivered a singleton between 2009 and 2010 in Lima, Peru. RESULTS: We found a diurnal circadian pattern, with a morning peak at 07:32 AM (95% confidence interval, 05:46 AM-09:18 AM) among moderate preterm PROM cases (P value < .001), and some evidence of a diurnal circadian periodicity among PA cases in term infants (P value = .067). However, we did not find evidence of circadian rhythms in the time of onset of extremely or very preterm PROM (P value = .259) and preterm PA (P value = .224). CONCLUSIONS: The circadian rhythms of the time of onset of preterm PROM and PA cases varied based on gestational weeks at delivery. Although circadian rhythms were presented among moderate preterm PROM and term PA cases, there was no evidence of circadian rhythms among preterm PA and very or extremely preterm PROM cases, underlying other mechanisms associated with the time of onset."
"DNA sequence information alone cannot account for the immense variability between chromosomal alleles within diverse cell types in the brain, whether these differences are observed across time, cell type, or parental origin. The complex control and maintenance of gene expression and modulation are regulated by a multitude of molecular and cellular mechanisms that layer on top of the genetic code. The integration of genetic and environmental signals required for regulating brain development and function is achieved in part by a dynamic epigenetic landscape that includes DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs. These epigenetic mechanisms establish and maintain core biological processes, including genomic imprinting and entrainment of circadian rhythms. This chapter will focus on how the epigenetic layers of DNA methylation and long, noncoding RNAs interact with circadian rhythms at specific imprinted chromosomal loci associated with the human neurodevelopmental disorders Prader-Willi, Angelman, Kagami-Ogata, and Temple syndromes."
"Cryptochrome (Cry) 1 and Cry2 are regarded as critical components for circadian rhythm generation in mammals. Nevertheless, cultured suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of neonatal Cry double deficient (Cry1(-/-)/Cry2(-/-)) mice exhibit circadian rhythms that damp out in several cycles. Here, by combining bioluminescence imaging of Per1-luc and PER2::LUC with multielectrode recording, we show developmental changes in SCN circadian rhythms in Cry1(-/-)/Cry2(-/-) mice. At the tissue level, circadian rhythms are found in neonatal but not in adult SCN, whereas at the cellular level, rhythms are detected in both SCN. Cellular circadian rhythms are synchronized in neonates, but not in adults, indicating a loss of rhythm synchrony in the course of development. Synchronized circadian rhythms in adult Cry1(-/-)/Cry2(-/-) SCN are restored by coculture of neonatal, but not of juvenile, SCN. These findings indicate that CRY1 and CRY2 are necessary for the development of intercellular networks that subserve coherent rhythm expression in adult SCN."
"The biological clocks of the circadian timing system coordinate cellular and physiological processes and synchronizes these with daily cycles, feeding patterns also regulates circadian clocks. The clock genes and adipocytokines show circadian rhythmicity. Dysfunction of these genes are involved in the alteration of these adipokines during the development of obesity. Food availability promotes the stimuli associated with food intake which is a circadian oscillator outside of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Its circadian rhythm is arranged with the predictable daily mealtimes. Food anticipatory activity is mediated by a self-sustained circadian timing and its principal component is food entrained oscillator. However, the hypothalamus has a crucial role in the regulation of energy balance rather than food intake. Fatty acids or their metabolites can modulate neuronal activity by brain nutrient-sensing neurons involved in the regulation of energy and glucose homeostasis. The timing of three-meal schedules indicates close association with the plasma levels of insulin and preceding food availability. Desynchronization between the central and peripheral clocks by altered timing of food intake and diet composition can lead to uncoupling of peripheral clocks from the central pacemaker and to the development of metabolic disorders. Metabolic dysfunction is associated with circadian disturbances at both central and peripheral levels and, eventual disruption of circadian clock functioning can lead to obesity. While CLOCK expression levels are increased with high fat diet-induced obesity, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha increases the transcriptional level of brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (BMAL1) in obese subjects. Consequently, disruption of clock genes results in dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and obesity. Modifying the time of feeding alone can greatly affect body weight. Changes in the circadian clock are associated with temporal alterations in feeding behavior and increased weight gain. Thus, shift work is associated with increased risk for obesity, diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases as a result of unusual eating time and disruption of circadian rhythm."
"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the presence of a circadian body temperature rhythm and behaviorally assessed consciousness levels in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC; i.e., vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome or minimally conscious state). METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we investigated the presence of circadian temperature rhythms across 6 to 7 days using external skin temperature sensors in 18 patients with DOC. Beyond this, we examined the relationship between behaviorally assessed consciousness levels and circadian rhythmicity. RESULTS: Analyses with Lomb-Scargle periodograms revealed significant circadian rhythmicity in all patients (range 23.5-26.3 hours). We found that especially scores on the arousal subscale of the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised were closely linked to the integrity of circadian variations in body temperature. Finally, we piloted whether bright light stimulation could boost circadian rhythmicity and found positive evidence in 2 out of 8 patients. CONCLUSION: The study provides evidence for an association between circadian body temperature rhythms and arousal as a necessary precondition for consciousness. Our findings also make a case for circadian rhythms as a target for treatment as well as the application of diagnostic and therapeutic means at times when cognitive performance is expected to peak."
"BACKGROUND: The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the mammalian hypothalamus contains the master circadian clock of the body and an unusually large number of cells expressing stem cell-related proteins. These seemingly undifferentiated cells may serve in entrainment of the SCN circadian clock to light cycles or allow it to undergo neural plasticity important for modifying its rhythmic output signals. These cells may also proliferate and differentiate into neurons or glia in response to episodic stimuli or developmental events requiring alterations in the SCN's control of physiology and behavior. PROBLEM: To characterize expression of stem cell related proteins in the SCN and the effects of stem-like cells on circadian rhythms. METHODS: Explant cultures of mouse SCN were maintained in medium designed to promote survival and growth of stem cells but not neuronal cells. Several stem cell marker proteins including SRY-box containing gene 2 (SOX2), nestin, vimentin, octamer-binding protein 4 (OCT4), and Musashi RNA-binding protein 2 (MSI2) were identified by immunocytochemistry in histological sections from adult mouse SCN and in cultures of microdissected SCN. A bioinformatics analysis located potential SCN targets of MSI2 and related RNA-binding proteins. RESULTS: Cells expressing stem cell markers proliferated in culture. Immunostained brain sections and bioinformatics supported the view that MSI2 regulates immature properties of SCN neurons, potentially providing flexibility in SCN neural circuits. Explant cultures had ongoing mitotic activity, indicated by proliferating-cell nuclear antigen, and extensive cell loss shown by propidium iodide staining. Cells positive for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) that are highly enriched in the SCN were diminished in explant cultures. Despite neuronal cell loss, tissue remained viable for over 7 weeks in culture, as shown by bioluminescence imaging of explants prepared from SCN of Per1::luc transgenic mice. The circadian rhythm in SCN gene expression persisted in brain slice cultures in stem cell medium. Prominent, widespread expression of RNA-binding protein MSI2 supported the importance of posttranscriptional regulation in SCN functions and provided further evidence of stem-like cells. CONCLUSION: The results show that the SCN retains properties of immature neurons and these properties persist in culture conditions suitable for stem cells, where the SCN stem-like cells also proliferate. These properties may allow adaptive circadian rhythm adjustments. Further exploration should examine stem-like cells of the SCN in vivo, how they may affect circadian rhythms, and whether MSI2 serves as a master regulator of SCN stem-like properties."
"Daily rhythms for hormonal traits are likely widespread and important aspects of organismal (e.g., life history) adaptation. Yet they remain substantially understudied, especially with respect to variable rhythms within species. The cricket, Gryllus firmus, exhibits a genetically polymorphic circadian rhythm for the blood titer of the key hormone, juvenile hormone (JH). Gryllus firmus is also wing-polymorphic, consisting of a dispersing morph that delays reproduction and a flightless morph with substantially enhanced egg production. JH circadian phenotype strongly covaries with morph type: The blood JH titer is strongly rhythmic in multiple populations artificially-selected for the dispersing morph (LW(f) = long wings with functional flight muscles) and is essentially arrhythmic in populations selected for the SW (short-winged) morph. Association between JH titer cycle and LW(f) morph is also found in natural populations of G. firmus and in several related species in the field. This is one of the very few studies of endocrine titer variation in natural populations of an insect. The morph-specific cycle is underlain by a circadian rhythm in hormone biosynthesis, which in turn is underlain by a rhythm in a brain neuropeptide regulator of JH biosynthesis. The morph-specific JH titer circadian cycle is also strongly correlated with a morph-specific daily rhythm in global gene expression. This is currently the only example of a genetically-variable hormone circadian rhythm in both the laboratory and field that is strongly associated with an ecologically important polymorphism. The extensive information on the underlying causes of the morph-specific JH titer rhythm, coupled with the strong association between the JH circadian rhythm and wing polymorphism makes this system in G. firmus an exceptional experimental model to investigate the mechanisms underlying circadian hormonal adaptations. Genetic polymorphism for the JH titer circadian rhythm in G. firmus is discussed in context of circadian rhythms for endocrine traits reported for vertebrates and insects. Consequences of the failure to identify endocrine circadian rhythms on the accuracy of estimation of quantitative-genetic parameters, such as heritability and correlations between hormonal and fitness-related traits, are also discussed."
"Numerous aspects of mammalian physiology exhibit cyclic daily patterns known as circadian rhythms. However, studies in aged humans and animals indicate that these physiological rhythms are not consistent throughout the life span. The simultaneous development of disrupted circadian rhythms and age-related impairments suggests a shared mechanism, which may be amenable to therapeutic intervention. Recently, the endocannabinoid system has emerged as a complex signaling network, which regulates numerous aspects of circadian physiology relevant to the neurobiology of aging. Agonists of cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1) have consistently been shown to decrease neuronal activity, core body temperature, locomotion, and cognitive function. Paradoxically, several lines of evidence now suggest that very low doses of cannabinoids are beneficial in advanced age. One potential explanation for this phenomenon is that these drugs exhibit hormesis-a biphasic dose-response wherein low doses produce the opposite effects of higher doses. Therefore, it is important to determine the dose-, age-, and time-dependent effects of these substances on the regulation of circadian rhythms and other processes dysregulated in aging. This review highlights 3 fields-biological aging, circadian rhythms, and endocannabinoid signaling-to critically assess the therapeutic potential of endocannabinoid modulation in aged individuals. If the hormetic properties of exogenous cannabinoids are confirmed, we conclude that precise administration of these compounds may bidirectionally entrain central and peripheral circadian clocks and benefit multiple aspects of aging physiology."
"There is a growing recognition that the coordinated timing of behavioral, physiologic, and metabolic circadian rhythms is a requirement for a healthy body and mind. In mammals, the primary circadian oscillator is the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is responsible for circadian coordination throughout the organism. Temporal homeostasis is recognized as a complex interplay between rhythmic clock gene expression in brain regions outside the SCN and in peripheral organs. Abnormalities in this intricate circadian orchestration may alter sleep patterns and contribute to the pathophysiology of affective disorders."
"Systolic (S) and diastolic (D) blood pressures (BP) [SBP and DBP] are circadian rhythmic with period (tau) in healthy persons assumed to be maintained at 24.0h. We tested this assumption in a sample of 30 healthy career (mean >12 yrs) 30-to-46 yr-old male Caucasian French firefighters (FFs) categorized into three groups according to work schedule and duties: Group A - 12 FFs working 12h day, 12h night, and occasionally 24h shifts and whose primary duties are firefighting plus paramedical and road rescue services; Group B - 9 FFs working mostly 12h day and 12h night shifts and whose duties are answering incoming emergency calls and coordinating service vehicle dispatch from fire stations with Group A personnel; Group C - 9 day shift (09:00-17:00h) FFs charged with administrative tasks. SBP and DBP, both in winter and in summer studies of the same FFs, were sampled by ambulatory BP monitoring every 1h between 06:00-23:00h and every 2h between 23:01-05:59h, respectively, their approximate off-duty wake and sleep spans, for 7 consecutive days. Activity (wrist actigraphy) was also sampled at 1-min intervals. Prominent tau of each variable was derived by a power spectrum program written for unequal-interval time series data, and between-group differences in incidence of tau not equal24h of FFs were assessed by chi square test. Circadian rhythm disruption (tau not equal24h) of either the SBP or DBP rhythm occurred almost exclusively in night and 24h shift FFs of Group A and B, but almost never in day shift FFs of Group C, and it was not associated with altered tau from 24.0h of the circadian activity rhythm. In summer, occurrence of tau not equal24 for FFs of Group A and B differed from that for FFs of Group C in SBP (p=0.042) and DBP (p=0.015); no such differences were found in winter (p>0.10). Overall, manifestation of prominent tau not equal24h of SBP or DBP time series was greater in summer than winter, 27.6% versus 16.7%, when workload of Group B FFs, i.e. number of incoming emergency telephone calls, and of Group A FFs, i.e. number of dispatches for provision of emergency services, was, respectively, two and fourfold greater and number of 12h night shifts worked by Group B FFs and number of 24h shifts worked by Group A FFs was, respectively, 92% and 25% greater. FFs of the three groups exhibited no winter-summer difference in tau not equal24h of SBP or SDP; however, tau not equal24h of DBP in Group B FFs was more frequent in summer than winter (p=0.046). Sleep/wake cycle disruption, sleep deprivation, emotional and physical stress, artificial light-at-night, and altered nutrient timings are hypothesized causes of tau not equal24h for BP rhythms of affected Groups A and B FFs, but with unknown future health effects."
"Serotonin plays an important role in the central regulation of circadian clock function. Serotonin levels are generally higher in the brain during periods of high activity, and these periods are in turn heavily regulated by the circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. However, the role of serotonin as a regulator of circadian rhythms elsewhere in the brain has not been extensively examined. In this study, we examined circadian rhythms of clock gene expression in the cerebellum in mice lacking the Pet-1 transcription factor, which results in a developed brain that is deficient in serotonin neurons. If serotonin helps to synchronize rhythms in brain regions other than the suprachiasmatic nucleus, we would expect to see differences in clock gene expression in these serotonin deficient mice. We found minor differences in the expression of Per1 and Per2 in the knockout mice as compared to wild type, but these differences were small and of questionable functional importance. We also measured the response of cerebellar clocks to injections of the serotonin agonist 8-OH-DPAT during the early part of the night. No effect on clock genes was observed, though the immediate-early gene Fos showed increased expression in wild type mice but not the knockouts. These results suggest that serotonin is not an important mediator of circadian rhythms in the cerebellum in a way that parallels its regulation of the circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus."
"Based on genetic models with mutation or deletion of core clock genes, circadian disruption has been implicated in the pathophysiology of metabolic disorders. Thus, we examined whether circadian desynchronization in response to shift work-type schedules is sufficient to compromise metabolic homeostasis and whether inflammatory mediators provide a key link in the mechanism by which alterations of circadian timekeeping contribute to diet-induced metabolic dysregulation. In high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, exposure to chronic shifts of the light-dark cycle (12 h advance every 5 d): 1) disrupts photoentrainment of circadian behavior and modulates the period of spleen and macrophage clock gene rhythms; 2) potentiates HFD-induced adipose tissue infiltration and activation of proinflammatory M1 macrophages; 3) amplifies macrophage proinflammatory cytokine expression in adipose tissue and bone marrow-derived macrophages; and 4) exacerbates diet-induced increases in body weight, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance in the absence of changes in total daily food intake. Thus, complete disruption of circadian rhythmicity or clock gene function as transcription factors is not requisite to the link between circadian and metabolic phenotypes. These findings suggest that macrophage proinflammatory activation and inflammatory signaling are key processes in the physiologic cascade by which dysregulation of circadian rhythmicity exacerbates diet-induced systemic insulin resistance and glucose intolerance.-Kim, S.-M., Neuendorff, N., Alaniz, R. C., Sun, Y., Chapkin, R. S., Earnest, D. J. Shift work cycle-induced alterations of circadian rhythms potentiate the effects of high-fat diet on inflammation and metabolism."
"Circadian clocks in mammals function in most organs and tissues throughout the body. Various renal functions such as the glomerular filtration and excretion of electrolytes exhibit circadian rhythms. Although it has been reported that the expression of the clock genes composing molecular oscillators show apparent daily rhythms in rodent kidneys, functional variations of regional clocks are not yet fully understood. In this study, using macroscopic bioluminescence imaging method of the PER2::Luciferase knock-in mouse kidney, we reveal that strong and robust circadian clock oscillation is observed in the medulla. In addition, the osmotic pressure in the inner medulla shows apparent daily fluctuation, but not in the cortex. Quantitative-PCR analysis of the genes contributing to the generation of high osmotic pressure or the water re-absorption in the inner medulla, such as vasopressin receptors (V1aR, V2R), urea transporter (UT-A2) and water channel (Aqp2) show diurnal variations as well as clock genes. Deficiency of an essential clock gene Bmal1 impairs day-night variations of osmotic pressure gradient in the inner medulla, suggesting that circadian clocks in the medulla part of the kidney may regulate the circadian rhythm of cortico-medullary osmotic pressure gradient, and may contribute physiological day-night rhythm of urination."
"OBJECTIVES: Incremental markings in dental enamel suggest that the circadian clock may influence the molecular underpinnings orchestrating enamel formation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) oscillate in a circadian pattern during tooth and enamel development. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Comparative gene and miRNA expression profiling of the first mandibular molar tooth germ isolated at different time-points during the light and night period was performed using microarrays and validated using real-time RT-PCR. Bioinformatic analysis was carried out using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), and TargetScan software was used in order to identify computationally predicted miRNA-mRNA target relationships. RESULTS: In total, 439 genes and 32 miRNAs exhibited significantly different (p < 0.05) levels of expression in the light phase compared with the night phase tooth germs. Genes involved in enamel formation, i.e. Amelx, Ambn, Amtn, and Odam, oscillated in a circadian pattern. Furthermore, the circadian clock genes, in particular Clock and Bmal1, oscillated in mouse molar tooth germ during 24-h intervals. The expression of Clock and Bmal1 was inversely correlated with the expression of miR-182 and miR-141, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MiRNAs, including miR-182 and miR-141, are involved in the control of peripheral circadian rhythms in the developing tooth by regulating the expression of genes coding for circadian transcription factors such as CLOCK and BMAL1. Regulation of circadian rhythms may be important for enamel phenotype, and the morphology of dental enamel may vary between individuals due to differences in circadian profiles."
"The large repertoire of circadian rhythms in diverse organisms depends on oscillating central clock genes, input pathways for entrainment, and output pathways for controlling rhythmic behaviors. Stress-activated p38 MAP Kinases (p38K), although sparsely investigated in this context, show circadian rhythmicity in mammalian brains and are considered part of the circadian output machinery in Neurospora. We find that Drosophila p38Kb is expressed in clock neurons, and mutants in p38Kb either are arrhythmic or have a longer free-running periodicity, especially as they age. Paradoxically, similar phenotypes are observed through either transgenic inhibition or activation of p38Kb in clock neurons, suggesting a requirement for optimal p38Kb function for normal free-running circadian rhythms. We also find that p38Kb genetically interacts with multiple downstream targets to regulate circadian locomotor rhythms. More specifically, p38Kb interacts with the period gene to regulate period length and the strength of rhythmicity. In addition, we show that p38Kb suppresses the arrhythmic behavior associated with inhibition of a second p38Kb target, the transcription factor Mef2. Finally, we find that manipulating p38K signaling in free-running conditions alters the expression of another downstream target, MNK/Lk6, which has been shown to cycle with the clock and to play a role in regulating circadian rhythms. These data suggest that p38Kb may affect circadian locomotor rhythms through the regulation of multiple downstream pathways."
"In humans, insulin sensitivity varies according to time of day, with decreased values in the evening and at night. Mechanisms responsible for the diurnal variation in insulin sensitivity are unclear. We investigated whether human adipose tissue (AT) expresses intrinsic circadian rhythms in insulin sensitivity that could contribute to this phenomenon. Subcutaneous and visceral AT biopsies were obtained from extremely obese participants (body mass index, 41.8 +/- 6.3 kg/m(2); 46 +/- 11 y) during gastric-bypass surgery. To assess the rhythm in insulin signaling, AKT phosphorylation was determined every 4 h over 24 h in vitro in response to different insulin concentrations (0, 1, 10, and 100 nM). Data revealed that subcutaneous AT exhibited robust circadian rhythms in insulin signaling (P < 0.00001). Insulin sensitivity reached its maximum (acrophase) around noon, being 54% higher than during midnight (P = 0.009). The amplitude of the rhythm was positively correlated with in vivo sleep duration (r = 0.53; P = 0.023) and negatively correlated with in vivo bedtime (r = -0.54; P = 0.020). No circadian rhythms were detected in visceral AT (P = 0.643). Here, we demonstrate the relevance of the time of the day for how sensitive AT is to the effects of insulin. Subcutaneous AT shows an endogenous circadian rhythm in insulin sensitivity that could provide an underlying mechanism for the daily rhythm in systemic insulin sensitivity.-Carrasco-Benso, M. P., Rivero-Gutierrez, B., Lopez-Minguez, J., Anzola, A., Diez-Noguera, A., Madrid, J. A., Lujan, J. A., Martinez-Augustin, O., Scheer, F. A. J. L., Garaulet, M. Human adipose tissue expresses intrinsic circadian rhythm in insulin sensitivity."
"The aim of this study was to investigate lithium and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP)-induced circadian rhythm disorder and their genome-wide effects in zebrafish. Zebrafish larvae were exposed to 250 ppm LiCl (n = 40) or 20 ppm 2,4-DCP. RNA was subsequently extracted and determined quantitatively. The mRNA levels of circadian clock-related genes, including clock1a, bmal1b, per2, and per1b, were determined. Microarray datasets were generated and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The mRNA levels of some upregulated and downregulated DEGs were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Finally, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was applied to determine the roles of the DEGs. The mRNA expression levels of circadian rhythm-related genes in the daily cycle were significantly affected after incubation of zebrafish with LiCl and 2,4-DCP. Many genes were differentially expressed during the light phase (97 h) and RT-PCR validation tests revealed that the expression patterns of DEGs were in accordance with those obtained by microarray analysis. GO functional enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs in LiCl- and 2,4-DCP-treated groups were associated with signal transduction and development. Collectively, our findings indicate that LiCl and 2,4-DCP could affect signal transduction pathways and immune response, thereby inducing circadian rhythm disorder."
"Circadian rhythms are known to regulate immune responses in healthy animals, but it is unclear whether they persist during acute illnesses where clock gene expression is disrupted by systemic inflammation. Here we use a genome-wide approach to investigate circadian gene and metabolite expression in the lungs of endotoxemic mice and find that novel cellular and molecular circadian rhythms are elicited in this setting. The endotoxin-specific circadian programme exhibits unique features, including a divergent group of rhythmic genes and metabolites compared with the basal state and a distinct periodicity and phase distribution. At the cellular level, endotoxin treatment also alters circadian rhythms of leukocyte counts within the lung in a bmal1-dependent manner, such that granulocytes rather than lymphocytes become the dominant oscillating cell type. Our results show that inflammation produces a complex re-organization of cellular and molecular circadian rhythms that are relevant to early events in lung injury."
"We previously created two PER2::LUCIFERASE (PER2::LUC) circadian reporter knockin mice that differ only in the Per2 3'-UTR region: Per2::Luc, which retains the endogenous Per2 3'-UTR and Per2::LucSV, where the endogenous Per2 3'-UTR was replaced by an SV40 late poly(A) signal. To delineate the in vivo functions of Per2 3'-UTR, we analyzed circadian rhythms of Per2::LucSV mice. Interestingly, Per2::LucSV mice displayed more than threefold stronger amplitude in bioluminescence rhythms than Per2::Luc mice, and also exhibited lengthened free-running periods ( approximately 24.0 h), greater phase delays following light pulse, and enhanced temperature compensation relative to Per2::Luc Analysis of the Per2 3'-UTR sequence revealed that miR-24, and to a lesser degree miR-30, suppressed PER2 protein translation, and the reversal of this inhibition in Per2::LucSV augmented PER2::LUC protein level and oscillatory amplitude. Interestingly, Bmal1 mRNA and protein oscillatory amplitude as well as CRY1 protein oscillation were increased in Per2::LucSV mice, suggesting rhythmic overexpression of PER2 enhances expression of Per2 and other core clock genes. Together, these studies provide important mechanistic insights into the regulatory roles of Per2 3'-UTR, miR-24, and PER2 in Per2 expression and core clock function."
"Numerous physiological processes of mammals, including bone metabolism, are regulated by the circadian clock system, which consists of a central regulator, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and the peripheral oscillators of the BMAL1/CLOCK-PERs/CRYs system. Various bone turnover markers and bone metabolism-regulating hormones such as melatonin and parathyroid hormone (PTH) display diurnal rhythmicity. According to previous research, disruption of the circadian clock due to shift work, sleep restriction, or clock gene knockout is associated with osteoporosis or other abnormal bone metabolism, showing the importance of the circadian clock system for maintaining homeostasis of bone metabolism. Moreover, common causes of osteoporosis, including postmenopausal status and aging, are associated with changes in the circadian clock. In our previous research, we found that agonism of the circadian regulators REV-ERBs inhibits osteoclast differentiation and ameliorates ovariectomy-induced bone loss in mice, suggesting that clock genes may be promising intervention targets for abnormal bone metabolism. Moreover, osteoporosis interventions at different time points can provide varying degrees of bone protection, showing the importance of accounting for circadian rhythms for optimal curative effects in clinical treatment of osteoporosis. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about circadian rhythms and bone metabolism."
"Circadian rhythms maintain a high level of homeostasis through internal feed-forward and -backward regulation by core molecules. In this study, we report the highly unusual peripheral circadian rhythm of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) induced by titanium-based biomaterials with complex surface modifications (Ti biomaterial) commonly used for dental and orthopedic implants. When cultured on Ti biomaterials, human BMSCs suppressed circadian PER1 expression patterns, while NPAS2 was uniquely upregulated. The Ti biomaterials, which reduced Per1 expression and upregulated Npas2, were further examined with BMSCs harvested from Per1::luc transgenic rats. Next, we addressed the regulatory relationship between Per1 and Npas2 using BMSCs from Npas2 knockout mice. The Npas2 knockout mutation did not rescue the Ti biomaterial-induced Per1 suppression and did not affect Per2, Per3, Bmal1 and Clock expression, suggesting that the Ti biomaterial-induced Npas2 overexpression was likely an independent phenomenon. Previously, vitamin D deficiency was reported to interfere with Ti biomaterial osseointegration. The present study demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation significantly increased Per1::luc expression in BMSCs, though the presence of Ti biomaterials only moderately affected the suppressed Per1::luc expression. Available in vivo microarray data from femurs exposed to Ti biomaterials in vitamin D-deficient rats were evaluated by weighted gene co-expression network analysis. A large co-expression network containing Npas2, Bmal1, and Vdr was observed to form with the Ti biomaterials, which was disintegrated by vitamin D deficiency. Thus, the aberrant BMSC peripheral circadian rhythm may be essential for the integration of Ti biomaterials into bone."
"OBJECTIVE: To study disturbances of sleep and circadian rhythms in patients with cardiovascular diseases taking into account the level of melatonin secretion and to optimize a complex approach to their treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included patients with cardiovascular diseases with- (n=121) and without (n=105) cerebrovascular diseases (CVD). All patients received melaxen in dose 3 mg daily 30-40 min before sleep. Examination of patients included assessment of neurological status, psychometric scales, the definition of circadian rhythm of the heart and blood pressure, determination of 6-SOMT in daily urine. RESULTS: Pathological changes in circadian rhythms affected sleep disturbances, emotional and cognitive disorders and were associated with a reduction in the level of 6-SOMT in the urine. These changes were most pronounced in patients with CVD and stroke. The inclusion of melaxen in the comprehensive regimen of treatment improved sleep, reduced mood disorders and normalized the circadian heart rate profile and blood pressure. CONCLUSION: The data obtained allowed to consider melaxen as an effective tool in the complex therapy of patients with CVD."
"Circadian rhythmicity is fundamental to human physiology, and is present even during fetal life in normal pregnancies. The impact of maternal endocrine disease on the fetal circadian rhythm is not well understood. The present study aimed to determine the fetal circadian rhythm in pregnancies complicated by pregestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM), compare it with a low-risk reference population, and identify the effects of maternal glycemic control and morning cortisol concentrations. Long-term fetal electrocardiogram recordings were made in 40 women with PGDM at 28 and 36 weeks of gestation. Two recordings were made in 18 of the women (45.0%) and one recording was made in 22 (55.0%). The mean fetal heart rate (fHR) and the fHR variation (root mean square of squared differences) were extracted in 1-min epochs, and circadian rhythmicity was detected by cosinor analysis. The study cohort was divided based on HbA1c levels and morning cortisol concentrations. Statistically, significant circadian rhythms in the fHR and the fHR variation were found in 45 (100%) and 44 (95.7%) of the 45 acceptable PGDM recordings, respectively. The rhythms were similar to those of the reference population. However, there was no statistically significant population-mean rhythm in the fHR among PGDM pregnancies at 36 weeks, indicating an increased interindividual variation. The group with higher HbA1c levels (>6.0%) had no significant population-mean fHR rhythm at 28 or 36 weeks, and no significant fHR-variation rhythm at 36 weeks. Similarly, the group with a lower morning cortisol concentration (</=8.8 microg/dl) had no significant population-mean fHR-variation rhythm at 28 and 36 weeks. These findings indicate that individual fetal rhythmicity is present in pregnancies complicated by PGDM. However, suboptimal maternal glycemic control and a lower maternal morning cortisol concentration are associated with a less-well-synchronized circadian system of the fetus."
"Preclinical Research Circadian rhythms are fundamental processes in all cells that coordinate a variety of cellular functions related to a specific time of the day. Disruption of circadian rhythms markedly impacts homeostasis. In this Commentary, we present data that disruption of circadian rhythm may lead to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative states. In this context, we further argue that there is an urgent need of developing new generations of compounds, chronobiotics, to modulate the molecular substrates of circadian timing system. Chronobiotics conceptually offer an effective way for restoration and protection from the consequences of the circadian disruption. We also briefly discuss whether dysfunctional circadian rhythms are a major driver of aging. Drug Dev Res 77 : 469-473, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
"The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the research regarding circadian rhythms in Alzheimer disease (AD). Furthermore, this paper explores the role of melatonin in the pathogenesis of AD and the limitation of trials addressing circadian rhythms disturbances in the AD population. A literature search using Medline with PubMed and Embase was carried out identifying papers focusing on circadian rhythms in AD. Sleep disorders and especially circadian rhythm disturbances are very common in the elderly population but definitely more pronounced in patients with AD. The lack of trials evaluating the management of circadian rhythms disorders in the elderly population and especially in AD should be considered of the utmost importance. Although there is a better understanding about the pathophysiology of AD and its relationship with circadian disorders, further studies in human models need to be conducted."
"OBJECTIVE: Efficient treatments to phase-advance human circadian rhythms are needed to attenuate circadian misalignment and the associated negative health outcomes that accompany early-morning shift work, early school start times, jet lag, and delayed sleep phase disorder. This study compared three morning bright-light exposure patterns from a single light box (to mimic home treatment) in combination with afternoon melatonin. METHODS: Fifty adults (27 males) aged 25.9 +/- 5.1 years participated. Sleep/dark was advanced 1 h/day for three treatment days. Participants took 0.5 mg of melatonin 5 h before the baseline bedtime on treatment day 1, and an hour earlier each treatment day. They were exposed to one of three bright-light (~5000 lux) patterns upon waking each morning: four 30-min exposures separated by 30 min of room light (2-h group), four 15-min exposures separated by 45 min of room light (1-h group), and one 30-min exposure (0.5-h group). Dim-light melatonin onsets (DLMOs) before and after treatment determined the phase advance. RESULTS: Compared to the 2-h group (phase shift = 2.4 +/- 0.8 h), smaller phase-advance shifts were seen in the 1-h (1.7 +/- 0.7 h) and 0.5-h (1.8 +/- 0.8 h) groups. The 2-h pattern produced the largest phase advance; however, the single 30-min bright-light exposure was as effective as 1 h of bright light spread over 3.25 h, and it produced 75% of the phase shift observed with 2 h of bright light. CONCLUSIONS: A 30-min morning bright-light exposure with afternoon melatonin is an efficient treatment to phase-advance human circadian rhythms."
"Circadian rhythms are fundamental to behavior and physiology of organisms. Flutolanil as a fungicide is toxic to zebrafish embryos. The aims of this study were to determine whether flutolanil would influence circadian rhythms of zebrafish and the mechanism involved. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to flutolanil (0, 0.125, 0.5 and 2mg/L) for 4 days. Here we report that flutolanil increased the melatonin levels of zebrafish. The mRNA levels of genes related to circadian rhythms were significantly altered. The clock level was significantly increased, but the content of cry1 showed no apparent changes. Moreover, our findings that the level of GH was significantly decreased were consistent with the abnormal development of zebrafish embryos. The expression levels of genes related to development, behavior and reproduction were significantly altered by flutolanil. These results indicate that flutolanil disturbed circadian rhythms of zebrafish primarily by affecting the positive elements, which were at least in partial responsible for abnormal development and behavior of zebrafish. And we speculate that flutolanil is toxic to zebrafish embryos at least in part via dysregulation of circadian rhythms involving clock."
"The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the site of the master circadian clock in mammals. The SCN neural network plays a critical role in expressing the tissue-level circadian rhythm. Previously, we demonstrated postnatal changes in the SCN network in mice, in which the clock gene products CRYPTOCHROMES (CRYs) are involved. Here, we show that vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) signaling is essential for the tissue-level circadian PER2::LUC rhythm in the neonatal SCN of CRY double-deficient mice (Cry1,2 (-/-) ). VIP and arginine vasopressin (AVP) signaling showed redundancy in expressing the tissue-level circadian rhythm in the SCN. AVP synthesis was significantly attenuated in the Cry1,2 (-/-) SCN, which contributes to aperiodicity in the adult mice together with an attenuation of VIP signaling as a natural process of ontogeny. The SCN network consists of multiple clusters of cellular circadian rhythms that are differentially integrated by AVP and VIP signaling, depending on the postnatal period."
"The mammalian circadian clock is an endogenous biological timer comprised of transcriptional/translational feedback loops of clock genes. Bmal1 encodes an indispensable transcription factor for the generation of circadian rhythms. Here, we report a new circadian mutant mouse from gene-trapped embryonic stem cells harboring a C-terminus truncated Bmal1 (Bmal1GTDeltaC) allele. The homozygous mutant (Bmal1GTDeltaC/GTDeltaC) mice immediately lost circadian behavioral rhythms under constant darkness. The heterozygous (Bmal1+/GTDeltaC) mice displayed a gradual loss of rhythms, in contrast to Bmal1+/- mice where rhythms were sustained. Bmal1GTDeltaC/GTDeltaC mice also showed arrhythmic mRNA and protein expression in the SCN and liver. Lack of circadian reporter oscillation was also observed in cultured fibroblast cells, indicating that the arrhythmicity of Bmal1GTDeltaC/GTDeltaC mice resulted from impaired molecular clock machinery. Expression of clock genes exhibited distinct responses to the mutant allele in Bmal1+/GTDeltaC and Bmal1GTDeltaC/GTDeltaC mice. Despite normal cellular localization and heterodimerization with CLOCK, overexpressed BMAL1GTDeltaC was unable to activate transcription of Per1 promoter and BMAL1-dependent CLOCK degradation. These results indicate that the C-terminal region of Bmal1 has pivotal roles in the regulation of circadian rhythms and the Bmal1GTDeltaC mice constitute a novel model system to evaluate circadian functional mechanism of BMAL1."
"The C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of BMAL1 (brain and muscle ARNT-like 1) is a regulatory hub for transcriptional coactivators and repressors that compete for binding and, consequently, contributes to period determination of the mammalian circadian clock. Here, we report the discovery of two distinct conformational states that slowly exchange within the dynamic TAD to control timing. This binary switch results from cis/trans isomerization about a highly conserved Trp-Pro imide bond in a region of the TAD that is required for normal circadian timekeeping. Both cis and trans isomers interact with transcriptional regulators, suggesting that isomerization could serve a role in assembling regulatory complexes in vivo. Toward this end, we show that locking the switch into the trans isomer leads to shortened circadian periods. Furthermore, isomerization is regulated by the cyclophilin family of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases, highlighting the potential for regulation of BMAL1 protein dynamics in period determination."
"Circadian rhythms (CRs) provide temporal regulation and coordination of numerous physiological traits, including immune function. CRs in multiple aspects of immune function are impaired in rodents that have been rendered circadian-arrhythmic through various methods. In Siberian hamsters, circadian arrhythmia can be induced by disruptive light treatments (DPS). Here we examined CRs in wound healing, and the effects of circadian disruption on wound healing in DPS-arrhythmic hamsters. Circadian entrained/rhythmic (RHYTH) and behaviorally-arrhythmic (ARR) female hamsters were administered a cutaneous wound either 3h after light onset (ZT03) or 2h after dark onset (ZT18); wound size was quantified daily using image analyses. Among RHYTH hamsters, ZT03 wounds healed faster than ZT18 wounds, whereas in ARR hamsters, circadian phase did not affect wound healing. In addition, wounds healed slower in ARR hamsters. The results document a clear CR in wound healing, and indicate that the mere presence of organismal circadian organization enhances this aspect of immune function. Faster wound healing in CR-competent hamsters may be mediated by CR-driven coordination of the temporal order of mechanisms (inflammation, leukocyte trafficking, tissue remodeling) underlying cutaneous wound healing."
"The rhythms in the expression of circadian clock genes are affected by calorie restriction (CR), a dietary paradigm known to increase lifespan. Many physiological effects of CR differ between males and females; here we investigated if the sex of animals affects the CR induced changes in the circadian rhythms. The liver expression of some circadian clock genes such as Bmal1 and three Periods (Per1, Per2 and Per3) and the effect of CR on the expression of these genes were sex independent, while the expression of Rev-Erb alpha, Ror gamma and both Cryptochome (Cry1 and Cry2) genes was different between males and females. The effect of CR on Rev-Erb alpha, Ror gamma and Cry1 gene expression was sex dependent. The expression and the effects of CR were sex-specific for several genes previously reported to be regulated by CR: Fmo3, Mup4, Serpina12 and Cyp4a12, while the expression of Cyp4a14a was sex independent. IGF signaling plays an important role in aging and CR effects. Igf-1 expression is regulated by CR and by the circadian clock, we found that rhythms in Igf-1 expression have sexual dimorphism. Our data provide molecular evidence that the sex of animals is an important modulator of circadian rhythms in gene expression and their response to CR."
"Biological rhythms are fundamental for homeostasis and have recently been involved in the regulatory processes of various organs and systems. Circadian cycle proteins and hormones have a direct effect on the inflammatory response and have shown pro- or anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of autoimmune diseases. The cells of the immune system have their own circadian rhythm, and the light-dark cycle directly influences the inflammatory response. On the other hand, patients with autoimmune diseases characteristically have sleep disorders and fatigue, and in certain disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a frank periodicity in the signs and symptoms is recognized. The joint symptoms predominate in the morning, and apparently, subjects with RA have relative adrenal insufficiency, with a cortisol peak unable to control the late night load of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Transatlantic flights represent a challenge in the adjustment of biological rhythms, since they imply sleep deprivation, time zone changes, and potential difficulties for drug administration. In patients with autoimmune diseases, the use of DMARDs and prednisone at night is probably best suited to lessen morning symptoms. It is also essential to sleep during the trip to improve adaptation to the new time zone and to avoid, as far as possible, works involving flexible or nocturnal shifts. The study of proteins and hormones related to biological rhythms will demonstrate new pathophysiological pathways of autoimmune diseases, which will emphasize the use of general measures for sleep respect and methods for drug administration at key daily times to optimize their anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory effects."
"Circadian rhythms are the approximate 24-h biological cycles that function to prepare an organism for daily environmental changes. They are driven by the molecular clock, a transcriptional:translational feedback mechanism that in mammals involves the core clock genes Bmal1, Clock, Per1/2, and Cry1/2. The molecular clock is present in virtually all cells of an organism. The central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) has been well studied, but the clocks in the peripheral tissues, such as heart and skeletal muscle, have just begun to be investigated. Skeletal muscle is one of the largest organs in the body, comprising approximately 45% of total body mass. More than 2300 genes in skeletal muscle are expressed in a circadian pattern, and these genes participate in a wide range of functions, including myogenesis, transcription, and metabolism. The circadian rhythms of skeletal muscle can be entrained both indirectly through light input to the SCN and directly through time of feeding and activity. It is critical for the skeletal muscle molecular clock not only to be entrained to the environment but also to be in synchrony with rhythms of other tissues. When circadian rhythms are disrupted, the observed effects on skeletal muscle include fiber-type shifts, altered sarcomeric structure, reduced mitochondrial respiration, and impaired muscle function. Furthermore, there are detrimental effects on metabolic health, including impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, which skeletal muscle likely contributes to considering it is a key metabolic tissue. These data indicate a critical role for skeletal muscle circadian rhythms for both muscle and systems health. Future research is needed to determine the mechanisms of molecular clock function in skeletal muscle, identify the means by which skeletal muscle entrainment occurs, and provide a stringent comparison of circadian gene expression across the diverse tissue system of skeletal muscle."
"Entrainment of circadian rhythms (CR) to the light dark cycle has been well described under controlled, experimental conditions. However, studies in rodents have reported that rhythms in the laboratory are not always reproduced under field conditions. The aim of this study was to characterise the CR of sheep maintained under conditions of standard UK farm animal husbandry and to investigate the effects of environmental challenges presented by season, weaning and changes in housing on CR. Male sheep (n=9) were kept at pasture, or group housed in barns, under natural photoperiod for one year. CR in locomotor activity were monitored using accelerometry, and 24h patterns in plasma cortisol and melatonin were measured every 4h by ELISA. CR was measured before and after weaning, in summer and winter, and at pasture and by barn housing. Cosinor analysis revealed high amplitude, diurnal rhythms in locomotor activity that were disrupted by weaning and by barn housing. Rhythms in winter showed an interrupted night time activity pattern, but only when the sheep were kept at pasture. Cortisol and melatonin secretion followed typical circadian patterns in winter and summer. The CR of the sheep under the field conditions of this study were strikingly robust under basal conditions, but easily disrupted by environmental challenges. Interrupted patterns of activity during the long nights of wintertime, not previously reported for sheep kept in experimental conditions were recorded. Based on these findings, we propose that animals require exposure to more complex environments than the laboratory in order to exhibit their true circadian phenotype."
"Circadian rhythms, metabolism and nutrition are closely interlinked. A great deal of recent research has investigated not only how aspects of metabolic physiology are driven by circadian clocks, but also how these circadian clocks are themselves sensitive to metabolic change. At the cellular level, novel feedback loops have been identified that couple circadian 'clock genes' and their proteins to expression of nuclear receptors, regulation of redox state and other major pathways. Using targeted disruption of circadian clocks, mouse models are providing novel insight into the role of tissue-specific clocks in glucose homeostasis and body weight regulation. The relationship between circadian rhythms and obesity appears complex, with variable alteration of rhythms in obese individuals. However, it is clear from animal studies that the timing and nutritional composition of meals can regulate circadian rhythms, particularly in peripheral tissues. Translation of these findings to human physiology now represents an important goal."
"Almost all forms of life have predictable daily or circadian rhythms in molecular, endocrine, and behavioral functions. In mammals, a central pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei coordinates the timing of these rhythms. Daily light exposure that affects the retina of the eye directly influences this area, which is required to align endogenous processes to the appropriate time of day. The present ""Views and Reviews"" articles discuss the influence of circadian rhythms, especially nightly secretion of melatonin, on reproductive function and parturition. In addition, an examination is made of problems that arise from recurrent circadian rhythm disruption associated with changes in light exposure patterns common to modern day society. Finally, a possible solution to prevent disruptions in circadian phase markers by filtering out short wavelengths from nocturnal light is reviewed."
"AIM: Both hyperuricaemia and activation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) play an important role in the development of hypertension and renal damage. However, it has not been clear whether hyperuricaemia is associated with renal damage due to hypertension or intrarenal RAS activation, as well as their circadian rhythms. METHODS: We recruited 43 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who did not receive RAS blockers and antihyperuricaemic drugs, and investigated the relationship among serum uric acid (sUA) levels, the circadian rhythm of urinary angiotensinogen (U-AGT) excretion levels, and the levels of albuminuria (U-ACR) and proteinuria (U-P/Cr). RESULTS: sUA levels were significantly associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (P = 0.002), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (daytime, P = 0.031), and U-ACR (daytime, P = 0.006 and nighttime, P = 0.008) and U-P/Cr (daytime, P = 0.017 and nighttime, P = 0.013). However, there were no significant differences between sUA levels and SBP in nighttime and U-AGT excretion levels in both time periods. Multiple regression analyses for sUA levels were performed using age, sex, eGFR and each parameter (SBP, U-AGT/Cr, U-ACR or U-P/Cr). sUA levels were not associated with SBP or U-AGT/Cr in both time periods. sUA levels tended to correlate with U-P/Cr levels in nighttime, and were significantly associated with U-P/Cr in daytime (P = 0.026) and U-ACR in daytime (P = 0.017) and nighttime (P = 0.046). Moreover, no significant differences were found between sUA levels and night-to-day ratios of some parameters. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that hyperuricaemia is associated with renal damage, independently of hypertension and intrarenal RAS activation, as well as their circadian rhythms."
"This study examined the link between circadian rhythm changes due to bright light exposure and subthreshold bipolarity. Molecular circadian rhythms, polysomnography, and actigraphy data were studied in 25 young, healthy male subjects, divided into high and low mood disorder questionnaire (MDQ) score groups. During the first 2 days of the study, the subjects were exposed to daily-living light (150 lux) for 4 hours before bedtime. Saliva and buccal cells were collected 5 times a day for 2 consecutive days. During the subsequent 5 days, the subjects were exposed to bright light (1,000 lux), and saliva and buccal cell samples were collected in the same way. Molecular circadian rhythms were analyzed using sine regression. Circadian rhythms of cortisol (F = 16.956, p < 0.001) and relative PER1/ARNTL gene expression (F = 122.1, p < 0.001) showed a delayed acrophase in both groups after bright light exposure. The high MDQ score group showed a significant delay in acrophase compared to the low MDQ score group only in salivary cortisol (F = 8.528, p = 0.008). The high MDQ score group showed hypersensitivity in cortisol rhythm shift after bright light exposure, suggesting characteristic molecular circadian rhythm changes in the high MDQ score group may be related to biological processes downstream from core circadian clock gene expression."
"INTRODUCTION: The high rate of autoagressive action in patients with psychotic symptoms manifested during the beginning of active psychopharmatherapy, and they are often the reason for psychiatric help. The continuous growth of autoagressive behavior indicates the number of unsolved problems in clinical suicidology. AIM: The aim of this research was to explore the clinical and psychopathological characteristics of the autoagressive behavior in patients with the first psychotic episode with considering circadian rhythms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: There was a research in regional clinical psychiatric hospital and 130 patients were involved in the research with autoagressive behavior during the first psychotic episodes. Clinical and psychopathological, psychodiagnostic and statistical methods were used. Characteristic clinical manifestations of first psychotic episode is determined by PANSS [1986] and BPRS [1962], level of suicidal risk is determined by Lyuban-Plotstsa's scale [2000], characteristics of biological rhythms is established by Estberg's questionnaire [1986]. RESULTS: Certain psychiatric symptoms were associated with the level of suicide risk in the first episode of psychosis, such as <<tension"", <<hostility"", <<mannerisms and posturing, <<excitement>>, <<suspiciousness>>, <<somatic concern>>, <<anxiety>>, <<depression>>, <<guilt>>. Circadian rhythms include the level of risk occurrence and severity autoagressive behavior such as clearly and dimly expressed evening types of daily activity. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, further research of autoagression during the first psychotic episode with considering the influence of biological rhythms is a given area of current research in psychiatry aimed to improve the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation."
"Several lines of evidence suggest a regulatory role of histamine in circadian rhythms, but little is known about signaling pathways that would be involved in such a putative role. The aim of this study was to examine whether histamine mediates its effects on the circadian system through Hrh1 or Hrh3 receptors. We assessed both diurnal and free-running locomotor activity rhythms of Hrh1-/- and Hrh3-/- mice. We also determined the expression of Per1, Per2 and Bmal1 genes in the suprachiasmatic nuclei, several areas of the cerebral cortex and striatum under symmetric 24 h light-dark cycle at zeitgeber times 14 and 6 by using radioactive in situ hybridization. We found no differences between Hrh1-/- and wild type mice in the length, amplitude and mesor of diurnal and free-running activity rhythms as well as in expression of Per1, Per2 and Bmal1 genes in any of the examined brain structures. The amplitude of free-running activity rhythm of the Hrh3-/- mice was significantly flattened, whereas the expression of the clock genes in Hrh3-/- mice was similar to the wild type animals in all of the assessed brain structures. Therefore, the knockout of Hrh1 receptor had no effects on the circadian rhythm of spontaneous locomotion, and a knockout of Hrh3 receptor caused a substantial reduction of free-running activity rhythm amplitude, but none of these knockout models affected the expression patterns of the core clock genes in any of the studied brain structures."
"PURPOSE: Intraocular pressure (IOP) is known to have a strong circadian rhythm, yet how light/dark cycles entrain this rhythm is unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess whether, like the retina, the mammalian ciliary body and IOP clocks have an intrinsic ability to entrain to light/dark cycles. METHODS: Iris-ciliary body complexes were obtained from period2:luciferase (PER2::LUC) mice and cultured to measure bioluminescence rhythmicity. Pairs of the iris-ciliary body complex were exposed to antiphasic 9:15 h light/dark cycle in vitro. After 4 days of exposure to light/dark cycles, bioluminescence was recorded to establish their circadian phases. In addition, pairs of the iris-ciliary body complex co-cultured with the retinas or corneas of wild-type mice were also investigated. The IOP circadian changes of free-running Opn4-/-;rd1/rd1 mice whose behavior was antiphasic to wild-type were measured by a rebound tonometry, and compared with wild-type mice. Opn3, Opn4, and Opn5 mRNA expression in the iris-ciliary body were analyzed using RT-PCR. RESULTS: The iris/ciliary body complex expressed Opn3, Opn4, and Opn5 mRNA; however, unlike in retina and cornea, neither the iris-CB complex nor the co-cultured complex was directly entrained by light-dark cycle in vitro. The diurnal IOP change of Opn4-/-;rd1/rd1 mice showed an antiphasic pattern to wild-type mice and their rhythms followed the whole-animal behavioral rhythm. CONCLUSIONS: Despite expressing mRNA for several non-visual opsins, circadian rhythms of the iris-ciliary body complex of mice do not entrain directly to light-dark cycles ex vivo. Unlike retina, the iris/ciliary body clocks of blind mice remain synchronized to the organismal behavioral rhythm rather than local light-dark cycles. These results suggest that IOP rhythm entrainment is mediated by a systemic rather than local signal in mice."
"Circadian rhythms have a profound influence on most bodily functions: from metabolism to complex behaviors. They ensure that all these biological processes are optimized with the time-of-day. They are generated by endogenous molecular oscillators that have a period that closely, but not exactly, matches day length. These molecular clocks are synchronized by environmental cycles such as light intensity and temperature. Drosophila melanogaster has been a model organism of choice to understand genetically, molecularly and at the level of neural circuits how circadian rhythms are generated, how they are synchronized by environmental cues, and how they drive behavioral cycles such as locomotor rhythms. This review will cover a wide range of techniques that have been instrumental to our understanding of Drosophila circadian rhythms, and that are essential for current and future research."
"Most aspects of energy metabolism display clear variations during day and night. This daily rhythmicity of metabolic functions, including hormone release, is governed by a circadian system that consists of the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus (SCN) and many secondary clocks in the brain and peripheral organs. The SCN control peripheral timing via the autonomic and neuroendocrine system, as well as via behavioral outputs. The sleep-wake cycle, the feeding/fasting rhythm and most hormonal rhythms, including that of leptin, ghrelin and glucocorticoids, usually show an opposite phase (relative to the light-dark cycle) in diurnal and nocturnal species. By contrast, the SCN clock is most active at the same astronomical times in these two categories of mammals. Moreover, in both species, pineal melatonin is secreted only at night. In this review we describe the current knowledge on the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism by central and peripheral clock mechanisms. Most experimental knowledge comes from studies in nocturnal laboratory rodents. Nevertheless, we will also mention some relevant findings in diurnal mammals, including humans. It will become clear that as a consequence of the tight connections between the circadian clock system and energy metabolism, circadian clock impairments (e.g., mutations or knock-out of clock genes) and circadian clock misalignments (such as during shift work and chronic jet-lag) have an adverse effect on energy metabolism, that may trigger or enhancing obese and diabetic symptoms."
"Circadian rhythm is manifested by the behavioral and physiological changes from day to night, which is controlled by the pacemaker and its regulator. The former is located at the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in the anterior hypothalamus, while the latter is composed of clock genes present in all tissues. Circadian desynchronization influences normal patterns of day-night rhythms such as sleep and alertness cycles, rest and activity cycles. Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibits diurnal fluctuations. Circadian dysfunction has been observed in PD patients and animal models, which may result in negative consequences to the homeostasis and even exacerbate the disease progression. Therefore, circadian therapies, including light stimulation, physical activity, dietary and social schedules, may be helpful for PD patients. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the circadian dysfunction in PD remain elusive. Further research on circadian patterns is needed. This article summarizes the existing research on the circadian rhythms in PD, focusing on the clinical symptom variations, molecular changes, as well as the available treatment options."
"Circadian rhythms optimize physiology and health by temporally coordinating cellular function, tissue function, and behavior. These endogenous rhythms dampen with age and thus compromise temporal coordination. Feeding-fasting patterns are an external cue that profoundly influence the robustness of daily biological rhythms. Erratic eating patterns can disrupt the temporal coordination of metabolism and physiology leading to chronic diseases that are also characteristic of aging. However, sustaining a robust feeding-fasting cycle, even without altering nutrition quality or quantity, can prevent or reverse these chronic diseases in experimental models. In humans, epidemiological studies have shown erratic eating patterns increase the risk of disease, whereas sustained feeding-fasting cycles, or prolonged overnight fasting, is correlated with protection from breast cancer. Therefore, optimizing the timing of external cues with defined eating patterns can sustain a robust circadian clock, which may prevent disease and improve prognosis."
"Circadian time-keeping mechanisms preserve homeostasis by synchronizing internal physiology with predictable variations in the environment and temporally organize the activation of physiological signaling mechanisms to promote survival and optimize the allocation of energetic resources. In this paper, we highlight the importance of the robust circadian dynamics of allostatic mediators, with a focus on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, for the optimal regulation of host physiology and in enabling organisms to adequately respond and adapt to physiological stressors. We review studies showing how the chronic disruption of circadian rhythms can result in the accumulation of allostatic load, which impacts the appropriate functioning of physiological systems and diminishes the resilience of internal systems to adequately respond to subsequent stressors. A careful consideration of circadian rhythm dynamics leads to a more comprehensive characterization of individual variability in allostatic load and stress resilience. Finally, we suggest that the restoration of circadian rhythms after pathological disruption can enable the re-engagement of allostatic mechanisms and re-establish stress resilience."
"In mammals, behavioral and physiological rhythms are controlled by circadian clocks which are entrained by environmental light and food signals. However, how the environmental cues affect digestive tract's circadian clock remains poorly understood. Therefore, in order to elucidate the effect of light cue on the resetting of the peripheral clocks, we investigated the expressions of clock genes (Bmal1, Cry1, Rev-erbalpha, Per1, and Per2) and digestive function genes (Cck, Cck-1r, Sct, Sctr, and Ctrb1) in the pancreas and duodenum of rats after the light-dark (LD) cycle reversal for 7 days. We found that both the clock genes and digestive function genes exhibited a clear and similar daily rhythmicity in the pancreas and duodenum of rats. After reversal of the LD cycle for 7 days, the expressions of clock genes in pancreas, including Bmal1, Cry1, and Rev-erbalpha were affected; whereas the expression of Per1 gene failed to fit the cosine wave. However, in the duodenum the shifted genes were Bmal1, Rev-erbalpha, and Per2; in parallel, the Per1 gene expression also lost its circadian rhythm by reversal of the LD cycle. Therefore, the acrophases of the clock genes were shifted in a tissue- and gene-specific manner. Furthermore, the profiles of the digestive function genes, including Sctr and Ctrb1, were also affected by changes in LD cycle. These observations suggest that the mechanisms underlying the pancreatic and duodenal clocks are distinct, and there may be a potential linkage between the circadian clock system and the digestive system."
"Physiological and cellular functions operate in a 24-hour cyclical pattern orchestrated by an endogenous process known as the circadian rhythm. Circadian rhythms represent intrinsic oscillations of biological functions that allow for adaptation to cyclic environmental changes. Key clock genes that affect the persistence and periodicity of circadian rhythms include BMAL1/CLOCK, Period 1, Period 2, and Cryptochrome. Remarkable progress has been made in our understanding of circadian rhythms and their role in common medical conditions. A critical review of the literature supports the association between circadian misalignment and adverse health consequences in sepsis, obstructive lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and malignancy. Circadian misalignment plays an important role in these disease processes and can affect disease severity, treatment response, and survivorship. Normal inflammatory response to acute infections, airway resistance, upper airway collapsibility, and mitosis regulation follows a robust circadian pattern. Disruption of normal circadian rhythm at the molecular level affects severity of inflammation in sepsis, contributes to inflammatory responses in obstructive lung diseases, affects apnea length in obstructive sleep apnea, and increases risk for cancer. Chronotherapy is an underused practice of delivering therapy at optimal times to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity. This approach has been shown to be advantageous in asthma and cancer management. In asthma, appropriate timing of medication administration improves treatment effectiveness. Properly timed chemotherapy may reduce treatment toxicities and maximize efficacy. Future research should focus on circadian rhythm disorders, role of circadian rhythm in other diseases, and modalities to restore and prevent circadian disruption."
"In Lepidoptera, the roles of period ( per) and the negative feedback involving this gene in circadian rhythm are controversial. In the present study, we established a per knockout strain using TALEN in Bombyx mori, and compared eclosion and hatching rhythms between the per-knockout and wild-type strains to examine whether per is actually involved in these rhythms. The generated per knockout allele was considered null, because it encoded an extensively truncated form of PERIOD (198 aa due to a 64-bp deletion in exon 7, in contrast to 1113 aa in the wild-type protein). In this per knockout strain, circadian rhythms in eclosion and hatching were disrupted. Under LD cycles, however, a steep peak existed at 1 h after lights-on in both eclosion and hatching, and was considered to be produced by a masking effect-a direct response to light. In the per-knockout strain, temporal expression changes of per and timeless ( tim) were also lost. The expression levels of tim were continuously high, probably due to the loss of negative feedback by per and tim. In contrast, the expression levels of per were much lower in the per knockout strain than in the wild type at every time point. From these results, we concluded that per is indispensable for circadian rhythms, and we suggest that the negative feedback loop of the circadian rhythm involving per functions for the production of behavioral rhythms in B. mori."
"Treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSD) may include light therapy, chronotherapy and melatonin. Exogenous melatonin is increasingly being used in patients with insomnia or CRSD. Although pharmacopoeias and the European food safety authority (EFSA) recommend administering melatonin 1-2 h before desired bedtime, several studies have shown that melatonin is not always effective if administered according to that recommendation. Crucial for optimal treatment of CRSD, melatonin and other treatments should be administered at a time related to individual circadian timing (typically assessed using the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO)). If not administered according to the individual patient's circadian timing, melatonin and other treatments may not only be ineffective, they may even result in contrary effects. Endogenous melatonin levels can be measured reliably in saliva collected at the patient's home. A clinically reliably DLMO can be calculated using a fixed threshold. Diary and polysomnographic sleep-onset time do not reliably predict DLMO or circadian timing in patients with CRSD. Knowing the patient's individual circadian timing by assessing DLMO can improve diagnosis and treatment of CRSD with melatonin as well as other therapies such as light or chronotherapy, and optimizing treatment timing will shorten the time required to achieve results."
"BACKGROUND: Virtually, all organisms on Earth have their own circadian rhythm, and humans are no exception. Circadian rhythms are associated with various human states, especially mood disorders, and disturbance of the circadian rhythm is known to be very closely related. Attempts have also been made to derive clinical implications associated with mood disorders using the vast amounts of digital log that is acquired by digital technologies develop and using computational analysis techniques. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate the mood state or episode, activity, sleep, light exposure, and heart rate during a period of about 2 years by acquiring various digital log data through wearable devices and smartphone apps as well as conventional clinical assessments. We investigated a mood prediction algorithm developed with machine learning using passive data phenotypes based on circadian rhythms. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational cohort study on 55 patients with mood disorders (major depressive disorder [MDD] and bipolar disorder type 1 [BD I] and 2 [BD II]) for 2 years. A smartphone app for self-recording daily mood scores and detecting light exposure (using the installed sensor) were provided. From daily worn activity trackers, digital log data of activity, sleep, and heart rate were collected. Passive digital phenotypes were processed into 130 features based on circadian rhythms, and a mood prediction algorithm was developed by random forest. RESULTS: The mood state prediction accuracies for the next 3 days in all patients, MDD patients, BD I patients, and BD II patients were 65%, 65%, 64%, and 65% with 0.7, 0.69, 0.67, and 0.67 area under the curve (AUC) values, respectively. The accuracies of all patients for no episode (NE), depressive episode (DE), manic episode (ME), and hypomanic episode (HME) were 85.3%, 87%, 94%, and 91.2% with 0.87, 0.87, 0.958, and 0.912 AUC values, respectively. The prediction accuracy in BD II patients was distinctively balanced as high showing 82.6%, 74.4%, and 87.5% of accuracy (with generally good sensitivity and specificity) with 0.919, 0.868, and 0.949 AUC values for NE, DE, and HME, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the theoretical basis of chronobiology, this study proposed a good model for future research by developing a mood prediction algorithm using machine learning by processing and reclassifying digital log data. In addition to academic value, it is expected that this study will be of practical help to improve the prognosis of patients with mood disorders by making it possible to apply actual clinical application owing to the rapid expansion of digital technology."
"Almost all the body's functions exhibit circadian rhythm maintained in a cell by a system of Clock genes and proteins. Failure to synchronize or loss of these rhythms are found in aged organism and are associated with risk of cancer development. The article describes data on mechanisms of circadian rhythms regulation in whole organism and cell, rhythm change during aging and relationship between rhythm disturbances and tumorigenesis of different localisations in humans and animals."
"The eye contains a circadian system that acts independently from the master circadian clock located in the brain. This circadian system regulates important physiological functions within the eye. Emerging experimental evidence also indicates that disruption of the ocular circadian clock, or its outputs, negatively affects the overall health of the eye. Although previous studies have investigated the effect of aging on the regulation of circadian rhythms, no study has investigated the effects of aging on the circadian rhythm in the ocular system. The aim of the present study was to investigate how aging affects the circadian rhythm of PER2::LUC bioluminescence in the retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and cornea. Our data suggest that among the 3 different ocular tissues investigated, the retina appears to be the most affected by aging whereas the RPE and cornea are less affected by aging. Our data, along with studies of other organs and tissues, suggest that reduction in the amplitude of rhythms is probably the most severe effect of aging on the circadian clock."
"Studies have shown that a normal circadian rhythm is crucial to learning and memory. Circadian rhythm disturbances that occur at early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) aggravate the progression of the disease and further reduce learning and memory in AD patients. The novel, dual GLP-1R/GIPR agonist DA-JC1 has been found to exert a stronger hypoglycemic effect than a GLP-1R agonist alone and has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects. However, it is not clear whether DA-JC1 improves the Abeta31-35-induced decline in learning and memory ability by restoring disrupted circadian rhythms. In the present study, we carried out a mouse wheel-running experiment and Morris water maze test (MWM) and found that DA-JC1 could effectively improve the decline of learning and memory and circadian rhythm disorders induced by Abeta31-35. After downregulating Per2 expression via lentivirus-shPer2 in the hippocampus and the hippocampal HT22 cells, we found that circadian rhythm disorders occurred, and that DA-JC1 could not improve the impaired learning and memory. These results suggest that DA-JC1 improves damage to learning and memory by antagonizing circadian rhythm disorders induced by Abeta31-35. The outcome of this ongoing study may provide a novel therapeutic intervention for AD in the future."
"The master mammalian circadian clock (i.e. central clock), located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, orchestrates the synchronization of the daily behavioural and physiological rhythms to better adapt the organism to the external environment in an anticipatory manner. This central clock is entrained by a variety of signals, the best established being light and food. However, circadian cycles are not simply the consequences of these two cues but are generated by endogenous circadian clocks. Indeed, clock machinery is found in mainly all tissues and cell types, including cells of the vascular system such as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells and stem cells. This machinery physiologically contributes to modulate the daily vascular function, and its disturbance therefore plays a major role in the pathophysiology of vascular dysfunction. Therapies targeting the circadian rhythm may therefore be of benefit against vascular disease."
"Many physiological processes are regulated with a 24-h periodicity to anticipate the environmental changes of daytime to nighttime and vice versa. These 24-h regulations, commonly termed circadian rhythms, among others control the sleep-wake cycle, locomotor activity and preparation for food availability during the active phase (daytime for humans and nighttime for nocturnal animals). Disturbing circadian rhythms at the organ or whole-body level by social jetlag or shift work, increases the risk to develop chronic metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. The molecular basis of this risk is a topic of increasing interest. Mitochondria are essential organelles that produce the majority of energy in eukaryotes by converting lipids and carbohydrates into ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. To adapt to the ever-changing environment, mitochondria are highly dynamic in form and function and a loss of this flexibility is linked to metabolic diseases. Interestingly, recent studies have indicated that changes in mitochondrial morphology (i.e., fusion and fission) as well as generation of new mitochondria are dependent on a viable circadian clock. In addition, fission and fusion processes display diurnal changes that are aligned to the light/darkness cycle. Besides morphological changes, mitochondrial respiration also displays diurnal changes. Disturbing the molecular clock in animal models leads to abrogated mitochondrial rhythmicity and altered respiration. Moreover, mitochondrial-dependent production of reactive oxygen species, which plays a role in cellular signaling, has also been linked to the circadian clock. In this review, we will summarize recent advances in the study of circadian rhythms of mitochondria and how this is linked to the molecular circadian clock."
"A study was conducted to determine the circadian rhythms and trends of vitamin D metabolites including 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 , 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone, in addition to serum calcium, phosphorus and magnesium concentrations in horses over 48 h on the shortest and longest days of the year in 2013. Five healthy adult horses (Equus caballus) were on a constant pasture feeding regimen, and blood samples were collected from each horse every 3 h over a 48-h period, starting at 07:00 PM on day one and finishing at 07:00 PM on day three, for the measurement of calciotropic hormones and electrolytes. There was a significant difference between the serum concentration of calciotropic hormones, iCa, tCa, P and tMg between the shortest (winter) and longest (summer) days of the year in horses. Serum concentration of 25OHD3 was very low and mostly undetectable. Serum iCa, 1,25(OH)2 D and PTH concentrations clearly showed a circadian rhythm on the longest days of the year and serum tCa, P and tMg concentrations showed a diurnal pattern on the longest days (summer) of the year. None of the analytes showed any circadian rhythm on the shortest days (winter) of the year. The result of this study could have significant relevance to equine athletes travelling to international equestrian competitions and facing a huge time and seasonal differences that might affect their ability to adjust their circadian rhythms to new time zones."
"Changes in ocular growth that lead to myopia or hyperopia are associated with alterations in the circadian rhythms in eye growth, choroidal thickness and intraocular pressure in animal models of emmetropization. Recent studies have shown that light at night has deleterious effects on human health, acting via ""circadian disruptions"" of various diurnal rhythms, including changes in phase or amplitude. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of brief, 2-h episodes of light in the middle of the night on the rhythms in axial length and choroidal thickness, and whether these alter eye growth and refractive error in the chick model of myopia. Starting at 2 weeks of age, birds received 2 h of light between 12:00 am and 2:00 am for 7 days (n = 12; total hours of light: 14 h). Age-matched controls had a continuous dark night (n = 14; 14L/10D). Ocular dimensions were measured using high-frequency A-scan ultrasonography on the first day of the experiment, and again on day 7, at 6-h intervals, starting at noon (12 pm, 6 pm, 12 am, 6 am, 12 pm). Measurements during the night were done under a photographic safe-light. These data were used to determine rhythm parameters of phase and amplitude. 2 groups of birds, both experimental (light at night) and control, were measured with ultrasound at various intervals over the course of 4 weeks to determine growth rates. Refractive errors were measured in 6 experimental and 6 control birds at the end of 2 weeks. Eyes of birds in a normal L/D cycle showed sinusoidal 24-h period diurnal rhythms in axial length and choroid thickness. Light in the middle of the night caused changes in both the rhythms in axial length and choroidal thickness, such that neither could be fit to a sine function having a period of 24 h. Light caused an acute, transient stimulation in ocular growth rate in the subsequent 6-h period (12 am-6 am), that may be responsible for the increased growth rate seen 4 weeks later, and the more myopic refractive error. It also abolished the increase in choroidal thickness that normally occurs between 6 pm and 12 am. We conclude that light at night alters the rhythms in axial length and choroidal thickness in an animal model of eye growth, and that these circadian disruptions might lead to the development of ametropias. These results have implications for the use of light during the night in children."
"The role of light and feeding cycles in synchronizing self-feeding and locomotor activity rhythms was studied in white shrimps using a new self-feeding system activated by photocell trigger. In experiment 1, shrimps maintained under a 12:12h light/dark (LD) photoperiod were allowed to self-feed using feeders connected to a photoelectric cell, while locomotor activity was recorded with a second photocell. On day 30, animals were subjected to constant darkness (DD) for 12days to check the existence of endogenous circadian rhythms. In the experiment 2, shrimps were exposed to both a 12:12h LD photoperiod and a fixed meal schedule in the middle of the dark period (MD, 01:00h). On day 20, shrimps were exposed to DD conditions and the same fixed feeding. On day 30, they were maintained under DD and fasted for 7days. The results revealed that under LD, shrimps showed a clear nocturnal feeding pattern and locomotor activity (81.9% and 67.7% of total daily food-demands and locomotor activity, respectively, at nighttime). Both feeding and locomotor rhythms were endogenously driven and persisted under DD with an average period length (tau) close to 24h (circadian) (tau=24.18+/-0.13 and 23.87+/-0.14h for locomotor and feeding, respectively). Moreover, Shrimp showed a daily food intake under LD condition (1.1+/-0.2gday(-1) in the night phase vs. 0.2+/-0.1gday(-1) in the light phase). Our findings might be relevant for some important shrimp aquaculture aspects, such as developing suitable feeding management on shrimp farms."
"We evaluated the circadian phenotypes of patients with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD) and non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder (N24SWD), two different circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSDs) by measuring clock gene expression rhythms in fibroblast cells derived from individual patients. Bmal1-luciferase (Bmal1-luc) expression rhythms were measured in the primary fibroblast cells derived from skin biopsy samples of patients with DSWPD and N24SWD, as well as control subjects. The period length of the Bmal1-luc rhythm (in vitro period) was distributed normally and was 22.80+/-0.47 (mean+/-s.d.) h in control-derived fibroblasts. The in vitro periods in DSWPD-derived fibroblasts and N24SWD-derived fibroblasts were 22.67+/-0.67 h and 23.18+/-0.70 h, respectively. The N24SWD group showed a significantly longer in vitro period than did the control or DSWPD group. Furthermore, in vitro period was associated with response to chronotherapy in the N24SWD group. Longer in vitro periods were observed in the non-responders (mean+/-s.d.: 23.59+/-0.89 h) compared with the responders (mean+/-s.d.: 22.97+/-0.47 h) in the N24SWD group. Our results indicate that prolonged circadian periods contribute to the onset and poor treatment outcome of N24SWD. In vitro rhythm assays could be useful for predicting circadian phenotypes and clinical prognosis in patients with CRSDs."
"Abnormalities in circadian rhythms have been reported in people with mood disorders, but these abnormalities are marked by considerable inter-individual variability. This study aimed to identify pathophysiological subgroups on the basis of circadian markers and evaluate how these subgroups relate to psychiatric profiles. Thirty-five young adults (18-31 years old) receiving clinical care for unipolar depressive disorders and 15 healthy controls took part to this study. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Young Mania rating scale were used to evaluate the severity of mood symptoms in participants with depressive disorders. All participant underwent ambulatory sleep monitoring with actigraphy for about 12 days before attending a laboratory-based chronobiological assessment which included repeated salivary samples to determine dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and continuous core body temperature (CBT) monitoring using an ingestible temperature sensor. Cluster analyses were conducted across all participants to identify subgroups with consistent circadian timing profiles based on DLMO and the nocturnal minima of CBT. Two clusters were identified: 'delayed' and 'conventional timing' circadian phase. Descriptive analyses showed that the delayed cluster was characterised by abnormal time relationships between circadian phase markers and the sleep-wake cycle. Importantly, individuals from the delayed cluster had worse depression severity (t(28) = -2.7, p = 0.011) and hypomanic symptoms (Z = -2.2, p = 0.041) than their peers with conventional circadian timing. These findings suggest that delayed and disorganised circadian rhythms may be linked to worse psychiatric profiles in young people with depressive disorders."
"Desynchronization of circadian rhythms is a hallmark of depression. The antidepressant agomelatine, which is an MT1/MT2 melatonin receptor agonist/5-HT2C serotonin receptor antagonist has advantages compared to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as a circadian phase-shifting agent. The present study was designed to explore whether agomelatine is able to have an antidepressant effect on rats exposed to chronic constant light (CCL) for 6weeks. Focus is also placed on whether this activity affects diurnal rhythms of depressive-like symptoms and is associated with restoration of impaired circadian rhythms in plasma melatonin and corticosterone. We report that CCL induced a depressive-like symptoms associated with decreased grooming in the splash test during the subjective light/inactive phase. Anhedonia-like deficit in the saccharine preference test and increased immobility in the forced swimming test were both detected during the subjective dark/active phase. The disturbed emotional fluctuations due to CCL were corrected by agomelatine treatment (40mg/kg, i.p. for 3weeks). Agomelatine also restored novelty-induced hypophagia, which reflects an anxiety state, during the subjective Light and Dark phase, respectively, in rats exposed to CCL. Parallel to the observed positive influence on behavior, this melatonin analogue restored impaired circadian patterns of plasma melatonin but not that of corticosterone. These findings demonstrated the antidepressant-like effect of agomelatine in rats exposed to CCL possibly exerted via correction of melatonin rhythms and are suggestive of the therapeutic potential of this drug in a subpopulation of people characterized by a melatonin deficit."
"Circadian clocks evolved to allow plants and animals to adapt their behaviors to the 24-hr change in the external environment due to the Earth's rotation. While the first scientific observation of circadian rhythm in the plant leaf movement may be dated back to the early 18th century, it took 200 years to realize that the leaf movement is controlled by an endogenous circadian clock. The cloning and characterization of the first Drosophila clock gene period in the early 1980s, independently by Jeffery C. Hall and Michael Rosbash at Brandeis University and Michael Young at Rockefeller University, paved the way for their further discoveries of additional genes and proteins, culminating in establishing the so-called transcriptional translational feedback loop (TTFL) model for the generation of autonomous oscillator with a period of approximately 24 h. The 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to honor their discoveries of molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm."
"Advanced primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is characterized by progressive retinal ganglion cell complex (RGCC) damage that may cause subsequent disruption of the circadian rhythms. Therefore, we evaluated circadian body temperature (BT) rhythm and sleep characteristics of 115 individuals (38 men and 77 women) diagnosed with POAG. GLV (global loss volume; %), a measure of RGCC damage, was estimated by high-definition optical coherence tomography, and RGC functional ability was assessed by pattern electroretinogram amplitude (PERGA). Depending on dynamics of POAG progression criteria, two groups were formed that were distinctively different in GLV: Stable POAG group (S-POAG; GLV = 5.95 +/- 1.84, n = 65) and Progressive POAG group (P-POAG; GLV = 24.27 +/- 5.09, n = 50). S-POAG and P-POAG groups were not different in mean age (67.61 +/- 7.56 versus 69.98 +/- 8.15) or body mass index (24.66 +/- 3.03 versus 24.77 +/- 2.90). All subjects performed 21 around-the-clock BT self-measurements during a 72-h period and kept activity/sleep diaries. Results showed pronounced disruption of circadian physiology in POAG and its progression with increasing severity of the disease. The daily mean of BT was unusually low, compared to age-matched controls. Moreover, our results revealed distinctive features of BT circadian rhythm alterations in POAG development and POAG progression. S-POAG is associated with lowered BT circadian rhythm robustness and inter-daily phase stability compared to controls. In the P-POAG group, the mean phase of the circadian BT rhythm was delayed by about 5 h and phases were highly scattered among individual patients, which led to reduced group mean amplitude. Circadian amplitudes of individuals were not different between the groups. Altogether, these results suggest that the body clock still works in POAG patients, but its entrainment to the 24-h environment is compromised. Probably because of the internal desynchronization, bedtime is delayed, and sleep duration is accordingly shortened by about 55 min in P-POAG compared to S-POAG patients. In the entire POAG cohort (both groups), later sleep phase and shorter mean sleep duration correlate with the delayed BT phase (r = 0.215; p = 0.021 and r = 0.322; p = 0.0004, respectively). An RGCC GLV of 15% apparently constitutes a threshold above which a delay of the circadian BT rhythm and a shortening of sleep duration occur."
"Up to 80% of people meeting DSM-IV definitions for schizophrenia will exhibit difficulties with sleep, along with a breakdown in circadian entrainment and rhythmicity. The changes to the sleep and circadian systems in this population are thought to be interdependent, as evidenced by the frequent use of the combined term ""sleep and circadian rhythm disruption"" or ""SCRD"" to describe their occurrence. To understand links between sleep and circadian problems in the schizophrenia population, we analyzed the duration and rhythmicity of sleep behavior in mice lacking function of the immediate early gene early growth response 3 ( Egr3). EGR3 has been associated with schizophrenia risk in humans, and Egr3-deficient (-/-) mice display various features of schizophrenia that are responsive to antipsychotic treatment. While Egr3-/- mice slept less than their wildtype (WT) littermates, they showed no evidence of circadian disorganization; in fact, circadian rhythms of activity were more robust in these mice compared with WT, as measured by time series analysis and the relative amplitude index of Van Someren's suite of non-parametric circadian rhythm analyses. Differences in circadian robustness were maintained when the animals were transferred to several weeks of housing under constant darkness or constant light. Together, our results suggest that Egr3-/- mice retain control over the circadian timekeeping of sleep and wake, while showing impaired sleep. The findings are compatible with those from a surprising array of mouse models of schizophrenia and raise the possibility that SCRD may be 2 separate disorders in the schizophrenia population requiring different treatment strategies."
"Rodent studies often must be conducted during an animal's active phase (that is, in darkness) yet also during a typical day shift for staff. Low-pressure sodium lighting (LPSL), to which human retinas are more sensitive than rodents' at low intensity, has been used to facilitate study conduct in dark phase. The assumption was that LPSL would be equivalent to total darkness due to low rodent retinal sensitivity but provide enough lighting for safe technical manipulations due to higher human retinal sensitivity. Unlike other light sources, LPSL has been tested for effects on circadian rhythm specific to locomotive activities in albino mice. Whether LPSL affects circadian rhythms in rats is unknown. In this study, circadian endpoints were derived from body temperature and locomotor activity via telemeters in 8 adult male Wistar rats. When moved from a 12:12-h white-light (that is, cold white fluorescent light):dark (LD) cycle to a 12:12-h white-light:sodium-light cycle, rats demonstrated free-running and disrupted circadian rhythms (that is, lengthened circadian period and reduced circadian robustness and amplitude). Body temperature and locomotor activity were significantly lower in the LPSL phase as compared with dark phase under the baseline condition. When exposed to a 12:12 h sodium-light:dark (SD) cycle, rats entrained with a circadian period similar to 12:12-h white-light:dark (LD), but significantly different from the period under constant darkness (DD). Circadian onset and acrophase were delayed under SD compared with LD. When illuminated with a LPSL pulse under DD, rats showed phase shifts similar to white-light pulse effects, consistent with the phase response curve. To determine whether the image-forming photoreceptors are involved in this process, we used electroretinography. Compared with white light, 589-nm light generated during electroretinography elicited rod photoreceptors responses with longer latency and cone photoreceptor responses with lower amplitude. These results indicate that LPSL is a weaker zeitgeber than white light and may alter the circadian system in rats. Furthermore, because LPSL appeared to be visible to rats, it may not be an appropriate substitute for actual darkness."
"Everything in nature and life is occurring in a rhythmic manner. The major ""Zeitgeber"" is the change of light and dark during a 24 h day. This circadian rhythm is besides others reflected in circadian rhythms of behaviors or different biochemical parameters. A disruption of the circadian rhythm has a high pathophysiological potential. In this article a few basic issues about the role of circadian rhythms and the pathophysiological importance of desynchronisation are reviewed."
"AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Patients with diabetes frequently develop orthostatic hypotension (OH). The present study was designed to examine the relationship of blood pressure (BP) circadian rhythms and outcomes in diabetes with OH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, 173 inpatients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled. Patients were divided into an OH group and a non-OH group according to the BP changes detected in the supine and standing position. Then, 24-h ambulatory BP was monitored. Patients were followed up for an average of 45 +/- 10 months post-discharge. Outcomes - death and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, including heart failure, myocardial infarction and stroke - were recorded. RESULTS: There were 61 patients (35.26%) in the OH group and 112 patients (64.74%) in the non-OH group. In the OH group, the night-time systolic BP and night-time diastolic BP were higher, the blood BP rhythms were predominantly of the riser type (67.21%). OH was as an independent marker of riser type circadian rhythm (adjusted odds ratio 4.532, 95% confidence interval 2.579-7.966). In the OH group, the incidence rates of mortality, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events were increased significantly compared with those in the non-OH group (11.48 vs 2.68%, P = 0.014; 37.70 vs 8.93%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In patients who had type 2 diabetes diagnosed with OH, the BP circadian rhythm usually showed riser patterns, and they had increased rates of mortality, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events."
"Depression has been associated with circadian disruption and premature aging. Nevertheless, mechanisms underlying the link between long-term stress with premature aging and possible associations with circadian rhythms remain elusive. Here, mice were exposed to chronic mild stress for 16weeks to induce depression-like symptoms, which were confirmed with the open field test, tail suspension test, and sucrose preference test. Then, the circadian rhythms of age-related indexes were compared between control and stressed mice. Long-term stress resulted in decreased body weight gain and locomotor activities, accompanied by losses of subcutaneous backside fat, decreased amounts of thigh muscle fibers, and shortened telomere length in hepatocytes. Stressed mice showed increased oxidative damage, causing impaired mitochondrial function and inflammatory responses, which may be mediated by the sirtuin 3 (SIRT3)-superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) signaling pathway. These changes may be associated with partial disruption of circadian rhythms or shifting phase values of some age-related indicators induced by long-term stress. These findings suggest that long-term exposure to stress may increase the risk of depression and regulate age-related phenotypes through associations with circadian rhythms."
"An organism's biological day is characterized by a pattern of anticipatory physiological and behavioral changes that are governed by circadian clocks to align with the 24-h cycling environment. Here, we used flash electroretinograms (ERGs) and steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) to examine how visual responsiveness in wild-type Drosophila melanogaster and the circadian clock mutant Clk(Jrk) varies over circadian time. We show that the ERG parameters of wild-type flies vary over the circadian day, with a higher luminance response during the subjective night. The SSVEP response that assesses contrast sensitivity also showed a time-of-day dependence, including 2 prominent peaks within a 24-h period and a maximal response at the end of the subjective day, indicating a tradeoff between luminance and contrast sensitivity. Moreover, the behaviorally arrhythmic Clk(Jrk) mutants maintained a circadian profile in both luminance and contrast sensitivity, but unlike the wild-types, which show bimodal profiles in their visual response, Clk(Jrk) flies show a weakening of the bimodal character, with visual responsiveness tending to peak once a day. We conclude that the Clk(Jrk) mutation mainly affects 1 of 2 functionally coupled oscillators and that the visual system is partially separated from the locomotor circadian circuits that drive bouts of morning and evening activity. As light exposure is a major mechanism for entrainment, our work suggests that a detailed temporal analysis of electrophysiological responses is warranted to better identify the time window at which circadian rhythms are most receptive to light-induced phase shifting."
"Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption are potentially modifiable risk factors and consequences of ischaemic stroke. Pre-clinical evidence suggests a direct effect of sleep and endogenous circadian rhythm dysfunction on lesion volumes and post-stroke recovery. In humans, sleep and stroke literature has focused primarily on obstructive sleep apnoea. However, the bidirectional impact of non-apnoea related sleep disorders, sleep architecture, and endogenous circadian rhythm dysfunction in ischaemic stroke remains unclear. A systematic search of publications in three major databases from inception to August 7 2018 identified 67 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Long sleep duration or sleep disorders significantly increased the risk of ischaemic stroke. Inversely, ischaemic stroke was associated with sleep architectural and endogenous circadian rhythm disruption which were generally associated with post-stroke severity and functional outcome. Importantly, no studies examined direct measures of circadian rhythm dysfunction as a risk factor for ischaemic stroke. Most studies were moderate to high quality. However, methodology and stroke characteristics (e.g., stroke topography, stroke severity) were heterogenous thereby limiting generalisable conclusions. Furthermore, a priori neuroimaging outcomes in conjunction with sleep and circadian features were seldom assessed. The clinical pathogenic implications and methodological limitations of studies are discussed, and a research agenda for future studies is outlined."
"In mammals, the rhythmic secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland is driven by the circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. The robust nightly peak of melatonin secretion is an output signal of the circadian clock and is supposed to deliver the circadian message to the whole of the organism. Since the circadian system regulates many behavioral and physiological processes, its disruption by external (shift-work, jet-lag) or internal desynchronization (blindness, aging) causes many different health problems. Externally applied melatonin is used in humans as a chronobiotic drug to treat desynchronization and circadian disorders, and the success of these treatments does, at first glance, underline the supposed pivotal role of melatonin in the synchronization of the circadian system. On the other hand, pinealectomy in experimental animals and humans does not abolish their rhythms of rest and activity. Furthermore, mice with deficient melatoninergic systems neither display overt defects in their rhythmic behavior nor do they show obvious signs of disease susceptibility, let alone premature mortality. During the last years, our laboratory has investigated several mouse stains with intact or compromised internal melatonin signaling systems in order to better understand the physiological role of the melatoninergic system. These and other investigations which will be reviewed in the present contribution confirm the synchronizing effect of endogenous melatonin and the melatoninergic system. However, these effects are subtle. Thus melatonin does not appear as the master of internal synchronization, but as one component in a cocktail of synchronizing agents."
"In mammals, circadian rhythms in peripheral organs are impaired when animals are maintained in abnormal environmental light-dark cycles such as constant light (LL). This conclusion is based on averaged data from groups of experimental animals sacrificed at each time point. To investigate the effect of LL housing on the peripheral clocks of individual mice, an in vivo imaging system was used to observe the circadian bioluminescence rhythm in peripheral tissues of the liver, kidney, and submandibular salivary gland in PER2::LUCIFERASE knock-in mice. Using this technique, we demonstrated that the majority of individual peripheral tissues still had rhythmic oscillations of their circadian clocks in LL conditions. However, LL housing caused decreased amplitudes and a broad distribution of peak phases in PER2::LUCIFERASE oscillations irrespective of the state of the animals' behavioral rhythmicity. Because both scheduled feeding and scheduled exercise are effective recovery stimuli for circadian clock deficits, we examined whether scheduled feeding or scheduled exercise could reverse this impairment. The results showed that scheduled feeding or exercise could not restore the amplitude of peripheral clocks in LL. On the other hand, the LL-induced broad phase distribution was reversed, and peak phases were entrained to a specific time point by scheduled feeding but only slightly by scheduled exercise. The present results demonstrate that LL housing impairs peripheral circadian clock oscillations by altering both amplitude and phase in individual mice. The broad distribution of clock phases was clearly reversed by scheduled feeding, suggesting the importance of scheduled feeding as an entraining stimulus for impaired peripheral clocks."
"Purpose: Intraocular pressure (IOP) fluctuates with a robust circadian rhythm, which is synchronized to organismal rhythmicity through the master circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei. The mechanisms maintaining circadian synchrony between the suprachiasmatic nuclei and IOP rhythms are presently unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the necessity and sufficiency of adrenal and glucocorticoid function for the entrainment of iris-ciliary body (iris-CB) and IOP circadian rhythms in mice. Methods: Iris-CB complexes were dissected from C57Bl/6J mice that were kept in 12-hour light/dark cycles at 3-hour intervals, and their core clock gene (Per1, Per2, and Bmal1) and glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression were quantified. Iris-CB complexes from period2::luciferase mice were dissected and cultured to measure in vitro rhythmicity. To determine the phase-shifting effect of glucocorticoids on the iris-CB, dexamethasone or vehicle was added to the cultured tissues at defined circadian phases. The diurnal IOP rhythms of adrenalectomized or sham-operated mice under the 12-hour light/dark cycles were also measured. Results: In iris-CB complexes, glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression remained stable throughout the day, whereas the mRNA of core clock genes showed a robust circadian rhythmicity. Dexamethasone significantly induced phase-delays when administered between circadian time 8 (CT8) to CT12 and phase-advance when given between CT16 to CT20. Adrenalectomy abolished circadian IOP rhythmicity, particularly diminishing nocturnal IOP elevation compared with sham-operated mice. Conclusions: Glucocorticoids are sufficient for phase shifting the circadian clock in iris-CB. Intact adrenal function is required for manifest circadian rhythms of IOP in mice. Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that glucocorticoids mediate circadian entrainment of IOP to the master circadian oscillator."
