"We examined the effects of burnout and vigor on the incidence of hyperlipidemia. Based on the bivariate theoretical approach to negative and positive affects and on past studies on the prediction of blood lipids by burnout and vigor, we expected increases from Time 1 (T1) to Time 2 (T2) in burnout levels to be associated with an increase in the risk for hyperlipidemia and T1-T2 increases in vigor levels to be associated with a decrease in the risk of hyperlipidemia. Our sample consisted of 3,337 healthy employees (2,214 men and 1,123 women) who were followed up for about 27 months on average. Burnout and vigor were assessed by well-validated multiple-item instruments. We used logistic regressions and controlled for variables associated with blood lipids as well as with vigor and burnout. We cross-validated all self-reported hyperlipidemia by their T2 lipids levels. As expected, we found that T1-T2 increases in vigor levels were associated with a decreased risk of hyperlipidemia. However, the T1-T2 change in burnout levels was marginally significant (p = .06) in predicting hyperlipidemia. We consider our finding that vigor and burnout are independently associated with the risk of hyperlipidemia as providing support for the bivariate approach to affective states. In addition, our major finding suggests a possible mechanism via which vigor influences physical health outcomes."
"Affective states have become a central topic of interest in research on organizational behavior. Recently, scholars have been paying more attention to the proposals of the Circumplex Model (Russell, 1980) in order to gain a finer grained understanding of job-related affect. However, the limited availability of well-validated measures to test this model in work settings, particularly in non English-speaking populations, is still a major drawback. Using three samples of English-speaking and Spanish-speaking workers, this article offers the cross-validation of the Multi-Affect Indicator (Warr, 2007) between the original English version and its corresponding translation into Spanish. Multi-group Structural Equation Modeling supported the instrument's structure and its invariance between the two languages (English: chi2 = 65.56, df = 48, p = .05; RMSEA = .06; CFI = .97; Spanish: chi2 = 68.68, df = 48, p = .03; RMSEA = .05; CFI = .97). Furthermore, Circular Stochastic Modeling supported the theoretically proposed circumplex representation (chi2 = 139.85, df = 51, p < .01; chi2/df = 2.74, RMSEA = .06). Thus, this study offers an instrument that provides a more accurate approximation to affect at work, both in English and in another of the major language communities in the world, the Spanish-speaking population."
"BACKGROUND: Human parental care relies heavily on the ability to monitor and respond to a child's affective states. The current study examined pupil diameter as a potential physiological index of mothers' affective response to infant facial expressions. METHODS: Pupillary time-series were measured from 86 mothers of young infants in response to an array of photographic infant faces falling into four emotive categories based on valence (positive vs. negative) and arousal (mild vs. strong). RESULTS: Pupil dilation was highly sensitive to the valence of facial expressions, being larger for negative vs. positive facial expressions. A separate control experiment with luminance-matched non-face stimuli indicated that the valence effect was specific to facial expressions and cannot be explained by luminance confounds. Pupil response was not sensitive to the arousal level of facial expressions. CONCLUSIONS: The results show the feasibility of using pupil diameter as a marker of mothers' affective responses to ecologically valid infant stimuli and point to a particularly prompt maternal response to infant distress cues."
"Considerable research has investigated how affect influences performance on a single task; however, little is known about the role of affect in complex multitasking environments. In this paper, 178 participants multitasked in a synthetic work environment (SYNWORK) consisting of memory, visual monitoring, auditory monitoring, and math tasks. Participants multitasked for a 3-min baseline phase (MT1), following which they were randomly assigned to watch one of three affect-induction videos: positive, neutral, or negative. Participants then resumed multitasking for two additional critical phases (MT2, MT3; 3min each). In MT2, performance of the positive and neutral conditions was statistically equivalent and higher than the negative condition. In MT3, the positive condition performed better than the negative condition, with the neutral condition not significantly different from the other two. The differences in overall multitasking scores were largely driven by errors in the Math task (the most cognitively demanding task) in MT2 and the Memory task in MT3. These findings have implications for how positive and negative affective states influence processing in a cognitively demanding multitasking environment."
"Functional and phenotypic immunological parameters were examined immediately before, after, and 30 minutes after experimentally-induced short-term positive (happiness) and negative (anxiety, depression) affective states and a neutral state, in five healthy subjects. Results indicated that all affective states induced more immune fluctuations (regardless of the direction) than the neutral state. Furthermore, among the affective states, anxiety induced the most immunological variability and depression the least."
"Previous research into scratch card gambling has highlighted the effects of these games on players' arousal and affective states. Specifically, near-miss outcomes in scratch cards (uncovering 2 of 3 needed jackpot symbols) have been associated with high levels of physiological and subjective arousal and negative emotional evaluations, including increased frustration. We sought to extend this research by examining whether near-misses prompted increases in gambling urge, and the subsequent purchasing of additional scratch cards. Participants played two scratch cards with varying outcomes with half of the sample experiencing a near-miss for the jackpot prize, and the other half experiencing a regular loss. Players rated their urge to continue gambling after each game outcome, and following the initial playing phase, were then able to use their winnings to purchase additional cards. Our results indicated that near-misses increased the urge to gamble significantly more than regular losses, and urge to gamble in the near-miss group was significantly correlated with purchasing at least one additional card. Although some players in the loss group purchased another card, there was no correlation between urge to gamble and purchasing in this group. Additionally, participants in the near-miss group who purchased additional cards reported higher levels of urge than those who did not purchase more cards. This was not true for the loss group: participants who experienced solely losing outcomes reported similar levels of urge regardless of whether or not they purchased more scratch cards. Despite near-misses' objective status as monetary losses, the increased urge that follows near-miss outcomes may translate into further scratch card gambling for a subset of individuals ."
"Physical activity is known to preserve both physical and mental health. However, the physical activity levels of a large proportion of adolescents are insufficient. This is critical, since physical activity levels in youth have been shown to translate into adulthood. Whereas in adult populations, mood has been supposed to be one important psychological factor that drives physical activity in everyday life, this issue has been poorly studied in adolescent populations. Ambulatory Assessment is the state-of-the-art approach to investigate how mood and non-exercise activity fluctuate within persons in everyday life. Through assessments in real time and real life, this method provides ecological validity, bypassing several limitations of traditional assessment methods (e.g., recall biases). To investigate whether mood is associated with non-exercise activity in adolescents, we equipped a community-based sample comprising 113 participants, aged 12-17 years, with GPS-triggered e-diaries querying for valence, energetic arousal, and calmness, and with accelerometers continuously measuring physical activity in their everyday lives for 1 week. We excluded all acceleration data due to participants' exercise activities and thereafter we parameterized non-exercise activity as the mean value across 10-min intervals of movement acceleration intensity following each e-diary prompt. We used multilevel analyses to compute the effects of the mood dimensions on non-exercise activity within 10-min intervals directly following each e-diary prompt. Additionally, we conducted explorative analyses of the time course of the effects, i.e., on different timeframes of non-exercise activity up to 300 min following the mood assessment. The results showed that valence (p < 0.001) and energetic arousal (p < 0.001) were positively associated with non-exercise activity within the 10 min interval, whereas calmness (p < 0.001) was negatively associated with non-exercise activity. Specifically, adolescents who felt more content, full of energy, or less calm were more physically active in subsequent timeframes. Overall, our results demonstrate significant associations of mood with non-exercise activity in younger ages and converge with the previously observed association between mood and physical activity in adults. This knowledge on distinct associations of mood-dimensions with non-exercise activity may help to foster physical activity levels in adolescents."
"In this experimental study, we investigated how recalling positive, negative, and affectively neutral autobiographic sexual experiences in their personal history affected the current sexual response of sexually functional male volunteers. Based on an attentional-capacity account of sexual arousal, we predicted that affectively charged autobiographic sexual memory recall, both with negative and positive valence, would negatively impact genital arousal, compared to recalling affectively neutral sexual experiences. We expected that subjective sexual arousal would not be differentially affected by emotional memory valence. We measured subjective and genital response to erotic video fragments in sexually functional volunteers (N = 24) in a within-subjects, repeated-measures design. For the memory manipulation, participants received instructions to visualize and mentally re-experience positive, negative, and neutral sexual episodes from autobiographic memory. Memory instructions were found to result in the expected affective states. As predicted, compared to recalling neutral memory, mean genital response was significantly lower during recalling positive and negative memory. However, contrary to prediction, subjective sexual arousal was affected, when multilevel analysis was performed, including a time effect. The implications of the findings were discussed with respect to the advancement of theory and therapeutic intervention."
"The measurement of anterior electroencephalograph (EEG) asymmetries has become an important standard paradigm for the investigation of affective states and traits. Findings in this area are typically interpreted within the motivational direction model, which suggests a lateralization of approach and withdrawal motivational systems to the left and right anterior region, respectively. However, efforts to compare this widely adopted model with an alternative account-which relates the left anterior region to behavioral activation independent of the direction of behavior (approach or withdrawal) and the right anterior region to goal conflict-induced behavioral inhibition-are rare and inconclusive. Therefore, the authors measured the EEG in a sample of 93 young men during emotional imagery designed to provide a critical test between the 2 models. The results (e.g., a correlation between left anterior activation and withdrawal motivation) favor the alternative model on the basis of the concepts of behavioral activation and behavioral inhibition. In addition, the present study also supports an association of right parietal activation with physiological arousal and the conceptualization of parietal EEG asymmetry as a mediator of emotion-related physiological arousal."
"Empathy entails the ability to recognize emotional states in others and feel for them. Since empathy does not take place in a static setting, paradigms utilizing more naturalistic, dynamic stimuli instead of static stimuli are perhaps more suited to grasp the origin of this highly complex social skill. The study was set up to test the effect of stimulus dynamics and gender on empathic responses. Participants were 80 healthy volunteers (N = 40 males) aged 22.5 years on average. Behavioral empathy was tested with the multifaceted empathy test, including static emotional stimuli, and the multidimensional movie empathy test (MMET), including dynamic stimuli. Findings showed emotional empathy (EE) responses were higher to negative emotional stimuli in both tasks, i.e., using static as well as dynamic stimuli. Interestingly a gender-dependent response was only seen in the MMET using dynamic stimuli. It was shown that females felt more aroused and were more concerned with people in negative affective states. It was concluded that the MMET is suited to study gender differences in EE."
"Everyone is interested in the pursuit of happiness, but the real problem for the researchers is how to measure it. Our aim was to deeply investigate happiness measurement through biomedical signals, using psychophysiological methods to objectify the happiness experiences measurements. The classic valence-arousal model of affective states to study happiness has been extensively used in psychophysiology. However, really few studies considered a real combination of these two dimensions and no study further investigated multidimensional models. More, most studies focused mainly on self-report to measure happiness and a deeper psychophysiological investigation on the dimensions of such an experience is still missing. A multidimensional model of happiness is presented and both the dimensions and the measures extracted within each dimension are comprehensively explained. This multidimensional model aims at being a milestone for future systematic study on psychophysiology of happiness and affective states."
"BACKGROUND: When humans observe other people's emotions they not only can relate but also experience similar affective states. This capability is seen as a precondition for helping and other prosocial behaviors. Our study aims to quantify the influence of help-related picture content on subjectively experienced affect. It also assesses the impact of different scales on the way people rate their emotional state. METHODS: The participants (N=242) of this study were shown stimuli with help-related content. In the first subset, half the drawings depicted a child or a bird needing help to reach a simple goal. The other drawings depicted situations where the goal was achieved. The second subset showed adults either actively helping a child or as passive bystanders. We created control conditions by including pictures of the adults on their own. Participants were asked to report their affective responses to the stimuli using two types of 9-point scales. For one half of the pictures, scales of arousal (calm to excited) and of bipolar valence (unhappy to happy) were employed; for the other half, unipolar scales of pleasantness and unpleasantness (strong to absent) were used. RESULTS: Even non-dramatic depictions of simple need-of-help situations were rated systematically lower in valence, higher in arousal, less pleasant and more unpleasant than corresponding pictures with the child or bird not needing help. The presence of a child and adult together increased pleasantness ratings compared to pictures in which they were depicted alone. Arousal was lower for pictures showing only an adult than for those including a child. Depictions of active helping were rated similarly to pictures showing a passive adult bystander, when the need-of-help was resolved. Aggregated unipolar pleasantness and unpleasantness ratings accounted well for arousal and even better for bipolar valence ratings and for content effects on them. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report upon the meaningful impact of harmless need-of-help content on self-reported emotional experience. It provides the basis for further investigating the links between subjective emotional experience and active prosocial behavior. It also builds upon recent findings on the correspondence between emotional ratings on bipolar and unipolar scales."
"Several behavioral studies have reported a detrimental effect of emotion on reasoning tasks, either when the content of the reasoning and/or the mood state of the individual are emotionally loaded. However, the neural mechanisms involved in this phenomena remain largely unexplored. In an event-related potentials (ERPs) study, we examined the consequences of an induced mood over the electrophysiological signals obtained while processing logical and illogical categorical conclusions. Prior to performing a syllogism reading task, we aimed to induce, by using short film clips, high arousal negative and positive moods and neutral affective states to participants in three separate recording sessions. Our mood induction procedure was only successful at inducing a highly arousing negative state. Behaviorally, participants committed more errors overall while judging the invalidity versus the validity of illogical and logical conclusions, respectively, but no influences from mood state emerged at this logical validity task. Electrophysiologically and overall a negative going N400 deflection was larger for illogical relative to logical conclusions in a parietal region between 300 and 420ms. However, further analysis revealed that the logical conclusions were only more expected (smaller N400 amplitudes) in the negative relative to the neutral and the positive sessions, providing support to theoretical views that posit that a more analytic reasoning style might be implemented under a negative mood state. These results provide further electrophysiological evidence of the influence of mood on other cognitive processes, particularly on the anticipation and processing of logical conclusions during online reasoning tasks."
"The present study had three main objectives. First, we aimed to evaluate whether short-duration affective states induced by negative and positive words can lead to increased error-monitoring activity relative to a neutral task condition. Second, we intended to determine whether such an enhancement is limited to words of specific valence or is a general response to arousing material. Third, we wanted to assess whether post-error brain activity is associated with incidental memory for negative and/or positive words. Participants performed an emotional stop-signal task that required response inhibition to negative, positive or neutral nouns while EEG was recorded. Immediately after the completion of the task, they were instructed to recall as many of the presented words as they could in an unexpected free recall test. We observed significantly greater brain activity in the error-positivity (Pe) time window in both negative and positive trials. The error-related negativity amplitudes were comparable in both the neutral and emotional arousing trials, regardless of their valence. Regarding behavior, increased processing of emotional words was reflected in better incidental recall. Importantly, the memory performance for negative words was positively correlated with the Pe amplitude, particularly in the negative condition. The source localization analysis revealed that the subsequent memory recall for negative words was associated with widespread bilateral brain activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and in the medial frontal gyrus, which was registered in the Pe time window during negative trials. The present study has several important conclusions. First, it indicates that the emotional enhancement of error monitoring, as reflected by the Pe amplitude, may be induced by stimuli with symbolic, ontogenetically learned emotional significance. Second, it indicates that the emotion-related enhancement of the Pe occurs across both negative and positive conditions, thus it is preferentially driven by the arousal content of an affective stimuli. Third, our findings suggest that enhanced error monitoring and facilitated recall of negative words may both reflect responsivity to negative events. More speculatively, they can also indicate that post-error activity of the medial prefrontal cortex may selectively support encoding for negative stimuli and contribute to their privileged access to memory."
"This work aims at showing improved performances of an emotion recognition system embedding information gathered from cardiorespiratory (CR) coupling. Here, we propose a novel methodology able to robustly identify up to 25 regions of a two-dimensional space model, namely the well-known circumplex model of affect (CMA). The novelty of embedding CR coupling information in an autonomic nervous system-based feature space better reveals the sympathetic activations upon emotional stimuli. A CR synchrogram analysis was used to quantify such a coupling in terms of number of heartbeats per respiratory period. Physiological data were gathered from 35 healthy subjects emotionally elicited by means of affective pictures of the international affective picture system database. In this study, we finely detected five levels of arousal and five levels of valence as well as the neutral state, whose combinations were used for identifying 25 different affective states in the CMA plane. We show that the inclusion of the bivariate CR measures in a previously developed system based only on monovariate measures of heart rate variability, respiration dynamics and electrodermal response dramatically increases the recognition accuracy of a quadratic discriminant classifier, obtaining more than 90% of correct classification per class. Finally, we propose a comprehensive description of the CR coupling during sympathetic elicitation adapting an existing theoretical nonlinear model with external driving. The theoretical idea behind this model is that the CR system is comprised of weakly coupled self-sustained oscillators that, when exposed to an external perturbation (i.e. sympathetic activity), becomes synchronized and less sensible to input variations. Given the demonstrated role of the CR coupling, this model can constitute a general tool which is easily embedded in other model-based emotion recognition systems."
"Most research focuses on actual affect, or the affective states that people actually feel. In this article, I demonstrate the importance and utility of studying ideal affect, or the affective states that people ideally want to feel. First, I define ideal affect and describe the cultural causes and behavioral consequences of ideal affect. To illustrate these points, I compare American and East Asian cultures, which differ in their valuation of high-arousal positive affective states (e.g., excitement, enthusiasm) and low-arousal positive affective states (e.g., calm, peace-fulness). I then introduce affect valuation theory, which integrates ideal affect with current models of affect and emotion and, in doing so, provides a new framework for understanding how cultural and temperamental factors may shape affect and behavior."
"The quantity of music content is rapidly increasing and automated affective tagging of music video clips can enable the development of intelligent retrieval, music recommendation, automatic playlist generators, and music browsing interfaces tuned to the users' current desires, preferences, or affective states. To achieve this goal, the field of affective computing has emerged, in particular the development of so-called affective brain-computer interfaces, which measure the user's affective state directly from measured brain waves using non-invasive tools, such as electroencephalography (EEG). Typically, conventional features extracted from the EEG signal have been used, such as frequency subband powers and/or inter-hemispheric power asymmetry indices. More recently, the coupling between EEG and peripheral physiological signals, such as the galvanic skin response (GSR), have also been proposed. Here, we show the importance of EEG amplitude modulations and propose several new features that measure the amplitude-amplitude cross-frequency coupling per EEG electrode, as well as linear and non-linear connections between multiple electrode pairs. When tested on a publicly available dataset of music video clips tagged with subjective affective ratings, support vector classifiers trained on the proposed features were shown to outperform those trained on conventional benchmark EEG features by as much as 6, 20, 8, and 7% for arousal, valence, dominance and liking, respectively. Moreover, fusion of the proposed features with EEG-GSR coupling features showed to be particularly useful for arousal (feature-level fusion) and liking (decision-level fusion) prediction. Together, these findings show the importance of the proposed features to characterize human affective states during music clip watching."
"CONTEXT: Chronic pain and depression are highly comorbid conditions, yet little is known about the neurobiological basis of pain processing in major depressive disorder (MDD). OBJECTIVE: To examine the neural substrates underlying anticipation and processing of heat pain in a group of unmedicated young adults with current MDD. DESIGN: Functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging data were collected during an event-related factorial experimental pain paradigm. Painful and nonpainful heat stimuli were applied to the left volar forearm while different color shapes explicitly signaled the intensity of the upcoming stimulus. SETTING: University brain imaging center. Patients Fifteen (12 female) young adults with current MDD and 15 (10 female) healthy subjects with no history of MDD were recruited and matched for age and level of education. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV was administered to all participants by a board-certified psychiatrist. Main Outcome Measure Between-group differences in blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging signal change to anticipation and processing of painful vs nonpainful temperature stimuli. RESULTS: Subjects with MDD compared with healthy controls showed (1) increased activation in the right anterior insular region, dorsal anterior cingulate, and right amygdala during anticipation of painful relative to nonpainful stimuli, (2) increased activation in the right amygdala and decreased activation in periaqueductal gray matter and the rostral anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices during painful stimulation relative to nonpainful stimulation, and (3) greater activation in the right amygdala during anticipation of pain, which was associated with greater levels of perceived helplessness. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that increased emotional reactivity during the anticipation of heat pain may lead to an impaired ability to modulate pain experience in MDD. Future studies should examine the degree to which altered functional brain response during anticipatory processing affects the ability to modulate negative affective states in MDD, which is a core characteristic of this disorder."
"Patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) have been shown to exhibit increased thresholds towards experimentally induced thermal pain applied to the skin. In contrast, the induction of sad mood can increase pain perception in healthy controls. Here, we aimed to test the hypothesis that heat pain thresholds are further increased after sad mood induction in depressed patients. Thermal pain thresholds were obtained from 25 female depressed patients and 25 controls before and after sad mood induction applying a modified Velten Mood Induction procedure (MIP). Valence and arousal ratings were obtained using the self-assessment manikin. The Montgomery Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were obtained at baseline from all participants. Pain thresholds at baseline did not significantly differ between groups. Pain thresholds and valence of mood significantly decreased both in patients and controls, while arousal showed an inverse time course between groups. Therefore, our hypothesis could not be confirmed. From these data, we propose that the depressed mood as seen in MDD patients influences pain experience differently as compared to the shorter-lasting mood change after MIP. A differential interaction of both affective states with brain areas of the pain matrix might be assumed. Eventually, the induction of sad mood might mirror the increased number of pain complaints in depressed patients and thus adds to the current concept of adjuvant antidepressant treatment both in depressed patients with pain complaints and in chronic pain patients."
"Affective Computing has emerged as an important field of study that aims to develop systems that can automatically recognize emotions. Up to the present, elicitation has been carried out with non-immersive stimuli. This study, on the other hand, aims to develop an emotion recognition system for affective states evoked through Immersive Virtual Environments. Four alternative virtual rooms were designed to elicit four possible arousal-valence combinations, as described in each quadrant of the Circumplex Model of Affects. An experiment involving the recording of the electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) of sixty participants was carried out. A set of features was extracted from these signals using various state-of-the-art metrics that quantify brain and cardiovascular linear and nonlinear dynamics, which were input into a Support Vector Machine classifier to predict the subject's arousal and valence perception. The model's accuracy was 75.00% along the arousal dimension and 71.21% along the valence dimension. Our findings validate the use of Immersive Virtual Environments to elicit and automatically recognize different emotional states from neural and cardiac dynamics; this development could have novel applications in fields as diverse as Architecture, Health, Education and Videogames."
"This study was conducted as a pilot test case to investigate potential behavioral and neural indicators of positive emotional states in dogs. These states were induced by subjecting each dog to three types of human interactions (verbal contact only, physical contact only, or both). Each stimulus was repeated 10 times, at 1-min intervals, alternating with a baseline phase (no interaction) while behavior was observed and frontal cortical brain activation was recorded by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Dogs reacted similarly to all 3 stimuli with a consistent hemodynamic pattern. Regarding behavior, dogs lay on their back, explored the handler and performed lip-licking more during exposure to the stimuli than during the baseline. There was only weak evidence that the dogs' behavioral reactions differed between the 3 stimuli, but their behavior changed markedly with repetition. For example, the proportion of time a dog spent lying with its head resting on the floor increased, whereas the probability of exploring the handler and the proportion of time spent lip-licking decreased over time. In contrast, the hemodynamic reaction did not change with repetition. The dogs' reactions are consistent with the stimuli being positive. The contrast between the changes in behavior with repetition and the consistency of the hemodynamic frontal cortical reaction would be in keeping with the assumption that there was a decrease in arousal as dogs habituated to the repetitions, reflected by their change in behavior, whereas because the valence of the stimuli remains constant, there was no change in the frontal hemodynamic reaction."
"The objective of this study is to investigate the synchronization between breathing patterns and heart rate during emotional visual elicitation, that is, using sets of images gathered from the international affective picture system having five levels of arousal and five levels of valence, including a neutral reference level. Thirty-five healthy volunteers were emotionally elicited in agreement with a bidimensional spatial localization of affective states, i.e., arousal/valence plane, while two peripheral physiological signals, ECG and Respiration activity, were acquired simultaneously. The synchronization was then quantified by applying the concept of phase synchronization of chaotic oscillators, i.e., the cardio-respiratory synchrogram. This technique allowed us to estimate the synchronization ratio m:n as the attendance of n heartbeats in each m respiratory cycle, even for noisy and nonstationary data. We found a stronger evidence of cardiorespiratory synchronization during arousal than during neutral states."
"OBJECTIVE: Induction of negative affective states can enhance bodily symptoms in high habitual symptom reporters among healthy persons and in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The aims of this study were to replicate this effect in patients with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome and to investigate the role of moderators, focusing on alexithymia, negative affectivity, and absorption. METHODS: Patients with fibromyalgia and/or chronic fatigue syndrome (n = 81) and HCs (n = 41) viewed series of neutral, positive, and negative affective pictures. After every picture series, participants filled out a somatic symptom checklist and rated emotions experienced during the picture series on valence, arousal, and perceived control. RESULTS: Patients reported more somatic symptoms after viewing negative pictures (least square mean [LSM] = 19.40, standard error (SE) = 0.50) compared with neutral (LSM = 17.59, SE = 0.42, p < .001) or positive (LSM = 17.04, SE = 0.41, p < .001) pictures, whereas somatic symptom ratings of HCs after viewing negative picture series (LSM = 12.07, SE = 0.71) did not differ from ratings after viewing neutral (LSM = 11.07, SE = 0.59, p = .065) or positive (LSM = 11.10, SE = 0.58, p = .93) pictures. Negative affectivity did not moderate the symptom-enhancing effect of negative affective pictures, whereas the alexithymia factor ""difficulty identifying feelings"" and absorption did (p = .016 and p = .006, respectively). CONCLUSION: Negative affective states elicit elevated somatic symptom reports in patients experiencing fibromyalgia and/or chronic fatigue syndrome. This symptom-enhancing effect is greater in patients having higher difficulty to identify feelings and higher absorption scores. The results are discussed in a predictive coding framework of symptom perception."
"Cognitive conflict plays an important role in tuning cognitive control to the situation at hand. On the basis of earlier findings demonstrating emotional modulations of conflict processing, we predicted that affective states may adaptively regulate goal-directed behavior that is driven by conflict. We tested this hypothesis by measuring conflict-driven control adaptations following experimental induction of four different mood states that could be differentiated along the dimensions of arousal and pleasure. After mood states were induced, 91 subjects performed a flanker task, which provided a measure of conflict adaptation. As predicted, pleasure level affected conflict adaptation: Less pleasure was associated with more conflict-driven control. Arousal level did not influence conflict adaptation. This study suggests that affect adaptively regulates cognitive control. Implications for future research and psychopathology are discussed."
"Emotion-aware consumer products require reliable, short-term emotion assessment (i.e., unobtrusive, robust, and lacking calibration). To explore the feasibility of this, an experiment was conducted where the galvanic skin response (GSR) and three electromyography (EMG) signals (frontalis, corrugator supercilii, and zygomaticus major) were recorded on 24 participants who watched eight 2-min emotion inducing film fragments. The unfiltered psychophysiological signals were processed and six statistical parameters (i.e., mean, absolute deviation, standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis) were derived for each 10-s interval of the film fragment. For each physiological signal, skewness and kurtosis discriminated among affective states, accompanied by other parameters, depending on the signal. The skewness parameter also showed to indicate mixed emotions. Moreover, a mapping of events in the fragments on the signals showed the importance of short-term emotion assessment. Hence, this research identified generic features, denoted important considerations, and illustrated the feasibility of emotion-aware consumer products."
"BACKGROUND: We investigated how accurately physicians judge colleagues' states during shift handovers on intensive-care units, the role of physician characteristics, and how accuracy is related to handover partners' satisfaction. METHODS: Using mobile phones, we assessed momentary judgements during N = 272 shift handovers by 36 physicians of five Swiss clinics. Physicians rated their own and their partner's affective states. We calculated the covariation of the perceiver's judgements of the partner's affect with the partner's self-reported affect and the perceiver's own self-reported affect. We then examined the moderation of these covariations by physicians' roles and experience. RESULTS: Overall, resident physicians were moderately successful in taking their counterparts' perspective: Perceiver's ratings of partner's affect and the latter's self-ratings were significantly related. Associations between perceivers' ratings of their own and their partner's affect were also evident. None of the effects varied as a function of physicians' roles. There was an unexpected effect of job experience; physicians with more experience were more likely to project their own affect into the rating of partner's affect. Physicians' accuracy in judging the partner's tense arousal was related to the partner's satisfaction with the social interaction. This effect may have been mainly driven by instances in which low tension was accurately judged, however."
"Tests for attention bias potentially offer more rapid assessment of affective state in animals than existing cognitive methods. An attention bias test has previously been developed for sheep and validated as a measure of anxious states. The 3 minute test assessed behavioural responses of sheep in an enclosed arena after brief exposure to the threat of a dog. Experiment 1 of the current study aimed to refine the previously developed method, removing the need for a habituation period and shortening the test duration. Sheep were given either an anxiolytic drug, an anxiogenic drug or a control treatment prior to testing to induce contrasting affective states. Differences in behaviour were found between the treatment groups within the first 45s of the test, indicating the original test duration could be shortened from 180 s. During testing, 36 of 40 animals in the control and anxiolytic groups ate the novel feed offered in the test, indicating it is not necessary to habituate animals to a feed container. Experiment 2 aimed to confirm the responses measured in the test were primarily towards the dog rather than other aspects of the test environment. Sheep exposed to an empty window at the beginning of the test behaved differently to those which were exposed to a dog, indicating sheep behaviour in the test is at least partially a response to the dog. A third group of sheep were also tested with the dog immediately after having small data loggers attached to their necks. Behaviour of these sheep did not differ from the sheep tested without loggers, indicating data logger attachment did not impact their behaviour in the test. In both experiments, treatments did not appear to modify activity (zones crossed), which we propose indicates the test was primarily detecting valence of the affective state rather than arousal."
"BACKGROUND: Maternal sensitive behavior depends on recognizing one's own child's affective states. The present study investigated distinct and overlapping neural responses of mothers to sad and happy facial expressions of their own child (in comparison to facial expressions of an unfamiliar child). METHODS: We used functional MRI to measure dissociable and overlapping activation patterns in 27 healthy mothers in response to happy, neutral and sad facial expressions of their own school-aged child and a gender- and age-matched unfamiliar child. To investigate differential activation to sad compared to happy faces of one's own child, we used interaction contrasts. During the scan, mothers had to indicate the affect of the presented face. After scanning, they were asked to rate the perceived emotional arousal and valence levels for each face using a 7-point Likert-scale (adapted SAM version). RESULTS: While viewing their own child's sad faces, mothers showed activation in the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex whereas happy facial expressions of the own child elicited activation in the hippocampus. Conjoint activation in response to one's own child happy and sad expressions was found in the insula and the superior temporal gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal brain activations differed depending on the child's affective state. Sad faces of the own child activated areas commonly associated with a threat detection network, whereas happy faces activated reward related brain areas. Overlapping activation was found in empathy related networks. These distinct neural activation patterns might facilitate sensitive maternal behavior."
"Pupil dilation (PD) dynamics reflect the interactions of sympathetic and parasympathetic innervations in the iris muscle. Different pupillary responses have been observed with respect to emotionally characterized stimuli. Evidences of the correlation between PD and respiration, heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure (BP) are present in literature, making the pupil dilation a candidate for estimating the activity state of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS), in particular during stressful and/or emotionally characterized stimuli. The aim of this study is to investigate whether both slow and fast PD dynamics can be addressed to characterized different affective states. Two different frequency bands were considered: the classical autonomic band [0-0.45] Hz and a very high frequency (VHF) band [0.45-5] Hz. The pupil dilation signals from 13 normal subjects were recorded during a psychological protocol suitable to evoke particular affective states. An elaborate reconstruction of the missing data (blink events and artifacts) was performed to obtain a more reliable signal, particularly in the VHF band. Results show a high correlation between the arousal of the event and the power characteristics of the signal, in all frequencies. In particular, for the ""Anger"" condition, we can observe 10 indices out of 13 significantly different with respect to ""Baseline"" counterparts. These preliminary results suggest that both slow and fast oscillations of the PD can be used to characterize affective states."
"Alexithymia is a sub-clinical construct, traditionally characterized by difficulties identifying and describing one's own emotions. Despite the clear need for interoception (interpreting physical signals from the body) when identifying one's own emotions, little research has focused on the selectivity of this impairment. While it was originally assumed that the interoceptive deficit in alexithymia is specific to emotion, recent evidence suggests that alexithymia may also be associated with difficulties perceiving some non-affective interoceptive signals, such as one's heart rate. It is therefore possible that the impairment experienced by those with alexithymia is common to all aspects of interoception, such as interpreting signals of hunger, arousal, proprioception, tiredness and temperature. In order to determine whether alexithymia is associated with selectively impaired affective interoception, or general interoceptive impairment, we investigated the association between alexithymia and self-reported non-affective interoceptive ability, and the extent to which individuals perceive similarity between affective and non-affective states (both measured using questionnaires developed for the purpose of the current study), in both typical individuals (n = 105 (89 female), mean age = 27.5 years) and individuals reporting a diagnosis of a psychiatric condition (n = 103 (83 female), mean age = 31.3 years). Findings indicated that alexithymia was associated with poor non-affective interoception and increased perceived similarity between affective and non-affective states, in both the typical and clinical populations. We therefore suggest that rather than being specifically associated with affective impairment, alexithymia is better characterized by a general failure of interoception."
"In the framework of models on the lateralized involvement of the cortical hemispheres in affect and psychopathology, the authors examined whether cognitive processes associated with the left and the right prefrontal cortex varied as a function of valence, motivational direction, or intensity of induced mood. Affective states (cheerfulness, anxiety, sadness, anger, and neutral mood) were experimentally induced by short ""emotionally contagious films."" Findings confirmed that the newly developed films were suitable to effectively elicit the expected affective states and to differentially change the dimensions of interest. Changes in verbal versus figural fluency performance were examined as a function of positive versus negative valence, approach versus withdrawal motivation, and low versus high emotional arousal. Level of interest was evaluated as a control. Both the tendency to withdraw and emotional arousal seemed to produce relative advantages for cognitive processes that are more strongly represented in the right than left prefrontal cortex. Findings suggest that changes in cognitive performance might be best explained by an additive combination of motivational direction and arousal."
"Guided by Damasio's (2003) formulations on background emotions, this study examined the contour of infant affect during interactions with mother and father in relation to the emergence of symbolic expression. One hundred parents and infants were observed in face-to-face interactions and in play sessions at the toddler stage. Parent's and infants' affective states were coded in 1-s frames, and synchrony was assessed. Toddlers' play was microcoded for symbolic level and for reciprocity and intrusiveness. Infant affective contour with mother was rhythmic with 1 episode of positive arousal framed by social gaze. Affective contour with father contained several peaks of positive arousal of shorter duration. Symbolic complexity was comparable and preserved the parent-specific contours, with quicker latencies, higher frequencies, and shorter durations of complex symbolic episodes with father. Sequential relations emerged between parent's and child's symbolic expression, and maternal reciprocity and intrusiveness were sequentially linked to symbolic expansion or constriction, respectively. Parent-infant synchrony and the parent's support of toddler symbolic play predicted symbolic complexity. The need to include time in research on emotions and the dyadic origins of positive emotions are discussed."
"The primary aim of this study was to examine whether smoking to reduce negative affect was uniquely related to a range of affective vulnerability factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, anxious arousal, and negative affectivity) among daily smokers. Participants were 276 young adult daily smokers (124 females; M(age)=25.12, SD=10.37). Partially consistent with prediction, the motivation to smoke to reduce negative affect was significantly related to anxiety sensitivity and negative affectivity, but not anxious arousal; the observed significant effects were above and beyond other theoretically relevant factors (e.g., smoking rate, years smoked, age, gender). In contrast to prediction, habitual smoking motives demonstrated significant incremental associations with anxiety sensitivity and anxious arousal symptoms. These results suggest that there are important associations between certain smoking motives and negative affective states and that such relations are not attributable to other smoking factors (e.g., smoking rate)."
"Recent literature has recognized the advantageous role of low-arousal positive affect such as feelings of peacefulness and internal harmony in collectivist cultures. However, limited research has explored the benefits of low-arousal affective states in the educational setting. The current study examined the link of peace of mind (PoM) to academic motivation (i.e., amotivation, controlled motivation, and autonomous motivation) and academic achievement among 525 Filipino high school students. Findings revealed that PoM was positively associated with academic achievement beta = .16, p < .05, autonomous motivation beta = .48, p < .001, and controlled motivation beta = .25, p < .01. As expected, PoM was negatively related to amotivation beta = -.19, p < .05, and autonomous motivation was positively associated with academic achievement beta = .52, p < .01. Furthermore, the results of bias-corrected bootstrap analyses at 95% confidence interval based on 5,000 bootstrapped resamples demonstrated that peace of mind had an indirect influence on academic achievement through the mediating effects of autonomous motivation. In terms of the effect sizes, the findings showed that PoM explained about 1% to 18% of the variance in academic achievement and motivation. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are elucidated."
"In the present study, we examined mood changes following dancing. Previous works suggested that contextual factors may influence affective states; it has been shown that changes in mood following competition differ from those following recreational exercise. The study has been conducted in Warsaw, Poland. Mood was assessed before and after dance activity in three groups of ballroom dancers: recreational (n = 32) and competitive (n = 38) dancers doing ordinary training and competitive dancers taking part in a dance competition (n = 35). We observed a moderately positive change in recreational dancers doing ordinary training; they reported higher energetic arousal (EA) and hedonic tone (HT) and lower tense arousal (TA) after dance activity. In comparison dancers taking part in a competition were higher on TA before dancing and felt less pleasure after dancing than recreational and competitive dancers doing ordinary training; HT, TA and EA moderately decreased during competition. In general, the current study suggests that dance can elicit changes in mood; however, situational context has to be taken into consideration when explaining the influence of dance on mood."
"Interoception, the perception and interpretation of one's own bodily signals, is a key aspect of human caregiving that impacts infant health and well-being across life. Interoception relies on limbic structures, mainly the amygdala, and the agranular visceromotor cortex, particularly the anterior insula (AI), that integrate with the oxytocin (OT) system to support interoceptive sensitivity. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine whether interoception sensitivity in the parent's brain during the first months of parenting combines with sensitive parenting and OT-system functionality to predict children's somatic symptoms six years later. We followed 45 primary-caregiving first-time mothers and fathers and their infants across the first six years of parenting. In infancy (Time 1), parents' brain response to infant stimuli was imaged, salivary OT measured, and parent-infant interactions coded for parent sensitivity. In preschool (Time 2), parent and child's OT and parent sensitivity were measured again. At six years (Time 3), parents reported on children's somatic symptoms. Greater activation of the parent's AI bilaterally when his/her child was an infant predicted lower child somatic problems at six years. Parent sensitivity partially mediated the links between parental AI activation and child somatic symptoms. In addition, greater parental bilateral amygdala activity predicted higher child OT levels at 3 years and parental OT moderated the relations between preschoolers' OT and later somatic symptoms. Our findings chart two independent cross-generational pathways from interoception sensitivity in the parent's brain and child somatization. The first defines an evolutionary-ancient path including the amygdala and the OT system that support mammalian attention to arousal modulations in response to social cues; the second, via the AI, implicates higher-order interoceptive representations of bodily responses and affective states that underpins human embodiment."
"Prior research linking job stressors to psychological strains has been limited to a small number of emotional reactions. This article describes research linking job stressors to a wide range of affective states at work. In Study 1, a multidimensional scaling procedure was used on a matrix of similarity judgments by 51 employees of 56 job-related affective statements to support a 2-dimensional view of affective well-being. In Study 2, ratings of the affect statements by 100 employees further supported the contention that the dimensions were pleasure-displeasure and degree of arousal. In Study 3, 114 full-time university employees responded to the Job-Related Affective Well-Being Scale, which was found to be related to measures of job stressors as well as job satisfaction and physical symptoms."
"The dimensional structure of emotion was investigated using self reports of induced mood and idiographic and nomothetic analyses. Subjects attended four experimental sessions during which an array of affective states was induced via auditory, visual, and imaginal channels. For each of 118 stimulus events, subjects self-rated their response. Factor analysis yielded the predicted bipolar factors of valence and arousal: these were obtained in group-aggregated analysis and subsequently confirmed as change dimensions at the intraindividual level. Controversy over the fundamental dimensions of affective space was considered with respect to methodological issues such as factor rotation and sampling of data space. Valence and arousal are discussed as motivational, driving parameters of affective experience and a dynamical systems conceptualization of emotion is proposed."
"In this study, modulation of spinal tendinous (T) reflexes by sexual stimulation was investigated. T reflexes are augmented in states of appetitive and defensive action and modified by differences in arousal intensity. Reflexes were expected to be facilitated by both pleasant (sexual) and unpleasant (anxiety) stimuli. Subjects were exposed to a sexual, an anxiety-inducing, a sexually threatening, and a neutral film excerpt. Genital arousal, emotional experience, subjective action tendencies, and T reflexes were monitored. Self-report and genital data confirmed the affective states as intended. T reflex amplitude significantly increased during viewing of emotionally arousing film excerpts as compared with a neutral film excerpt. T reflexes were facilitated by the sex stimulus to the same extent as by the anxiety and sexual threat stimuli. The results support the view of sexual arousal as an emotional state, generating sex-specific autonomic and general somatic motor system responses, which prepare the organism for action."
"This study examined the influence of hypnosis, autogenic relaxation, and quiet rest on selected affective states and metabolism. The influence of body position (seated vs. supine) on these same outcome measures was also investigated. Anxiety, tension, and overall mood were assessed before and 30 minutes after each treatment, and oxygen uptake was measured continuously. State anxiety, tension, and a general measure of mood were reduced significantly following each intervention, but oxygen uptake did not change with the exception of small, transient alterations during the physical challenges performed in the hypnosis condition. It is concluded that administration of a routine hypnosis induction to healthy individuals results in a reduction of state anxiety and an improvement of mood commensurate with effects achieved by autogenic training and quiet rest, and these effects occur in both the supine and seated position."
"This study examined physiological, affective, and contextual components of female sexual responsiveness and satisfaction. Fifty-five women, aged 21 to 58, 27 of whom were married participated in two psychophysiological laboratory sessions and completed a questionnaire. During each laboratory session, physiological and self-reported sexual arousal were measured in response to an erotic tape, film, and self-generated fantasies. Vaginal pulse amplitude responses showed married women to be less aroused to erotic materials during session 1 but not session 2. Self-reported sexual arousal was correlated with vaginal response only in the unmarried sample and only during the tape and film of session 1. Subjectively reported sexual arousal was also correlated with a constellation of positive affective states. Generally, negative correlations were found between vaginal response in the laboratory and reported sexual responsiveness at home. The patterning of the affective-physiological relationships suggests several interpretations with regard to female sexuality and models to human emotion."
"To more clearly characterize the patterns of cognitive-affective and physiological responses concomitant with male sexual dysfunction, the present study compared 14 sexually dysfunctional and 16 sexually functional men. All individuals listened to two sexually explicit tapes and engaged in a self-generated fantasy, while genital, heart rate and scaled cognitive affective responses were recorded. Two types of instructions, a performance demand set and a non-demand sensate focus set, preceded the erotic tapes in counterbalanced order. As predicted, dysfunctional men showed less genital tumescence to tapes preceded by the demand than the non-demand instructions. Contrary to expectation, functional men showed greater penile tumescence to the tapes preceded by demand instructions. Self-reported sexual arousal did not follow the penile tumescence pattern but instead indicated that the dysfunctional sample was significantly less subjectively aroused to the tapes and fantasy. There were other significant differences between the groups. Dysfunctional men showed greater general psychological distress, as measured by the SCL-90, including elevated somaticism, anxiety and depression scores. During the experimental session, dysfunctional men also evidenced greater awareness of a variety of physiological responses, as well as more negative and fewer positive cognitive-affective states. These data are discussed in terms of the interaction of affective and physiological responses, differences in contextual meanings of instructional sets given the presence of a dysfunction, and theoretical and clinical conceptualizations of male sexual functioning."
"Found the MAACL, the Anxiety, Depression and Hostility subscales to be intercorrelated in two independent studies (N = 84), thus raising doubts about their validity as measures of separate affective states. It is suggested that the scores of the subscales may usefully be summed to produce a measure of general negative affect."
"A few Parkinson patients develop a disabling pattern of compulsive dopaminergic drug use (""dopamine dysregulation syndrome""-DDS). DDS patients commonly identify aversive dysphoric ""OFF"" mood-states as a primary motivation to compulsively use their drugs. We compared motoric, affective, non-motor symptoms and incentive arousal after overnight medication withdrawal and after levodopa in DDS and control PD patients. Twenty DDS patients were matched to 20 control PD patients for age, gender, and disease duration and underwent a standard levodopa challenge. Somatic symptomatology, positive and negative affective states, drug effects, reward responsivity, motor disability, and dyskinesias were tested in the ""OFF""-state after overnight withdrawal of medications, and then after a challenge with a standard dose of levodopa, after a full ""ON""-state was achieved. In the ""OFF""-state, DDS patients reported lower positive affect, and more motor and non-motor disability. In the ""ON""-state, DDS patients had higher expressions of drug ""wanting,"" reward responsivity, and dyskinesias. Positive and negative affect, non-motor symptomatology, and motor disability were comparable. These findings suggest that affective, motivational, and motoric disturbances in PD are associated with the transition to compulsive drug use in individuals who inappropriately overuse their dopaminergic medication."
"Recent evidence suggests an important role for hypothalamic orexins/hypocretins in modulation of drug reward and addiction-like behaviors in rodents. Our recent study has shown that the aversive state of arousal during acute morphine withdrawal is associated with increased orexin gene expression in lateral hypothalamus (LH) of Fischer 344 (F344) inbred rats, with no change in the expression of preprodynorphin (ppDyn), a gene co-expressed with LH orexin. Therefore, we determined whether orexin and ppDyn mRNA levels in LH or medial hypothalamus (including perifornical and dorsomedial areas) of F344 or Sprague-Dawley (SD) outbred rats, are altered following: 1) cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) conditioned place preference (CPP); 2) chronic (14 days) cocaine exposure using both ""binge"" pattern administration in steady-dose (45 mg/kg/day) and escalating-dose (45-90 mg/kg/day) regimens; and 3) acute (1 day) and chronic (14 days) withdrawal from cocaine with opioid receptor antagonist naloxone treatment (1 mg/kg). We found that orexin mRNA levels were decreased after cocaine place conditioning in the LH of SD rats. A decreased LH orexin mRNA level was also observed after chronic escalating-dose cocaine (but not CPP pattern regimen without conditioning, or steady-dose regimen) in both strains. In F344 rats only, acute withdrawal from chronic escalating-dose cocaine administration resulted in increases in both LH orexin and ppDyn mRNA levels, which were unaltered by naloxone or after chronic withdrawal. Our results suggest that (1) alteration of LH orexin gene expression is region-specific after cocaine place conditioning in SD rats and dose-dependent after chronic exposure in both strains; and (2) increased LH orexin and ppDyn gene expressions in F344 rats may contribute to negative affective states in cocaine withdrawal."
"Glucocorticoids (corticosterone in birds and rodents and cortisol in all other mammals) are glucoregulatory hormones that are synthesized in response to a range of stimuli including stress and are regularly measured in the assessment of animal welfare. Glucocorticoids have many normal or non-stress-related functions, and glucocorticoid synthesis can increase in response to pleasure, excitement, and arousal as well as fear, anxiety, and pain. Often, when assessing animal welfare, little consideration is given to normal non-stress-related glucocorticoid functions or the complex mechanisms that regulate the effects of glucocorticoids on physiology. In addition, it is rarely acknowledged that increased glucocorticoid synthesis can indicate positive welfare states or that a stress response can increase fitness and improve the welfare of an animal. In this paper, we review how and when glucocorticoid synthesis increases, the actions mediated through type I and type II glucocorticoid receptors, the importance of corticosteroid-binding globulin, the role of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and the key aspects of neurophysiology relevant to activating the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. This is discussed in the context of animal welfare assessment, particularly under the biological functioning and affective states frameworks. We contend that extending the assessment of animal welfare to key brain regions afferent to the hypothalamus and incorporating the aspects of glucocorticoid physiology that affect change in target tissue will advance animal welfare science and inspire more comprehensive assessment of the welfare of animals."
"Paranoia is characterized by a lack of perceived social safeness and associated negative affect. Low self-esteem, negative self-concepts and negative emotions have been shown to contribute to paranoid symptom formation. Thus, interventions focusing on affiliation and positive affect might be particularly helpful for patients with paranoia. The present study experimentally tested the effect of a one-session, brief compassion-focused imagery derived from Compassion-Focused Therapy (Gilbert, ) versus a control imagery condition in a repeated measures randomized design. A negative affective state was induced via in-sensu exposure to a recent distressful social situation in order to provide a minimum level of threat-related arousal to be down-regulated by the interventions thereafter. The sample consisted of psychotic patients with paranoid ideation (N = 51) who were randomly assigned to one of the experimental conditions. Effects on postulated causal mechanisms, i.e., self-relating (self-reassurance, self-compassion, self-criticism), and affect (self-reported affective states, skin conductance levels) as well as on state paranoia, were tested. Subjective benefit and appraisals of the intervention were explored. There were no specific intervention effects on negative self-relating, negative affect and skin-conductance or on paranoia. However, compassion-focused imagery had significant effects on self-reassurance and happiness. Explorative analyses revealed that the majority of the participants appraised the intervention in a positive manner, indicating good acceptance. The intervention showed an effect on some of the postulated mechanisms but not on others, which might have been because of its brevity. Further investigation of interventions targeting affiliation for people with paranoid experiences appears worthwhile. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: Affiliative imagery work is feasible and appraised positively in psychotic patients. Brief compassion focused imagery increased feelings of happiness and reassurance but did not improve negative self-relating, negative affect or paranoia. Further investigation is warranted to identify which patients benefit most from affiliative imagery."
"To explore the usefulness of emotional and environmental cues in distinguishing different patterns and potential subtypes of hair pulling in trichotillomania, we looked at the responses of 75 chronic hair pullers who had identified relevant cues for hair pulling from a 339 item list. Principal components analysis suggested two independent components which were important to hair pulling, one distinguished by negative affective states (NA), and the other by sedentary activities and contemplative attitudes (S). High NA scores were related to hair pulling which was the focus of the Ss' attention, as well as with increased prevalence of lifetime obsessive compulsive disorder, other anxiety disorders, current and past depression, and obsessive compulsive personality disorder. High SA scores were related to a history of major depression only. Weighted scores on these components may be useful in further elaborating the phenomenology of trichotillomania and designing appropriate treatment interventions."
"OBJECTIVES: High exercise intensity may be associated with reduced adherence to exercise programmes, possibly because it is perceived as aversive. However, several authors have suggested that an intensity as high as 60% or 70% of maximal aerobic capacity (VO(2max)) is necessary for exercise to elicit positive affective changes. To elucidate this discrepancy, the affective responses to increasing levels of exercise intensity were examined. DESIGN: In total, 30 volunteers rated their affect every minute as they ran on a treadmill while the speed and grade were progressively increased. METHOD: The methodology was unique in three respects: (1) affect was assessed in terms of the dimensions of the circumplex model instead of distinct affective states, (2) affect was assessed repeatedly before, during, and after exercise, not only before and after, and (3) exercise intensity was standardized across participants in terms of metabolically comparable phases (beginning, ventilatory threshold, VO(2max)) instead of percentages of maximal capacity. RESULTS: Pre-to-post-exercise comparisons indicated affective benefits in the form of increased energetic arousal and decreased tense arousal. During exercise, however, affective valence deteriorated beyond the ventilatory threshold and until VO(2max), a trend that reversed itself instantaneously during cool-down. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise intensity that requires a transition to anaerobic metabolism can have a transient but substantial negative impact on affect and this may, in turn, reduce adherence to exercise programmes."
"The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether the cognitive organization of labels of emotion differs from descriptions of affective states. This was done in the context of determining whether the attributions of labels of emotion and descriptions of affective responses in jealousy situations differed according to the status of the interloper, presence of an audience to the untoward behavior, and sex of the respondent. The subjects, 300 male and female junior college students, read vignettes which placed them at a party where their mates passionately kissed interlopers of varying status, and whose transgressions were, or were not, observed by others. The subjects were required to indicate the likelihood that they would experience anger, disgust, fear, jealousy, sadness, and surprise, and 49 cognitive and physiological descriptions of the affective states referred to by the aforementioned labels of emotion. Different findings were obtained with the labels and descriptors of affective states. This was interpreted as support for the systems theory of G.E. Schwartz. The descriptions, but not the labels, indicated that men were most upset when the interloper was a best friend and least concerned when he was a stranger. In contrast, women were most upset when the interloper was someone of equal or lower status than themselves and least upset when the interloper was their best friend."
"The affective foundations of depression and addictions are discussed from a cross-species - animal to human - perspective of translational psychiatric research. Depression is hypothesized to arise from an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to terminate protracted activation of separation-distress (PANIC/GRIEF) systems of the brain, a shutdown mechanism which may be in part mediated by down-regulation of dopamine based reward-SEEKING resources. This shutdown of the brain's core motivational machinery is organized by shifts in multiple peptide systems, particularly increased dynorphin (kappa opioids). Addictions are conceived to be primarily mediated by obsessive behaviors sustained by reward-SEEKING circuits in the case of psychostimulant abuse, and also powerful consummatory-PLEASURE responses in the case of opioid abuse, which in turn capture SEEKING circuits. Both forms of addiction, as well as others, eventually deplete reward-SEEKING resources, leading to a state of dysphoria which can only temporarily be reversed by drugs of abuse, thereby promoting a negative affect that sustains addictive cycles. In other words, the opponent affective process - the dysphoria of diminished SEEKING resources - that can be aroused by sustained over-arousal of separation-distress (PANIC/GRIEF) as well as direct pharmacological over-stimulation and depletion of SEEKING resources, may be a common denominator for the genesis of both depression and addiction. Envisioning the foundation of such psychiatric problems as being in imbalances of the basic mammalian emotional systems that engender prototype affective states may provide more robust translational research strategies, coordinated with, rather than simply focusing on, the underlying molecular dynamics. Emotional vocalizations might be one of the best ways to monitor the underlying affective dynamics in commonly used rodent models of psychiatric disorders."
"Studies of emotion have provided occasional support for physiological differentiation of affective states; however, the evidence has been inconsistent. The aims of the present study were to investigate cardiovascular changes associated with relived experiences of happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust and to examine the utility of methods designed to optimize the induction of emotional responses. Thirty-four undergraduates who scored 0.5 sd above the mean on Larsen and Diener's Affect Intensity Measure described their most intense experiences of five emotions. These descriptions were then used to induce those emotions while blood pressure and other hemodynamic measures were monitored. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and stroke volume differentiated among emotions. The results support the suggestion that cardiovascular activity differentiates emotional states and provide some insight into the physiological adjustments subserving such effects. The study demonstrates a method that may be applied to studies of discrete emotions."
"OBJECTIVE: The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has dramatically improved survival rates following sudden cardiac death episodes. However, researchers have devoted little attention to the psychosocial consequences of living with the device. The current study used a longitudinal design to evaluate the impact of adaptation to the ICD on incidence and severity of anxiety and depression. METHOD: ICD recipients were administered standardized anxiety and depression questionnaires as well as questions evaluating quality of life related to the ICD in two consecutive yearly assessments. A preliminary evaluation of potentially important theoretical variables, such as the perceived predictability and controllability of shock onset was also conducted. RESULTS: One-third of the study population (N = 38) had clinically significant levels of anxiety, depressed mood, and fear of symptoms of autonomic arousal. These negative affective states persisted over time, with 40 to 63 percent of subjects continuing to have ongoing difficulties over a one-year time period. Anxiety about the ICD firing was closely associated with the occurrence of depression, while avoidance of activities was associated with anxiety. ""Worry"" about the ICD and a belief that ICD firing can be predicted were associated with anxiety sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive and anxiety states in ICD recipients may be frequent, clinically significant, and resistant to spontaneous resolution. Early signs of anxiety and depression in ICD recipients should be evaluated. Implications for future research are discussed."
"Histamine H1 receptor systems have been shown in animal studies to have important roles in the reversal of sensorimotor gating deficits, as measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI). H1-antagonist treatment attenuates the PPI impairments caused by either blockade of NMDA glutamate receptors or facilitation of dopamine transmission. The current experiment brought the investigation of H1 effects on sensorimotor gating to human studies. The effects of the histamine H1 antagonist meclizine on the startle response and PPI were investigated in healthy male subjects with high baseline startle responses and low PPI levels. Meclizine was administered to participants (n=24) using a within-subjects design with each participant receiving 0, 12.5, and 25 mg of meclizine in a counterbalanced order. Startle response, PPI, heart rate response, galvanic skin response, and changes in self-report ratings of alertness levels and affective states (arousal and valence) were assessed. When compared with the control (placebo) condition, the two doses of meclizine analyzed (12.5 and 25 mg) produced significant increases in PPI without affecting the magnitude of the startle response or other physiological variables. Meclizine also caused a significant increase in overall self-reported arousal levels, which was not correlated with the observed increase in PPI. These results are in agreement with previous reports in the animal literature and suggest that H1 antagonists may have beneficial effects in the treatment of subjects with compromised sensorimotor gating and enhanced motor responses to sensory stimuli."
"The present study was designed to investigate the neuroendocrine modifications during affective states. In particular, we investigate if the pleasantness of the stimuli has a different effect on neuroendocrine responses. To address this issue, we compared the effects of pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant pictures on catecholamine, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and prolactin plasma levels. Ten male participants were submitted to three experimental sessions, each on one of the three experimental days, a week apart in a counterbalanced order. Although in the subjective arousal rating, pleasant (erotic pictures) and unpleasant stimuli (pictures of mutilated bodies) receive the same high score, a different neuroendocrine pattern was obtained: unpleasant stimuli elicited a decrease in prolactin concentration and increases in noradrenaline, cortisol, and ACTH levels, whereas pleasant slide set viewing induced an increase in prolactin levels. The results suggest that the neuroendocrine system responds selectively to affective motivationally relevant pictures."
"The role of hyperventilation in the aetiology of anxiety disorders was investigated in an analogue study. It was hypothesised that induced hyperventilation would alter subsequent subjective and physiological responses to visually presented agoraphobic material. Three groups (N = 16) of students were used and each was divided into two sub-groups which were presented with slides of either potentially agoraphobic or neutral content. During the first phase of the experiment, subjects were exposed to 10 slides whilst their breathing rate was manipulated. Group FB was instructed to hyperventilate by asking the subjects to breathe fast and deeply, Group SB was instructed to breathe at a slow rate and Group NB breathed normally. After a recovery phase, subjects were re-exposed to the same visual stimuli as used in the first phase of the experiment. Measures of skin conductance response amplitude were obtained for each stimulus in the series. In addition, heart rate and respiration were monitored, and subjective measures of somatic and affective states were obtained. Subjects also rated the pleasantness of the stimuli. The hyperventilation instructions resulted in delayed electrodermal habituation relative to the other groups. This finding could not be accounted for in terms of group differences in either physiological or subjective 'arousal'."
"OBJECTIVE: This study compared the relation between negative mood states and memory in young and elderly subjects. METHOD: Forty-five normal, healthy young volunteers (ages 19-35 years) and 45 normal, healthy elderly volunteers (ages 60-78 years) were administered a verbal list-learning task and self-rated scales of affective states. RESULTS: The elderly group, but not the young group, consistently exhibited significant correlations between their performance on verbal recall measures and their ratings of their anxiety, depression, and withdrawal; i.e., within the elderly group, higher levels of negative affective states were associated with poorer memory. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that aging modulates the relation between emotional state and memory functions, and they are consistent with the hypothesis that the elderly are more vulnerable than the young to the adverse effects of negative emotional states on memory. Therefore, even in normal elderly individuals without diagnosable psychopathology, negative affective states (such as anxiety and depression) may interfere with memory functioning."
"Recent neuroimaging and neuropsychological work has begun to shed light on how the brain responds to the viewing of facial expressions of emotion. However, one important category of facial expression that has not been studied on this level is the facial expression of pain. We investigated the neural response to pain expressions by performing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as subjects viewed short video sequences showing faces expressing either moderate pain or, for comparison, no pain. In alternate blocks, the same subjects received both painful and non-painful thermal stimulation. Facial expressions of pain were found to engage cortical areas also engaged by the first-hand experience of pain, including anterior cingulate cortex and insula. The reported findings corroborate other work in which the neural response to witnessed pain has been examined from other perspectives. In addition, they lend support to the idea that common neural substrates are involved in representing one's own and others' affective states."
"A number of studies have shown that mental challenge under controlled experimental conditions is associated with elevations in inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). However, relatively little work has been done on the effects of 'naturalistic' stressors on acute changes in inflammatory markers. The present study examined whether perceived arousal, valence and dominance in musicians are associated with pro-inflammatory and oxidative responses to a concert situation. Blood and salivary samples obtained from 48 members of a symphony orchestra on the day of rehearsal (i.e., control situation) and on the following day of premiere concert (i.e., test situation) were used to determine changes in salivary cortisol, pro-inflammatory markers (plasma myeloperoxidase, serum CRP, plasma IL-6), oxidative stress markers (paraoxonase1 activity and malondialdehyde), and homocysteine, a risk factor for vascular disease. Results of regression analyses showed a significant trend to increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) response in individuals with low valence score. Both affective states, valence and arousal, were identified as significant predictors of cortisol response during concert. In addition, control levels of plasma malondialdehyde were positively correlated with differences in IL-6 levels between premiere and rehearsal (r=.38, p=.012), pointing to higher oxidative stress in individuals with pronounced IL-6 response. Our results indicate that stress of public performance leads to increased concentrations of plasma MPO (20%), IL-6 (27%) and salivary cortisol (44%) in musicians. The decreasing effect of pleasantness on the MPO response was highly pronounced in non-smokers (r=-.60, p<.001), suggesting a significant role of emotional valence in stress-induced secretion of MPO. Additional studies are needed to assess the generalizability of these findings to other 'naturalistic' stress situations."
"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the influence of state and trait affect on HIV risk behaviors. DESIGN: Men who have sex with men (N = 155) completed reports of trait affect and daily reports of affect and sexual behaviors each night for up to 30 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Analyses focused on the role of state and trait positive activation (PA), negative activation (NA), anxious arousal (AA), and sexual activation (SA) on sexual risk taking, operationalized as having a sex partner, a partner-related risk composite, and an HIV risk behavior composite. RESULTS: State SA was positively associated with having a sex partner and HIV risk behaviors; trait SA was positively associated with partner-related risk. State AA was negatively associated with having a sex partner and positively associated with HIV risk behaviors. Trait AA had a negative association with partner-related risk and moderated the effects of state AA. State PA was negatively associated with HIV risk behaviors, and trait PA had a main effect on having a sex partner. NA had no significant trait or state effects. CONCLUSION: These data suggest a role for multiple affective states in sexual risk taking. Models of HIV risk-taking behaviors should be extended to include affective processes."
"This article explores the hypothesis that self-injurious behavior (SIB) of the type associated with borderline personality disorder (BPD) has an important mood regulatory function. Thirty-eight female inpatients with an Axis II diagnosis of BPD and a history of SIB rated a variety of mood and affective states, using visual analog scales recalled over the course of usual SIB experiences. Subjects were additionally divided into two groups according to whether they typically experience pain during SIB (BPD-P group) or did not (BPD-NP group). For both groups, the visual analog scale ratings revealed significant mood elevation and decreased dissociation following self injury, with a peak in dissociative symptoms during self injury. The ratings of dissociative symptoms were found to be higher in the BPD-NP group when compared to the BPD-P group across all stages of SIB. The ratings of sexual arousal did not change over the course of SIB for either group. These findings are discussed in light of current knowledge of the relationship between SIB and mood."
"Affect valuation theory (AVT) predicts cultural variation in the affective states that people ideally want to feel (i.e., ""ideal affect""). National and ethnic comparisons support this prediction: For instance, European Americans (EA) value high arousal positive (HAP) states (e.g., excitement) more and low arousal positive (LAP) states (e.g., calm) less than Hong Kong Chinese. In this article, the authors examine whether religions differ in the ideal affective states they endorse. The authors predicted that Christianity values HAP more and LAP less than Buddhism. In Study 1, they compared Christian and Buddhist practitioners' ideal affect. In Studies 2 and 3, they compared the endorsement of HAP and LAP in Christian and Buddhist classical texts (e.g., Gospels, Lotus Sutra) and contemporary self-help books (e.g., Your Best Life Now, Art of Happiness). Findings supported predictions, suggesting that AVT applies to religious and to national and ethnic cultures."
"There is converging evidence that physical activity influences affective states. It has been found that aerobic exercise programs can significantly diminish negative affect. Moreover, among healthy individuals, moderate levels of physical activity seem to increase energetic arousal and positive affect. However, the predictive utility of affective states for bodily movement has rarely been investigated. In this study, we examined whether momentarily assessed affect is associated with bodily movement in everyday life. Using a previously published data set (Schwerdtfeger, Eberhardt, & Chmitorz, 2008), we reanalyzed 12-hr ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data from 124 healthy volunteers. Electronic momentary positive-activated affect (EMA-PAA) and negative affect (EMA-NA) were assessed via handheld computers, and bodily movement was recorded via accelerosensors. Generalized linear mixed models were calculated. Results indicated that EMAPAA increases were accompanied by bodily movement increases of varying intensity. EMA-NA was also positively associated with increases in certain kinds of bodily movement. In light of previous research, this finding suggests that affect and bodily movement may have circular effects on each other."
"Potentiation of startle has been demonstrated in experimentally produced aversive emotional states, and clinical reports suggest that potentiated startle may be associated with fear or anxiety. To test the generalizability of startle potentiation across a variety of emotional states as well as its sensitivity to individual differences in fearfulness, the acoustic startle response of 17 high- and 15 low-fear adult subjects was assessed during fear, anger, joy, sadness, pleasant relaxation, and neutral imagery. Startle responses were larger in all aversive affective states than during pleasant imagery. This effect was enhanced among high fear subjects, although followup testing indicated that other affective individual differences (depression and anger) may also be related to increased potentiation of startle in negative affect. Startle latency was reduced during high- rather than low-arousal imagery but was unaffected by emotional valence."
"When facing and evaluating the present state of the world, the brain generates predictions and expectancies together with some specific emotional state which imposes on any given situation - or rather on the individual relationship to that situation - its essential meaning that basically orients the choice of an appropriate behavioural strategy. This general notion is exemplified by concrete data concerning brain mechanisms which underlie aggressive behaviour."
"Caffeine's metabolic and performance effects have been widely reported. However, caffeine's effects on affective states during prolonged exercise are unknown. Therefore, this was examined in the present study. Following an overnight fast and in a randomised, double-blind, counterbalanced design, twelve endurance trained male cyclists performed 90 min of exercise at 70% VO((2) max) 1h after ingesting 6 mg kg(-)(1) BM of caffeine (CAF) or placebo (PLA). Dimensions of affect and perceived exertion were assessed at regular intervals. During exercise, pleasure ratings were better maintained (F((3),(3)(8))=4.99, P < 0.05) in the CAF trial compared to the PLA trial with significantly higher ratings at 15, 30 and 75 min (all P < 0.05). Perceived exertion increased (F((3),(3)(8)) = 19.86, P < 0.01) throughout exercise and values, overall, were significantly lower (F((1),(1)(1)) = 9.26, P < 0.05) in the CAF trial compared to the PLA trial. Perceived arousal was elevated during exercise but did not differ between trials. Overall, the results suggest that a moderate dose of CAF ingested 1h prior to exercise maintains a more positive subjective experience during prolonged cycling. This observation may partially explain caffeine's ergogenic effects."
"Work on facial expressions of emotions (Calder, Burton, Miller, Young, & Akamatsu, [2001]) and emotionally inflected speech (Banse & Scherer, [1996]) has successfully delineated some of the physical properties that underlie emotion recognition. To identify the acoustic cues used in the perception of nonverbal emotional expressions like laugher and screams, an investigation was conducted into vocal expressions of emotion, using nonverbal vocal analogues of the ""basic"" emotions (anger, fear, disgust, sadness, and surprise; Ekman & Friesen, [1971]; Scott et al., [1997]), and of positive affective states (Ekman, [1992], [2003]; Sauter & Scott, [2007]). First, the emotional stimuli were categorized and rated to establish that listeners could identify and rate the sounds reliably and to provide confusion matrices. A principal components analysis of the rating data yielded two underlying dimensions, correlating with the perceived valence and arousal of the sounds. Second, acoustic properties of the amplitude, pitch, and spectral profile of the stimuli were measured. A discriminant analysis procedure established that these acoustic measures provided sufficient discrimination between expressions of emotional categories to permit accurate statistical classification. Multiple linear regressions with participants' subjective ratings of the acoustic stimuli showed that all classes of emotional ratings could be predicted by some combination of acoustic measures and that most emotion ratings were predicted by different constellations of acoustic features. The results demonstrate that, similarly to affective signals in facial expressions and emotionally inflected speech, the perceived emotional character of affective vocalizations can be predicted on the basis of their physical features."
"Specificity of vaginal pulse amplitude and vaginal blood volume in reaction to visual sexual stimuli was investigated by comparing responses to sexual, anxiety-inducing, sexually threatening, and neutral film excerpts. Subjective sexual arousal, body sensations, emotional experience, skin conductance, and heart rate were monitored along with the genital measures. Self-report data confirmed the generation of affective states as intended. Results demonstrated response specificity of vaginal vasocongestion to sexual stimuli. In terms of both convergent and divergent validity, vaginal pulse amplitude was the superior genital measure. Skin conductance discriminated among stimuli only to a small degree, whereas heart rate failed to discriminate among stimuli altogether."
"Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are emitted by rodents and can signal either negative or positive affective states in social and nonsocial contexts. Our recent work has utilized selective breeding based upon the emission of 50 kHz USVs in response to standard cross species hand play-namely experimenters 'tickling' rats. Previous work has shown that high-tickle responsive animals (i.e., rats emitting abundant 50 kHz USVs) are gregarious and express enhanced positive emotional behaviors relative to animals exhibiting low 50 kHz USVs. The present study extends this work by examining the developmental profile of play behavior and the suppression of play behavior by predator (cat) odor in juvenile high-line and low-line animals. Results support dissociations in key play measures between these groups, with high-line animals emitting more dorsal contacts during play and low-line animals emitting more pinning behavior. For cat-odor induced play suppression, we found that high-line animals exhibit elevated suppression of play for a prolonged period compared to low-line rats. In contrast, low-line animals returned to normal levels of play just 1 day post-predator odor experience. These findings support the idea that emotional arousal may differ between these selectively bred groups, and extends previous work by demonstrating a possible influence of altered emotional learning and conditioning in these phenotypically different animals. One possibility is that high-line animals exhibit enhanced associative learning abilities leading to stronger negative contextual conditioning. These findings suggest that selection for positive or negative social-emotional phenotypes may also segregate genes that control emotional learning abilities in unanticipated ways."
"At present there is no direct brain measure of basic emotional dynamics from the human brain. EEG provides non-invasive approaches for monitoring brain electrical activity to emotional stimuli. Event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) analysis, based on power shifts in specific frequency bands, has some potential as a method for differentiating responses to basic emotions as measured during brief presentations of affective stimuli. Although there appears to be fairly consistent theta ERS in frontal regions of the brain during the earliest phases of processing affective auditory stimuli, the patterns do not readily distinguish between specific emotions. To date it has not been possible to consistently differentiate brain responses to emotion-specific affective states or stimuli, and some evidence to suggests the theta ERS more likely measures general arousal processes rather than yielding veridical indices of specific emotional states. Perhaps cortical EEG patterns will never be able to be used to distinguish discrete emotional states from the surface of the brain. The implications and limitations of such approaches for understanding human emotions are discussed."
"Physiological measures have traditionally been viewed in social psychology as useful only in assessing general arousal and therefore as incapable of distinguishing between positive and negative affective states. This view is challenged in the present report. Sixteen subjects in a pilot study were exposed briefly to slides and tones that were mildly to moderately evocative of positive and negative affect. Facial electromyographic (EMG) activity differentiated both the valence and intensity of the affective reaction. Moreover, independent judges were unable to determine from viewing videotapes of the subjects' facial displays whether a positive or negative stimulus had been presented or whether a mildly or moderately intense stimulus had been presented. In the full experiment, 28 subjects briefly viewed slides of scenes that were mildly to moderately evocative of positive and negative affect. Again, EMG activity over the brow (corrugator supercilia), eye (orbicularis oculi), and cheek (zygomatic major) muscle regions differentiated the pleasantness and intensity of individuals' affective reactions to the visual stimuli even though visual inspection of the videotapes again indicated that expressions of emotion were not apparent. These results suggest that gradients of EMG activity over the muscles of facial expression can provide objective and continuous probes of affective processes that are too subtle or fleeting to evoke expressions observable under normal conditions of social interaction."
"Coercive sexual behavior exists at alarming rates on college campuses. Researchers attempting to identify factors related to sexual coercion have primarily investigated either the coercing college male or the coerced college female, independent of relationship factors. The present study investigated the prevalence of verbal sexual coercion, the beliefs and attitudes of sexually coercive and noncoercive men, and the differences in affective states between groups and at different stages of relationship development. Undergraduate students were grouped on the basis of their self-reported sexual experience history as being sexually inexperienced, having had consensual sexual relationships only, or having had coercive sexual relationships. Also, subjects who reported having been sexually experienced were asked to rate the nature of their relationship to their sexual partner. Subjects completed measures referring to sexual attitudes, sexual arousal patterns, and the emotional components of a sexual encounter. Analyses indicated that 42% of the males in the sample had engaged in verbal sexual coercion. Differences on the measures were found between the sexual experience groups and the relationship type subgroups. Results are discussed in the context of the situational model, in which the coercive male plays an active role in shaping his environment."
"This paper reviews briefly a series of electrophysiological, neurochemical, and behavioural studies concerning the role by periventricular structures (periaqueductal gray and medial hypothalamus) in the generation of aversive affective states and in the organization of overt escape behaviours."
"To provide a means for recognition of affect from a distance, this paper analyzes the capability of gait to reveal a person's affective state. We address interindividual versus person-dependent recognition, recognition based on discrete affective states versus recognition based on affective dimensions, and efficient feature extraction with respect to affect. Principal component analysis (PCA), kernel PCA, linear discriminant analysis, and general discriminant analysis are compared to either reduce temporal information in gait or extract relevant features for classification. Although expression of affect in gait is covered by the primary task of locomotion, person-dependent recognition of motion capture data reaches 95% accuracy based on the observation of a single stride. In particular, different levels of arousal and dominance are suitable for being recognized in gait. It is concluded that gait can be used as an additional modality for the recognition of affect. Application scenarios include monitoring in high-security areas, human-robot interaction, and cognitive home environments."
"To study affect regulation in adults with unipolar (n=38) and bipolar (n=38) forms of childhood-onset depression (COD), as compared with adults with no history of psychiatric illness (n=60), we examined affective modulation of the startle eyeblink reflex. Participants were subjected to binaural bursts of white noise while viewing pictures designed to elicit pleasant, neutral, or unpleasant affective states. The blink response was recorded from surface electrodes over the orbicularis oculi muscle during and following pictures. Participants rated the valence and arousal of their responses. Unlike control or bipolar groups, the unipolar group displayed a greater startle during the neutral condition than during the pleasant condition, and failed to display an increase in startle during the unpleasant condition. The bipolar group, unlike the unipolar and control groups, displayed a similar startle response after pleasant and unpleasant pictures. Participants with a high number of lifetime depressive episodes displayed a blunted startle response across affective conditions. Groups reported similar subjective responses to affective stimuli. Current affective symptoms and comorbid diagnoses did not influence startle modulation. In unipolar and bipolar forms of COD, unusual affective modulation or maintenance of the startle response, respectively, may reflect underlying deficits in affect regulation."
"The neural correlates of many emotional states have been studied, most recently through the technique of fMRI. However, nothing is known about the neural substrates involved in evoking one of the most overwhelming of all affective states, that of romantic love, about which we report here. The activity in the brains of 17 subjects who were deeply in love was scanned using fMRI, while they viewed pictures of their partners, and compared with the activity produced by viewing pictures of three friends of similar age, sex and duration of friendship as their partners. The activity was restricted to foci in the medial insula and the anterior cingulate cortex and, subcortically, in the caudate nucleus and the putamen, all bilaterally. Deactivations were observed in the posterior cingulate gyrus and in the amygdala and were right-lateralized in the prefrontal, parietal and middle temporal cortices. The combination of these sites differs from those in previous studies of emotion, suggesting that a unique network of areas is responsible for evoking this affective state. This leads us to postulate that the principle of functional specialization in the cortex applies to affective states as well."
"Repeated retrieval of a subset of previously observed events can cause forgetting of the non-retrieved events. We examined how affective states experienced during retrieval modulate such retrieval-induced forgetting by inducing positive, negative, and neutral moods in subjects immediately before they attempted to retrieve studied items. On the basis of recent work, we hypothesized that positive moods encourage relational processing, which should increase interference from related events and thus enhance retrieval-induced forgetting. By contrast, negative moods should encourage item-specific processing, which should reduce interference and thus reduce such forgetting. Our results are consistent with these predictions. When subjects were in negative moods, repeated retrieval did not cause forgetting of the non-retrieved material, whereas when subjects were in positive and neutral moods, they showed reliable retrieval-induced forgetting. Our findings suggest that the emotions involved during interrogation of a witness can affect the result of repeated interrogations."
"The profound self-destructiveness and tenacity of eating disorders found among women abused and neglected in childhood become comprehensible when understood within a complex posttraumatic conceptualization as desperate attempts to regulate overwhelming affective states and construct a coherent sense of self and system of meaning. Trauma leads to the predictable consequences of dysregulation of the arousal system, avoidance, and constriction of affect; coherence of self and world are shattered. Abused patients' childhood experiences teach them that to need is to expose oneself to the pain of abandonment and betrayal at the hands of individuals responsible for their care. Consequently, needs-psychological, physical, and spiritual-come to be perceived as dangerous, and human relationships are simultaneously yearned for and feared. Robbed of the opportunity to develop a cohesive self and a coherent system of meaning and faith to sustain from within, the traumatized eating-disorder patient turns to the culture to tell her who to be and how to live; she learns that to conquer rather than satisfy needs and to be ""in control"" (an internal state of equanimity manifested externally in a thin body) will bring meaning and purpose. Binge eating, purging, and starving become apt metaphors for the boundless hunger, the wish to fulfill needs together with the wish to rid oneself forever of need, the desire to ""purify"" the damaged psychic and physical self, and the hope of restoring meaning. The treatment of the traumatized eating disorder patient is complex. Individual therapy provides the opportunity for intensive relational work that begins to restore faith in human connection and that provides a ""safe base"" from which to examine the trauma and separate past from present. Therapy groups for eating-disordered women and trauma survivors provide relief from isolation, valuable perspectives from others who have ""been there,"" and the opportunity to contribute to others' healing as one heals. Ultimately, these patients must be willing to leave the world of obsession with food and weight, which guarantees safety from interpersonal hurt while it simultaneously guarantees that hope will not be restored. Though reconnecting with humanity carries the risk of further pain, it opens up the opportunity for connection, healing, and growth."
"In an attempt to investigate the impact of positive emotions on visual attention within the context of Fredrickson's (1998) broaden-and-build model, eye tracking was used in two studies to measure visual attentional preferences of college students (n=58, n=26) to emotional pictures. Half of each sample experienced induced positive mood immediately before viewing slides of three similarly-valenced images, in varying central-peripheral arrays. Attentional breadth was determined by measuring the percentage viewing time to peripheral images as well as by the number of visual saccades participants made per slide. Consistent with Fredrickson's theory, the first study showed that individuals induced into positive mood fixated more on peripheral stimuli than did control participants; however, this only held true for highly-valenced positive stimuli. Participants under induced positive mood also made more frequent saccades for slides of neutral and positive valence. A second study showed that these effects were not simply due to differences in emotional arousal between stimuli. Selective attentional broadening to positive stimuli may act both to facilitate later building of resources as well as to maintain current positive affective states."
"Motor impairments of psychiatric patients can be assessed with digital recordings of handwriting tasks. The investigation of patients with bipolar affective disorders differentiates intraindividual changes related to the patient's fluctuating affective states. An unmedicated 67-year-old male with 48-hour bipolar ultrarapid cycling was investigated during 8 consecutive days of ultrarapid cycling and 4 weeks later, after remission under treatment with valproate. The handwriting skills of the patient followed the same rhythmic changes of the psychopathology in the first part of the study and a steady pattern in the second phase, after remission. Therefore, it can be assumed that the handwriting skills reflect a state marker of the disease. Poorer handwriting skills on the manic days, as compared to the depressive ones, support the hypothesis of a low arousal in manic patients."
"The purposes of the current study were to examine the affective states associated with hair-pulling in a nonclinical sample and to compare levels of general psychopathology in nonclinical hair-pullers and clinic patients with trichotillomania (TM) or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Subjects included 66 college undergraduates who engaged in hair-pulling unrelated to grooming, 18 patients with TM and 29 patients with OCD. Dimensional (but not categorical) ratings of affective experiences in the nonclinical sample indicated that hair-pulling was associated with decreases in tension, boredom, anger and sadness. Further, the relationship between emotional experiences before and after hair-pulling was more salient than the pre-during relationship conceptualized as central in current diagnostic criteria for TM. Comparisons of psychopathology in nonclinical and clinical samples failed to support a continuum notion of increasing symptomatology in nonclinical pullers, TM patients and individuals with OCD. Some evidence of increased pathology in nonclinical pullers relative to TM patients was obtained, as was further support for a distinction between TM and OCD. Implications of this investigation for conceptualization of TM are discussed."
"Patients present unique combinations of familial relationships, developmental idiosyncrasies, social aberrations, affective states, cognitive abilities, symptoms, defects, and maladaptations. Psychopharmacological treatments form a useful approach to cutting through this complexity to the core pathophysiology. Focusing on disorders that can be brought to complete remission by medication suggests that retarded and agitated depressions, manic and angry hyperactive paranoid states, panic disorder, emotionally unstable character disorders and schizophrenias are governed by the degree of derangement of an affective-activation control system. Defects in this control system are best conceptualized in cybernetic terms rather than in terms of the current rheostat models. Conceptualization of cybernetic defects allows for understanding of psychopathological developments as well as give a framework for pharmacological benefits. One aspect of the activation-affective disorders, are disorders of two types of pleasure regulatory mechanism, here referred to as appetitive and consummatory. The relationship of disorders of these hedonic control mechanisms to affective states and those of drug abuse are considered. This schema also affirms a close relationship between the bipolar affective disorders and the schizophrenias."
"Rats (Rattus norvegicus) emit a variety of ultrasonic vocalizations throughout their lifespan that reflect different forms of emotional arousal and accompanying affective states. In this study, high frequency recordings of ultrasonic vocalizations were made during mating, aggression, and both conspecific and heterospecific (dubbed ""tickling"") rough-and-tumble play behavior. We found that frequency modulated 50-kHz calls (trills and step calls) were positively correlated with positively valenced appetitive behavior during mating, play, and aggression. These calls were also positively correlated with the reward value of these social encounters. However, constant frequency (i.e., flat) 50-kHz calls were not related to appetitive behaviors or reward. In contrast, 22-kHz calls were positively related to aversive/withdrawal behaviors during mating, play, and aggression. Finally, we found that rats self-administered playback of frequency modulated 50-kHz trill calls and avoided playback of 22-kHz calls. Playback of flat 50-kHz calls or tape hiss was neutral. These results suggest that frequency modulated 50-kHz calls index a positively valenced, appetitive, social-emotional state in rats."
"Several clinical theories propose that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by a biologically based affective vulnerability to intense affective experiences and impaired modulation of affective states, which might manifest in high emotional intensity, hyperreactivity, and impaired recovery to baseline. However, few studies have tested these theories based on emotional and biological responses of BPD participants in response to psychosocial stressors. This study examined cortisol, alpha-amylase, and subjective emotional reactivity to social evaluative stress among women with BPD compared with two healthy female control groups: a trait-matched (TM) group scoring similarly to the BPD group on trait measures of negative affect and impulsivity, and a non-trait-matched (NTM) group. Results generally suggested high emotional intensity and high baseline psychobiological arousal among individuals with BPD, but not emotional hyperreactivity or impaired recovery specific to the stressor. Relative to both control groups, BPD participants had higher baseline and overall subjective negative affect, higher baseline cortisol levels, and attenuated stress-related cortisol reactivity. In addition, both the BPD and TM groups had attenuated alpha-amylase reactivity in comparison to the NTM group. The differences between BPD and TM groups on most of the dependent measures suggest that emotional dysregulation in BPD is not merely an extreme variant of normative personality traits. These results suggest that women with BPD demonstrate intense and chronic negative affectivity along with high resting psychobiological arousal and attenuated psychobiological reactivity specific to laboratory stressors."
"""Just-in-time"" interventions (JITs) delivered via smartphones have considerable potential for reducing HIV risk behavior by providing pivotal support at key times prior to sex. However, these programs depend on a thorough understanding of when risk behavior is likely to occur to inform the timing of JITs. It is also critical to understand the most important momentary risk factors that may precede HIV risk behavior, so that interventions can be designed to address them. Applying machine learning (ML) methods to ecological momentary assessment data on HIV risk behaviors can help answer both questions. Eighty HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM) who were not on PrEP completed a daily diary survey each morning and an experience sampling survey up to six times per day via a smartphone application for 30 days. Random forest models achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) values for classifying high-risk condomless anal sex (CAS). These models achieved 80% specificity at a sensitivity value of 74%. Unsurprisingly, the most important contextual risk factors that aided in classification were participants' plans and intentions for sex, sexual arousal, and positive affective states. Findings suggest that survey data collected throughout the day can be used to correctly classify about three of every four high-risk CAS events, while incorrectly classifying one of every five non-CAS days as involving high-risk CAS. A unique set of risk factors also often emerge prior to high-risk CAS events that may be useful targets for JITs."
"BACKGROUND: This study examined the self-efficacy and affective responses to an acute exercise bout in sedentary older and younger women to determine whether aging has an effect on affective states. METHODS: Twenty-five sedentary younger (mean age = 19.9 yrs) and 25 older (mean age = 55.7 yrs) women completed an acute bout of exercise. Affective responses were measured before, during, and immediately following exercise. Self-efficacy responses were measured before and immediately following exercise. RESULTS: Positive engagement, revitalization, tranquility, Felt Arousal and Feeling Scale responses, and self-efficacy were all higher immediately following compared with before or during exercise for both groups of women. In addition, older women experienced higher overall positive engagement and lower physical exhaustion compared with younger women as well as higher tranquility and Feeling Scale responses immediately following exercise. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation found that an acute bout of moderate-intensity exercise produced more positive and fewer negative affective states in both younger and older women."
"Sleep is influenced by diverse factors such as circadian time, affective states, ambient temperature, pain, etc., but pathways mediating these influences are unknown. To identify pathways that may influence sleep, we examined afferents to the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), an area critically implicated in promoting sleep. Injections of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) into the VLPO produced modest numbers of CTB-labeled monoaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus, raphe nuclei, and ventrolateral medulla, as well as a few neurons in the locus coeruleus. Immunohistochemistry for monoaminergic markers showed dense innervation of the VLPO by histaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic fibers. Along with previous findings, these results suggest that the VLPO and monoaminergic nuclei may be reciprocally connected. Retrograde and anterograde tracing showed moderate or heavy inputs to the VLPO from hypothalamic regions including the median preoptic nucleus, lateral hypothalamic area, and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH), autonomic regions including the infralimbic cortex and parabrachial nucleus, and limbic regions including the lateral septal nucleus and ventral subiculum. Light to moderate inputs arose from orexin and melanin concentrating hormone neurons, but cholinergic or dopaminergic inputs were extremely sparse. Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) projections to the VLPO were sparse, but the heavy input to the VLPO from the DMH, which receives direct and indirect SCN inputs, could provide an alternate pathway regulating the circadian timing of sleep. These robust pathways suggest candidate mechanisms by which sleep may be influenced by brain systems regulating arousal, autonomic, limbic, and circadian functions."
"It is well-known that social influences affect consumption decisions. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to elucidate the neural mechanisms associated with social influence with regard to a common consumer good: music. Our study population was adolescents, age 12-17. Music is a common purchase in this age group, and it is widely believed that adolescent behavior is influenced by perceptions of popularity in their reference group. Using 15-s clips of songs from MySpace.com, we obtained behavioral measures of preferences and neurobiological responses to the songs. The data were gathered with, and without, the overall popularity of the song revealed. Song popularity had a significant effect on the participants' likability ratings of the songs. fMRI results showed a strong correlation between the participants' rating and activity in the caudate nucleus, a region previously implicated in reward-driven actions. The tendency to change one's evaluation of a song was positively correlated with activation in the anterior insula and anterior cingulate, two regions that are associated with physiological arousal and negative affective states. Sensitivity to popularity was linked to lower activation levels in the middle temporal gyrus, suggesting a lower depth of musical semantic processing. Our results suggest that a principal mechanism whereby popularity ratings affect consumer choice is through the anxiety generated by the mismatch between one's own preferences and others'. This mismatch anxiety motivates people to switch their choices in the direction of the consensus. Our data suggest that this is a major force behind the conformity observed in music tastes in some teenagers."
"The topic relative to the differential psychobiological mechanisms between cancer and coronary illness has been showing for the last years. In this sense, some theoretical models which have been formulated by relevant authors have suggested the possibility of differentiating cancer and cardiovascular disease, both the onset and the progression, from coping strategies, personality variables and affective states, as well as the different categories of psychosocial stress. Likewise, the implication of psychological distress, such as anxiety, anger and depression for the occurrence of somatic disease has been reported frequently. This research was designed to analyze the psychosocial patterns which could explain the incidence of heart disease, cancer and anxiety based disorders. Measures of life events and stress reactivity were obtained from a total of 109 patients diagnosed as having breast cancer (37), infarct (37), and anxiety (35), and from 72 normal control subjects. Our data tend to show that the cancer group was strongly predicted by lost and illness events, while the coronary group was more associated with work events. The anxiety disorders group lacked a life events dimension, but shared the same category of the infarct group. We also found a strong relationship between depressive reactions and cancer in contrast to the anxiety-anger variable that was more relevant in the infarct patients. The interaction between internal and external stress factors in the etiology of disease is also discussed."
"The color and odor of cosmetics have been shown to be crucial for affective states and able to influence autonomic responses. We report an original procedure to measure the effect on subjects of the color and odor of cosmetic products, and to quantify the correlation between objective (psychophysiological recording) and subjective (psychophysics) responses. Several cosmetic products (lipsticks and nail varnishes) of different colors (white, brown, red, orange, and pink) and odors (two per product) were presented. In a first step, autonomous parameters (skin conductance (SC) and heart rate (HR)) were recorded, and in the second step, subjects rated their sensations on subjective scales (overall appreciation, pleasantness, and emotional arousal). Results indicated that certain color and odor additives in cosmetics act on relaxation, excitation, perceived pleasantness, and emotional arousal. It was also found that certain colors, perceived as pleasant, decreased HR, and that the perception of an 'arousing' perfume significantly increased SC."
"The circumplex model of affect proposes that all affective states arise from cognitive interpretations of core neural sensations that are the product of two independent neurophysiological systems. This model stands in contrast to theories of basic emotions, which posit that a discrete and independent neural system subserves every emotion. We propose that basic emotion theories no longer explain adequately the vast number of empirical observations from studies in affective neuroscience, and we suggest that a conceptual shift is needed in the empirical approaches taken to the study of emotion and affective psychopathologies. The circumplex model of affect is more consistent with many recent findings from behavioral, cognitive neuroscience, neuroimaging, and developmental studies of affect. Moreover, the model offers new theoretical and empirical approaches to studying the development of affective disorders as well as the genetic and cognitive underpinnings of affective processing within the central nervous system."
"The influence of emotion on higher-order cognitive functions, such as attention allocation, planning, and decision-making, is a growing area of research with important clinical applications. In this review, we provide a computational framework to conceptualize emotional influences on inhibitory control, an important building block of executive functioning. We first summarize current neuro-cognitive models of inhibitory control and show how Bayesian ideal observer models can help reframe inhibitory control as a dynamic decision-making process. Finally, we propose a Bayesian framework to study emotional influences on inhibitory control, providing several hypotheses that may be useful to conceptualize inhibitory control biases in mental illness such as depression and anxiety. To do so, we consider the neurocognitive literature pertaining to how affective states can bias inhibitory control, with particular attention to how valence and arousal may independently impact inhibitory control by biasing probabilistic representations of information (i.e., beliefs) and valuation processes (e.g., speed-error tradeoffs)."
"In order to investigate the effects of physical discomfort (i.e., pain) on the induction of mood, 139 participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: sad, sad with physical discomfort, happy, and happy with physical discomfort. Consistent with our hypotheses, the addition of physical discomfort resulted in a significantly stronger induction of self-reported depression, with these findings showing temporal specificity and persisting even after statistically controlling for stable response biases. However, other self-reported affective states, as well as cognitive and behavioral measures, were not significantly affected by physical discomfort. Findings are discussed with regard to making the laboratory induction of sad affect more consistent with the multifaceted experience of depression."
"The present study investigated neuroendocrine and cardiovascular changes during experimentally-induced affective states in abstinent heroin-dependent subjects and healthy controls. The procedure for eliciting emotions in all subjects used pleasant and unpleasant stimuli that did not differ in subjective arousal properties. We investigated whether the valence of the stimuli differentially affected neuroendocrine responses by comparing neutral, pleasant and unpleasant pictures on heart rate (HR), systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), methyl-OH-phenyl-glycol (MHPG), norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EPI), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol (CORT) plasma levels. Twelve abstinent heroin-dependent subjects, in comparison with 12 control subjects, were submitted to three experimental sessions, each on one of three experimental days a week apart, in counterbalanced order: day 1=unpleasant pictures, day 2=pleasant pictures, day 3=neutral pictures. In the rating of subjective arousal pleasant and unpleasant stimuli received the same high score in comparison with neutral stimuli; a different cardiovascular and neuroendocrine pattern was obtained in healthy subjects: unpleasant stimuli elicited increases in HR, SBP, MHPG, NE, ACTH, CORT, whereas neutral and pleasant stimuli did not induce any significant response in hormonal levels. In contrast, in heroin addicts, despite increased perceptions of unpleasantness, HR, SBP, MHPG and NE levels did not increase after disliked stimuli; these subjects also reported increased arousal during exposure to neutral stimuli. In comparison with controls, addicted individuals showed higher CORT and ACTH basal levels, and a consequent lack of response to unpleasant stimuli. The results indicate that neuroendocrine and cardiovascular systems respond selectively to affective, motivationally relevant stimuli, and that substance use disorders may be associated with dysregulation of emotion-processing mechanisms."
"Recent concepts relating to animal welfare accept that animals experience affective states. These are notoriously difficult to measure in non-verbal species, but it is generally agreed that emotional reactions consist of well-coordinated reactions in behaviour, autonomic and brain activation. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether each or a combination of these aspects can differentiate between situations presumed to differ in emotional content. To this end, we repeatedly confronted dwarf goats at short intervals with a covered and an uncovered feed bowl (i.e. presumably frustrating and rewarding situations respectively) whilst simultaneously observing their behaviour, measuring heart-rate and heart-rate variability and haemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortex using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. When faced with a covered feed bowl, goats occupied themselves at locations away from the bowl and showed increased locomotion, while there was a general increase in prefrontal cortical activity. There was little indication of autonomic changes. In contrast, when feed was accessible, the goats reduced locomotion, focused their behaviour on the feed bowl, showed signs of sympathetically mediated arousal reflecting anticipation and, if any cortical activity at all was present, it was concentrated to the left hemisphere. We thus observed patterns in behaviour, sympathetic reaction and brain activity that distinguished between a situation of frustration and one of reward in dwarf goats. These patterns consisted of a well-coordinated set of reactions appropriate in respect of the emotional content of the stimuli used."
"Autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity is viewed as a major component of the emotion response in many recent theories of emotion. Positions on the degree of specificity of ANS activation in emotion, however, greatly diverge, ranging from undifferentiated arousal, over acknowledgment of strong response idiosyncrasies, to highly specific predictions of autonomic response patterns for certain emotions. A review of 134 publications that report experimental investigations of emotional effects on peripheral physiological responding in healthy individuals suggests considerable ANS response specificity in emotion when considering subtypes of distinct emotions. The importance of sound terminology of investigated affective states as well as of choice of physiological measures in assessing ANS reactivity is discussed."
"Caffeine is considered the world's most popular psychoactive substance. Its actions on the central nervous system, mainly mediated by antagonism of adenosine receptors and subsequent modulation of dopaminergic activity, would be particularly sought by depressed patients, as an attempt of self-medication. However, published data suggested that coffee consumption may worsen psychopathological conditions in mood disorders. Thus, we reviewed available evidence in the literature that investigated the effects of coffee consumption on clinical development of underlying psychopathology. Literature research was done by typing on Medline/PubMed and PsychINFO the key words ""coffee AND major depression"", ""coffee AND dysthymia"". The research was limited to English language publications and to studies conducted exclusively on humans. Although literature data are conflicting, extensive follow-up studies indicate a significant caffeine effect on risk reduction of developing clinical depression symptoms. Clinical worsening was observed mainly in cases of postpartum depression and comorbid panic disorder. Taking in account the study limitations, we observed a biphasic profile in caffeine psychostimulant effect: low to moderate doses may correlate with a reduction in depressive risk in healthy subjects and an improvement of many clinical symptoms (attention, arousal, psychomotor performance) in depressed patients, whereas the assumption of high doses may result in thymic dysregulation, favor mixed affective states and worsen circadian profiles and anxiety symptoms."
"Exposure to overwhelming stress often determines how people subsequently organize their perceptions of themselves and of others. Traumatic experiences at different developmental levels have different effects on cognitive, affective and biological self-organization. Acute or chronic exposure to trauma may be expressed as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), dissociative disorders, somatic disturbances and alterations in perception of self and others. These disorders involve (a) the involuntary repetitive re-living of the trauma in thoughts, images, somatic states or behaviors, (b) attempts to avoid dealing with reminders of the past, (c) problems with the modulation of physiological responses to subsequent stress, and (d) a loss of capacity to engage in love and work with pleasure and satisfaction. The display of extremes of emotional distress, or of bizarre or disorganized behaviors, easily obscures the fact that current problems may have their origins in past trauma. The recognition that many psychiatric patients organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of re-living and warding off traumatic memories, reminders and affective states, may help clinicians understand their symptoms as misguided attempts to regain a sense of control and safety, rather than as bizarre behaviors that need to be merely controlled. Since safe attachments appear to be the primary way in which children learn to regulate internal state changes, the negotiation of interpersonal safety needs to be the first focus of treatment. Since the labeling and categorization of emotional states is one of the principal areas of functioning that is disrupted by developmental trauma, treatment needs to include learning how to use words to understand and interpret feelings in general and stressful events, in particular. Since distrust and lack of social safety are critical parts of developmental trauma, structure and predictability are essential. Identifying specific trauma-based perceptions and expectations and learning how to negotiate the fulfillment of one's emotional needs are critical aspects of effective treatment."
"Memory is typically better for emotional relative to neutral images, an effect generally considered to be mediated by arousal. However, this explanation cannot explain the full pattern of findings in the literature. Two experiments are reported that investigate the differential effects of categorical affective states upon emotional memory and the contributions of stimulus dimensions other than pleasantness and arousal to any memory advantage. In Experiment 1, disgusting images were better remembered than equally unpleasant frightening ones, despite the disgusting images being less arousing. In Experiment 2, regression analyses identified affective impact--a factor shown previously to influence the allocation of visual attention and amygdala response to negative emotional images--as the strongest predictor of remembering. These findings raise significant issues that the arousal account of emotional memory cannot readily address. The term impact refers to an undifferentiated emotional response to a stimulus, without requiring detailed consideration of specific dimensions of image content. We argue that ratings of impact relate to how the self is affected. The present data call for further consideration of the theoretical specifications of the mechanisms that lead to enhanced memory for emotional stimuli and their neural substrates."
"OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present study was to test massage applied with an automated massage chair on the back muscles with regard to the effects on the tension of other muscles or on the neurovegetative tone, and to compare three different automated massage techniques. METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers participated in the study. The experiment consisted of an initial 5-minute period of relaxation without massage, and 5-minute periods of three different massage programs (roll-stretch massage, shiatsu massage, and beat massage). Subjects were randomized as to the presentation order. The following physiologic data were collected: frontalis and gastrocnemius electromyogram (EMG) activity, skin conductance, and peripheral skin temperature. Judgments of valence and arousal were registered using the pencil and- paper version of the five-point Self-Assessment Manikin. RESULTS: Roll-stretch and shiatsu massage were rated by participants as more pleasant than the relaxation period without massage or the beat massage. Whereas the four conditions were similar with regard to the mean frontal EMG values (reflecting primarily affective states), they differed regarding the gastrocnemius EMG (relating more to a general level of tension), roll-stretch massage, and shiatsu massage, resulting in less muscle tension than the control condition. Shiatsu massage was associated with significantly lower skin conductance than the control condition, whereas beat massage increased it significantly. A significant increase of skin temperature was found during the roll-stretch massage compared to the no-massage condition. CONCLUSIONS: Automated roll-stretch massage and shiatsu massage applied on the back can rapidly induce measurable relaxation in distant muscles not directly massaged, and is accompanied by signs of neurovegetative calming. Back massage applied by an automated massage chair may be an efficient and inexpensive general relaxation approach, and is especially interesting for patients who dislike to be touched."
"The convergent and discriminant validity of three models of physiological emotion specificity were compared. Forty-two female students served as subjects in a 2 (Context of emotional inductions: real-life, imagery) X 3 (Emotion: fear, anger, control) +1 (Happiness induced in real-life context) repeated measures design. The dependent measures included self-reports of emotion, Gottschalk-Gleser affect scores, back and forearm extensor EMG activity, body movements, heart period, respiration period, skin conductance, skin temperatures, pulse transit time, pulse volume amplitude, and blood volumes. Self-report data confirmed the generation of affective states in both contexts, as intended. Planned multivariate comparisons between physiological profiles established discriminant validity for fear and anger in the real-life context, whereas under imagery, emotion profiles were essentially equal. Convergent validity could not be substantiated. Implications for models of physiological specificity of emotion were discussed."
"There is abundant evidence for abnormalities of the norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5HT) neurotransmitter systems in depression and anxiety disorders. The majority of evidence supports underactivation of serotonergic function and complex dysregulation of noradrenergic function, most consistent with overactivation of this system. Treatment for these disorders requires perturbation of these systems. Reproducible increases in serotonergic function and decreases in noradrenergic function accompany treatment with antidepressants, and these alterations may be necessary for antidepressant efficacy. Dysregulation of these systems clearly mediates many symptoms of depression and anxiety. The underlying causes of these disorders, however, are less likely to be found within the NE and 5HT systems, per se. Rather their dysfunction is likely due to their role in modulating, and being modulated by, other neurobiologic systems that together mediate the symptoms of affective illness. Clarification of noradrenergic and serotonergic modulation of various brain regions may yield a greater understanding of specific symptomatology, as well as the underlying circuitry involved in euthymic and abnormal mood and anxiety states. Disrupted cortical regulation may mediate impaired concentration and memory, together with uncontrollable worry. Hypothalamic abnormalities likely contribute to altered appetite, libido, and autonomic symptoms. Thalamic and brainstem dysregulation contributes to altered sleep and arousal states. Finally, abnormal modulation of cortical-hippocampal-amygdala pathways may contribute to chronically hypersensitive stress and fear responses, possibly mediating features of anxiety, anhedonia, aggression, and affective dyscontrol. The continued appreciation of the neural circuitry mediating affective states and their modulation by neurotransmitter systems should further the understanding of the pathophysiology of affective and anxiety disorders."
"Do 9-15-week-old infants produce differentially organized hand and arm actions in relation to affective states when presented with social and nonsocial stimuli? This question was examined by observing 8 infants longitudinally. They were observed when facing their active and passive mother and an active and passive doll during 4 visits at biweekly intervals. Videotapes were coded in real time using the following measures: Vocalization, Gaze, and Gaze Avert; for face, Smiling, Distressed, and Neutral; for hands, Pointing, Open, Curled, and Closed; and for arms, Extended and At Side. Co-occurrence and lag sequential analyses showed that hand actions were organized with other infant actions to form unique behavioral linkages in each of the 4 conditions. The implications of these findings for the development of nonverbal communication are discussed."
"OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Two experiments examined the impact of viewing unpleasant, pleasant, and neutral photographic slides on cold-pain perception in healthy men and women. In each experiment, participants viewed one of three slide shows (experiment 1 = fear, disgust, or neutral; experiment 2 = erotic, nurturant, or neutral) immediately before a cold-pressor task. Skin conductance and heart rate were recorded during the slide shows, whereas visual analog scale ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness thresholds and pain tolerance were recorded during the cold-pressor task. RESULTS: Viewing fear and disgust slides decreased pain intensity and unpleasantness thresholds, but only the fear slides decreased pain tolerance. In contrast, viewing erotic, but not nurturant, slides increased pain intensity and unpleasantness threshold ratings on the visual analog scale in men, whereas neither nurturant nor erotic slides altered pain tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with a motivational priming model that predicts that unpleasant affective states should enhance pain and that pleasant affective states should attenuate it."
"From the first months of life, human infants produce ""protophones,"" speech-like, non-cry sounds, presumed absent, or only minimally present in other apes. But there have been no direct quantitative comparisons to support this presumption. In addition, by 2 months, human infants show sustained face-to-face interaction using protophones, a pattern thought also absent or very limited in other apes, but again, without quantitative comparison. Such comparison should provide evidence relevant to determining foundations of language, since substantially flexible vocalization, the inclination to explore vocalization, and the ability to interact socially by means of vocalization are foundations for language. Here we quantitatively compare data on vocalization rates in three captive bonobo (Pan paniscus) mother-infant pairs with various sources of data from our laboratories on human infant vocalization. Both humans and bonobos produced distress sounds (cries/screams) and laughter. The bonobo infants also produced sounds that were neither screams nor laughs and that showed acoustic similarities to the human protophones. These protophone-like sounds confirm that bonobo infants share with humans the capacity to produce vocalizations that appear foundational for language. Still, there were dramatic differences between the species in both quantity and function of the protophone and protophone-like sounds. The bonobo protophone-like sounds were far less frequent than the human protophones, and the human protophones were far less likely to be interpreted as complaints and more likely as vocal play. Moreover, we found extensive vocal interaction between human infants and mothers, but no vocal interaction in the bonobo mother-infant pairs-while bonobo mothers were physically responsive to their infants, we observed no case of a bonobo mother vocalization directed to her infant. Our cross-species comparison focuses on low- and moderate-arousal circumstances because we reason the roots of language entail vocalization not triggered by excitement, for example, during fighting or intense play. Language appears to be founded in flexible vocalization, used to regulate comfortable social interaction, to share variable affective states at various levels of arousal, and to explore vocalization itself."
"The current study examined associations between maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and infant emotional reactivity and emotion regulation during the first year of life in a primarily low-income, urban, ethnic/racial minority sample of 52 mother-infant dyads. Mothers completed questionnaires assessing their own trauma exposure history and current PTSD and depressive symptoms and their infants' temperament when the infants were 6 months old. Dyads participated in the repeated Still-Face Paradigm (SFP-R) when the infants were 6 months old, and infant affective states were coded for each SFP-R episode. Mothers completed questionnaires assessing infant trauma exposure history and infant current emotional and behavioral symptoms when the infants were 13 months old. Maternal PTSD symptoms predicted infants' emotion regulation at 6 months as assessed by (a) infant ability to recover from distress during the SFP-R and (b) maternal report of infant rate of recovery from distress/arousal in daily life. Maternal PTSD symptoms also predicted maternal report of infant externalizing, internalizing, and dysregulation symptoms at 13 months. Maternal PTSD was not associated with measures of infant emotional reactivity. Neither maternal depressive symptoms nor infant direct exposure to trauma accounted for the associations between maternal PTSD symptoms and infant outcomes. These findings suggest that maternal PTSD is associated with offspring emotion regulation difficulties as early as infancy. Such difficulties may contribute to increased risk of mental health problems among children of mothers with PTSD."
"An outstanding problem in psychiatry concerns how to link discoveries about the pharmacological, neurophysiological, and neuroanatomical substrates of mental disorders to the abnormal behaviors that they control. A related problem concerns how to understand abnormal behaviors on a continuum with normal behaviors. During the past few decades, neural models have been developed of how normal cognitive and emotional processes learn from the environment, focus attention and act upon motivationally important events, and cope with unexpected events. When arousal or volitional signals in these models are suitably altered, they give rise to symptoms that strikingly resemble negative and positive symptoms of schizophrenia, including flat affect, impoverishment of will, attentional problems, loss of a theory of mind, thought derailment, hallucinations, and delusions. This article models how emotional centers of the brain, such as the amygdala, interact with sensory and prefrontal cortices (notably ventral, or orbital, prefrontal cortex) to generate affective states, attend to motivationally salient sensory events, and elicit motivated behaviors. Closing this feedback loop between cognitive and emotional centers is predicted to generate a cognitive-emotional resonance that can support conscious awareness. When such emotional centers become depressed, negative symptoms of schizophrenia emerge in the model. Such emotional centers are modeled as opponent affective processes, such as fear and relief, whose response amplitude and sensitivity are calibrated by an arousal level and chemical transmitters that slowly inactivate, or habituate, in an activity-dependent way. These opponent processes exhibit an Inverted-U, whereby behavior becomes depressed if the arousal level is chosen too large or too small. The negative symptoms are owing to the way in which the depressed opponent process interacts with other circuits throughout the brain."
"The effects of parental history of hypertension and menstrual phase on systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) and heart rate (HR) responses to two frustrating cognitive tasks were examined in 47 normotensive, young adult women. Subjects with and without a parental history of hypertension were scheduled to be tested during either the follicular (days 7-11 of a 28-day cycle) or luteal (days 17-22) phase of the menstrual cycle. During the laboratory session, HR, SBP, DBP, and self-report of affective states were measured while subjects performed two cognitive tasks (mental arithmetic and concept formation). Results indicated that the magnitude of SBP responses to the two tasks was significantly greater in subjects tested during the follicular phase than in subjects tested in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. No effect of parental hypertension was observed on cardiovascular response measures, though offspring of hypertensive parents reported experiencing significantly less anger during the tasks than subjects with normotensive parents."
