"BACKGROUND: Control of rubella infection is essential for preventing congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) and one of the important steps is to define a target population for vaccination. Therefore this study was done to determine serological evidence of acute rubella infection among under-fives in order to anticipate the magnitude of rubella virus transmission in Tanzania. METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving children aged between 1 and 59 months was conducted between September and October 2014 before national rubella vaccination campaigns commenced. Rubella IgM antibodies were detected using commercial indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Data were analyzed using STATA version 11. RESULTS: A total of230 under-fives were enrolled, their median age was 14 (Interquartile range (IQR) 7-26) months. The overall seroprevalence of rubella IgM antibodies was 10.9 % (25/230) with two confirmed cases of CRS. Two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test showed that the median age of rubella IgM seropositive children was significantly higher than that of IgM seronegative children (39 IQR: 18-51months vs. 14 IQR: 7-24 months, P < 0.001). On multivariate logistic regression analysis increase in age (OR: 1.07, 95 % CI; 1.03-1.1, P < 0.001) and residing in rural areas (OR: 8.07, 95 % CI; 1.43-45.6, P = 0.018) were independently found to predict acute rubella infection among under-fives. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that rubella virus is prevalent in our setting posing a risk of transmitting to childbearing aged women hence increasing the risk of CRS. Increasing prevalence of acute infection with age in under-fives indicates the protective role of maternal antibodies among infants. The sustained vaccination programme of under-fives as effective measure to control CRS should be emphasized in developing countries."
"Anxiety has wide-reaching and complex effects on cognitive performance. Although it can intrude on cognition and interfere with performance, it can also facilitate information processing and behavioural responses. In a previous study, we showed that anxiety induced by threat of shock facilitates performance on the Sustained Attention to Response Task, a vigilance test, which probes response inhibition to infrequent nogo stimuli. The present study sought to identify factors that may have contributed to such improved performance, including on- and off-task thinking (assessed with thought probes) and individual differences in attention control, as measured with the Attention Control Scale. Replicating our prior finding, we showed that shock threat significantly reduced errors of commission on the nogo trials. However, we extended this finding in demonstrating that this effect was driven by subjects with low attention control. We therefore confirm that anxiety increases inhibitory control of prepotent responses--a mechanism which is adaptive under threat--and show that this effect is greater in those who rely more upon such prepotent responding, i.e., those with low attentional control."
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Numerous studies have supported attentional biases toward social threats in socially anxious individuals. The aim of the present study was to investigate the time-course of sustained attention for multiple emotional stimuli using a free-viewing paradigm in social anxiety. METHODS: Thirty-two socially anxious (SA) and 30 non-anxious (NA) participants completed the free-viewing task. Participants were presented with a face array composed of angry, sad, happy and neutral faces for 10 s in each trial. Eye movements were recorded throughout the trial to assess the time-course of attentional processing. RESULTS: Although SA participants did not exhibit initial orienting bias, they had higher fixation probability for angry faces during the 250-1000 ms time intervals, relative to NA participants. SA participants also maintained their attention longer than NA participants did when angry faces were initially fixated upon. Moreover, NA participants showed higher fixation probability for happy faces during the 6-8 s after stimulus onset. We failed to observe attentional avoidance of threat in SA participants. LIMITATIONS: First, this study used a non-clinical sample. Second, the stimuli used in this study were static. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that, relative to non-anxious individuals, socially anxious individuals are characterized by enhanced engagement with social threat at an early stage of processing and difficulty in disengaging from social threat once their initial attention is located on it. Conversely, non-anxious individuals are characterized by enhanced engagement with positive stimuli at a later stage of processing."
"Dengue is still a substantial vector-borne viral disease threat and burden of public health importance worldwide. This situation is complicated by dengue virus unprecedented resurgence and persistence of varied serotypes in endemic-prone areas, and man-made and natural activities consequences that promote vector emergence, transmission dynamics and spread across the Asia-Pacific region. There is an urgent need to strengthen operational and contextual surveillance-response research in improving early detection of active reservoir detection, novel drug in case management and quality evidence-based response including the deployment of dengue mass vaccination. Moreover, sustained mapping and watching of dengue risk factors or determinants, performance and outcome indicators of control or elimination programs effectiveness in defining minimum effective data towards community knowledge-based decision-making policy and effective response packages is imperative. Moreover, implementation of a robust, integrated dengue early warning surveillance, monitoring and response systems metrics is required for evidence-based, timely and cost-effective contextual mitigation strategies, and innovative interventions."
"BACKGROUND: Although several studies have documented an attentional bias toward threat in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the nature of this bias has not been clearly delineated. The present study utilized eye tracking technology to delineate the time course and components of attentional bias for threat cues in combat-related PTSD. METHODS: Veterans with PTSD (n = 21), combat-exposed veterans without PTSD (n = 16), and nonveteran controls (n = 21) viewed emotional expressions (fearful, disgusted, happy) paired with neutral expressions for 3 s presentations. RESULTS: Veterans with PTSD maintained attention longer on the fearful and disgusted expressions relative to the happy expression. This negativity bias was sustained over the course of the 3 s trials, and robustly distinguished veterans with PTSD from both veterans without PTSD and nonveteran controls. CONCLUSIONS: Dwelling on potential threat cues may reflect current PTSD symptoms, or it could reflect a cognitive vulnerability factor for PTSD."
"BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that the transition from experimental to regular smoking is facilitated by the influence of tobacco on affective and attentional mechanisms. The objective of this study was to examine affective and attentional responses in young adult smokers using fear-potentiated startle and prepulse inhibition. METHODS: Participants were 56 college nonsmokers, nonabstinent smokers, and overnight-abstinent smokers. The fear-potentiated startle test examined phasic responses to imminent threat cues and more sustained responses to unpredictable aversive events. Prepulse inhibition investigated responses to attended and ignored prepulse stimuli. RESULTS: Abstinent and nonabstinent smokers showed increased sustained potentiation of startle to contextual cues, compared to controls. Abstinent smokers showed increased fear-potentiated startle to threat cues, compared to nonsmokers. PPI did not discriminate between abstinent or nonabstinent smokers and controls. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that negative affectivity or anxiety is associated with smoking, particularly during short withdrawal. Potentiated startle may provide a valuable tool in understanding the biologic mechanisms underlying nicotine withdrawal and inform cessation and prevention efforts."
"BACKGROUND: In an aging society, many patients require long-term treatment. This fact is associated clearly with the simultaneous occurrence of lifestyle diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and even osteoarthritis. Concomitant medications, which are a common practice, pose a major threat of an interaction between these drugs. Very popular now ""fast way of life"" that makes people have less and less time to prepare well-balanced meals of high nutritional value. The result of this lifestyle is an increased need for supplementation preparations necessary vitamins and minerals. Given the wide availability of dietary supplements (shops, kiosks, petrol stations) raises the question about the possibility of an interaction between the uncontrolled intake of dietary supplements and medications received in the most common diseases of civilization. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the most important minerals (magnesium, potassium, calcium, zinc) contained in the popular nutritional supplements, the release also often used as an anti-pain, anti-inflammatory, diclofenac sodium from the different formulations. RESULTS: Among the many as sodium diclofenac selected two most common: film-coated tablets and sustained release capsules. The study showed a significant effect of minerals on the release of diclofenac sodium and differences that impact, depending on the test form of the drug."
"Over the past 3 decades, dengue has spread rapidly and has emerged as one of the world's most common mosquitoborne viral diseases. Although often found in tropical and semitropical areas, dengue is capable of being transmitted in temperate climates as well. Dengue is currently endemic to Mexico, most other Latin American countries, and parts of the Caribbean, and it has the potential to become reestablished as an endemic disease in the United States. In fact, sustained transmission of dengue has occurred in Florida within the past year. Conditions exist in the U.S. that could facilitate sustained dengue transmission, including environmental factors, competent mosquito vectors, limited vector and dengue surveillance, increased domestic outdoor daytime activities in warmer months, and low public awareness of the disease. If dengue were to be reestablished in the U.S., it could have significant medical, public health, and economic consequences for the country. The impact of dengue as a public health threat could be lessened through enhanced awareness and reporting of cases, increased support for vector surveillance and control programs, and a greater focus on vaccine development."
"Background: The number of people conducting cycling and skating sports in Switzerland is rising; likewise, we notice an increase in patients visiting our emergency department for adults due to push scooter accidents. In 2001, our emergency department published the first article worldwide on push scooter-related injuries. Nearly two decades later, we want to review the interim period-collect data, compare it with other studies and evaluate the current impact of push scooter accidents in our adult patient population. Objective: To investigate data on the incidence, severity, treatment and approximate costs of push scooter-related injuries in adults who presented to our emergency department from 2000 to 2017. Materials and methods: For this descriptive retrospective study, data were collected in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Inselspital (University Hospital), Berne, Switzerland, from October 2000 to September 2017. We used two clinical reporting systems during that period: Qualicare from 2000 to April 2012 and Ecare from May 2012 to 2017. Results: 165 patients were included, aged 16-80 years. The accidents were mainly classified as unspecified falls in 139 cases (84.24%). 21 patients (12.73%) were wearing a helmet at the time of the accident, while the remaining 144 (87.27%) were not. The most common injuries suffered were fractures in 73 patients (44.24%). 92 patients (55.76%) sustained an impact to the head. The most common treatment was surgery in the operating theatre (59 patients, 35.76%). The mean total cost per case was SFr7566.65 (emergency room visit, hospital stay and outpatient controls for the initial case). Conclusion: The incidence of push scooter-related injuries in adults in our patient population is small but rising. Nevertheless, the resulting injuries are potentially life-threatening and can lead to persistent medical impairment."
"Rabies is an acute, fatal viral disease that infects domestic and wild animals and is transmissible to humans. Worldwide, rabies kills over 55,000 people every year. The domestic dog plays a pivotal role in rabies transmission. Domestic dogs are not only part of our daily lives but also of our immediate surroundings, and this is reflected in the rise in pet dog ownership in developed and developing countries. This is important given that more frequent exposures and interactions at the animal-human interface increases the likelihood of contracting zoonotic diseases of companion animals. Despite existing vaccines and post-exposure prophylactic treatment, rabies remains a neglected disease that is poorly controlled throughout much of the developing world, particularly Africa and Asia, where most human rabies deaths occur. It is believed that with sustained international commitments, global elimination of rabies from domestic dog populations, the most dangerous vector to humans, is a realistic goal."
"It is widely thought that phasic and sustained responses to threat reflect dissociable circuits centered on the central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), the two major subdivisions of the central extended amygdala. Early versions of this hypothesis remain highly influential and have been incorporated into the National Institute of Mental Health Research Research Domain Criteria framework. However, new observations encourage a different perspective. Anatomical studies show that the Ce and BST form a tightly interconnected unit, where different kinds of threat-relevant information can be integrated and used to assemble states of fear and anxiety. Imaging studies in humans and monkeys show that the Ce and BST exhibit similar functional profiles. Both regions are sensitive to a range of aversive challenges, including uncertain or temporally remote threat; both covary with concurrent signs and symptoms of fear and anxiety; both show phasic responses to short-lived threat; and both show heightened activity during sustained exposure to diffusely threatening contexts. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that both regions can control the expression of fear and anxiety during sustained exposure to diffuse threat. These observations compel a reconsideration of the central extended amygdala's contributions to fear and anxiety and its role in neuropsychiatric disease."
"It is well established that anthropogenic chlorine-containing chemicals contribute to ozone layer depletion. The successful implementation of the Montreal Protocol has led to reductions in the atmospheric concentration of many ozone-depleting gases, such as chlorofluorocarbons. As a consequence, stratospheric chlorine levels are declining and ozone is projected to return to levels observed pre-1980 later this century. However, recent observations show the atmospheric concentration of dichloromethane-an ozone-depleting gas not controlled by the Montreal Protocol-is increasing rapidly. Using atmospheric model simulations, we show that although currently modest, the impact of dichloromethane on ozone has increased markedly in recent years and if these increases continue into the future, the return of Antarctic ozone to pre-1980 levels could be substantially delayed. Sustained growth in dichloromethane would therefore offset some of the gains achieved by the Montreal Protocol, further delaying recovery of Earth's ozone layer."
"Viral social media content has been heralded for its power to transform policy, but online responses are often derided as ""slacktivism."" This raises the questions of what drives viral communications and what is their effect on support for social change. We addressed these issues in relation to Twitter discussions about Aylan Kurdi, a child refugee who died en route to the European Union. We developed a longitudinal paradigm to analyze 41,253 tweets posted 1 week before the images of Aylan Kurdi emerged, the week they emerged, and 10 weeks afterward-at the time of the Paris terror attacks. Tweeting about death before the images emerged predicted tweeting about Aylan Kurdi, and this, sustained by discussion of harm and threat, predicted the expression of solidarity with refugees 10 weeks later. Results suggest that processes of normative conflict and communication can be intertwined in promoting support for social change."
"OBJECTIVE: Clinical anxiety is prevalent, highly comorbid with other conditions, and associated with significant medical morbidity, disability, and public health burden. Excessive attentional deployment toward threat is a transdiagnostic dimension of anxiety seen at both initial and sustained stages of threat processing. However, group-level observations of these phenomena mask considerable within-group heterogeneity that has been linked to treatment outcomes, suggesting that a transdiagnostic, individual differences approach may capture critical, clinically relevant information. METHOD: Seventy clinically anxious individuals were randomized to receive 8 sessions of attention bias modification (ABM; n = 41 included in analysis), a computer-based mechanistic intervention that specifically targets initial stages of threat processing, or a sham control (n = 21). Participants completed a mixed block/event-related functional MRI task optimized to discriminate transient from sustained neural responses to threat. RESULTS: Larger transient responses across a wide range of cognitive-affective regions (e.g., ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala) predicted better clinical outcomes following ABM, in both a priori anatomical regions and whole-brain analyses; sustained responses did not. A spatial pattern recognition algorithm using transient threat responses successfully discriminated the top quartile of ABM responders with 68% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Neural alterations occurring on the relatively transient timescale that is specifically targeted by ABM predict favorable clinical outcomes. Results inform how to expand on the initial promise of neurocognitive treatments like ABM by fine-tuning their clinical indications (e.g., through personalized mechanistic intervention relevant across diagnoses) and by increasing the range of mechanisms that can be targeted (e.g., through synergistic treatment combinations and/or novel neurocognitive training protocols designed to tackle identified predictors of nonresponse).

"BACKGROUND: Parental communication about the importance of reporting concussion symptoms can influence a child's attitudes about such reporting, and is likely related to perceived threat of concussion. However, parental investment in child sport achievement might impede this communication. PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between perceived threat of concussion and parent-child communication regarding concussion symptom reporting, and the potential interaction with parental pressure regarding child sport achievement. METHOD: A total of 236 parents of youth soccer players completed an anonymous online survey. RESULTS: There were greater odds of encouraging concussion reporting among parents who perceived that their child had a greater likelihood of sustaining a concussion ( OR = 1.03, 95% CI [1.01, 1.04]) and lower odds among parents who exhibited greater parental sport pressure ( OR = 0.88, 95% CI [0.78, 0.99]). Parents whose child had a prior concussion were much more likely to communicate with their child about concussion reporting ( OR = 7.86, 95% CI [3.00, 20.55]). CONCLUSION: Initiatives are needed to support healthy sport parenting, particularly focusing on parental encouragement of concussion reporting. Possible directions for concussion education for parents based on the results of this study include providing parents with concrete guidance about the important role they can play in encouraging their child to report symptoms of a concussion, communicating the athletic consequences of continued sport involvement while experiencing symptoms of a concussion, and using narrative messaging with exemplars to personalize the information for parents of youth who have not previously sustained a concussion."
"Mindfulness-based interventions have been heralded as promising means of alleviating chronic stress. While meta-analyses indicate that mindfulness-based interventions significantly reduce global measures of stress, how mindfulness-based interventions modulate the specific mechanisms underpinning chronic stress as operationalized by the National Institute of Mental Health research domain criteria (RDoC) of sustained threat has not yet been detailed in the literature. To address this knowledge gap, this article aims to (1) review evidence that mindfulness-based interventions ameliorate each of the 10 elements of behavioral dysregulation characterizing sustained threat via an array of mindful counter-regulatory strategies; (2) review evidence that mindfulness-based interventions modify biological domains implicated in sustained threat, such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, as well as brain circuits involved in attentional function, limbic reactivity, habit behavior, and the default mode network; and (3) integrate these findings into a novel conceptual framework of mindful self-regulation in the face of stress-the Mindfulness-to-Meaning Theory. Taken together, the extant body of scientific evidence suggests that the practice of mindfulness enhances a range biobehavioral factors implicated in adaptive stress coping and induces self-referential plasticity, leading to the ability to find meaning in adversity. These mechanistic findings can inform the treatment development process to optimize the next generation of mindfulness-based interventions for greater therapeutic efficacy."
"BACKGROUND: Having an exaggerated reactivity to threats that are uncertain (U-threat) may facilitate the initiation and maintenance of excessive alcohol use in some individuals. This abnormality may not just be a concomitant for alcohol use disorder (AUD), but also an endophenotype for AUD. METHOD: The aim of the current study was therefore to provide a preliminary test of whether U-threat is an endophenotype for AUD using several of the endophenotype criteria outlined by Gottesman and Gould (2003). Specifically, the study examined whether heightened U-threat reactivity is evidenced in those with: 1) current AUD; 2) remitted AUD (early and sustained remission examined separately); and 3) at-risk for AUD by virtue of having a positive family history of AUD. Participants (N = 147) completed a well-validated threat-of-shock task and startle eyeblink potentiation was collected as an index of aversive responding. Individuals and all available first-degree family members were diagnosed using structured clinical interviews. RESULTS: Individuals at-risk for AUD, with current AUD, and AUD in remission (both early and sustained) all displayed exaggerated reactivity to U-threat, but not predictable threat, compared with non-AUD controls. Moreover, there were no significant differences between the at-risk and any of the AUD groups indicating that exaggerated reactivity to U-threat is relatively state-independent and present regardless of current AUD disease status. CONCLUSIONS: The findings together highlight that exaggerated reactivity to U-threat may be a promising endophenotype for AUD that can aid in the refinement of mechanistic AUD disease models."
"Waterlogging is becoming a critical threat to plants growing in areas prone to flooding. Some plants adapt various morphological and biochemical alterations which are regulated transcriptionally to cope with the situation. A comparative study of waterlogging response in two different varieties of Mentha namely Mentha piperita and Mentha arvensis was performed. M. arvensis showed better response towards waterlogging in comparison to M. piperita. M. arvensis maintained a healthy posture by utilizing its carbohydrate content; also, it showed a flourished vegetative growth under waterlogged condition. Soluble protein, chlorophyll content, relative water content, and nitric oxide scavenging activity were comparatively more salient in M. arvensis during this hypoxia treatment. Lipid peroxidation was less in M. arvensis. M. arvensis also showed vigorous outgrowth of adventitious roots to assist waterlogging tolerance. To further investigate the possible gene transcripts involved in this response, we did cDNA subtraction of waterlogging treated M. piperita and M. arvensis seedlings. cDNA subtraction has identified thirty seven novel putative Expressed Sequence Tags which were further classified functionally. Functional classification revealed that maximum percentage of proteins belonged to hypothetical proteins followed by proteins involved in biosynthesis. Some of the identified ESTs were further quantified for their induced expression in M. arvensis in comparison to M. piperita through quantitative real-time PCR."
"Microbial infection has been considered as one of the most critical challenges in bioengineering applications especially in tissue regeneration, which engenders severe threat to public health. Herein, a hydrogel performing properties of rapid self-healing, on-demand antibiosis and controlled cargo release was fabricated by a simple assembly of Fe complex as the cross-linker and hyaluronic acid as the gel network. This hydrogel is able to locally degrade and release Fe(3+) to kill bacteria as needed because of hyaluronidase excreted by surrounding bacteria, resulting in efficient antibacterial activity against different types of bacteria. The sustained release property of certain types of growth factors was also observed from this hydrogel owing to its dense network. Moreover, this hydrogel could repeatedly heal itself in minutes because of the coordination interaction between Fe(3+) and COOH, exhibiting good potential in bioengineering applications on the exposed tissue, where the materials are easily damaged during daily life. When topically applied onto damaged mouse skin with infection of Staphylococcus aureus, the hydrogel is able to inhibit microbial infections, meanwhile promoting cutaneous regeneration, which formed new skin with no inflammation within a 10 day treatment. These results demonstrate the potential application of this self-healing hydrogel for the integrated therapy of antibiosis and tissue regeneration."
"Political conservatism is associated with an increased negativity bias, including increased attention and reactivity toward negative and threatening stimuli. Although the human amygdala has been implicated in the response to threatening stimuli, no studies to date have investigated whether conservatism is associated with altered amygdala function toward threat. Furthermore, although an influential theory posits that connectivity between the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is important in initiating the response to sustained or uncertain threat, whether individual differences in conservatism modulate this connectivity is unknown. To test whether conservatism is associated with increased reactivity in neural threat circuitry, we measured participants' self-reported social and economic conservatism and asked them to complete high-resolution fMRI scans while under threat of an unpredictable shock and while safe. We found that economic conservatism predicted greater connectivity between the BNST and a cluster of voxels in the left amygdala during threat vs safety. These results suggest that increased amygdala-BNST connectivity during threat may be a key neural correlate of the enhanced negativity bias found in conservatism."
"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB), is caused by the bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its a threat to humans since centuries. Depending on the type of TB, its treatment can last for 6-24 months which is a major cause for patients non-compliance and treatment failure. Many adverse effects are associated with the currently available TB medicines, and there has been no new anti-tuberculosis drug on the market for more than 50 year, as the drug development is very lengthy and budget consuming process.Development of the biocompatible nano drug delivery systems with the ability to minimize the side effects of the drugs, protection of the drug from enzymatic degradation. And most importantly the drug delivery systems which can deliver the drug at target site would increase the therapeutic efficacy. Nanovehicles with their tendency to release the drug in a sustained manner would result in the bioavalibilty of the drugs in the body for a longer period of time and this would reduce the dosing frequency in drug administration. The biocompatible nanovehicles with the properties like sustained release of drug of the target site, protection of the drug from physio-chemical degradation, reduction in dosing frequency, and prolong bioavailability of drug in the body would result in the shortening of the treatment duration. All of these factors would improve the patient compliance with chemotherapy of TB. RESULT: An anti-tuberculosis drug, 4-amino salicylic acid (4-ASA) was successfully intercalated into the interlamellae of zinc layered hydroxide (ZLH) via direct reaction with zinc oxide suspension. The X-ray diffraction patterns and FTIR analyses indicate that the molecule was successfully intercalated into the ZLH interlayer space with an average basal spacing of 24 A. Furthermore, TGA and DTG results show that the drug 4-ASA is stabilized in the interlayers by electrostatic interaction. The release of 4-ASA from the nanocomposite was found to be in a sustained manner. The nanocomposite treated with normal 3T3 cells shows it reduces cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Sustained release formulation of the nanocomposite, 4-ASA intercalated into zinc layered hydroxides, with its ease of preparation, sustained release of the active and less-toxic to the cell is a step forward for a more patient-friendly chemotherapy of Tuberculosis."
"BACKGROUND: Contemporary theories and evidence implicate defective emotion regulation in violent behaviour. The two psychiatric illnesses most implicated in violence are schizophrenia and antisocial personality disorder (APD). This study examined behavioural and brain abnormalities in violent men with schizophrenia or APD during anticipatory fear. METHOD: Fifty-three men [14 non-violent healthy controls, 13 with schizophrenia and a history of serious violence (VSZ), 13 with schizophrenia without a history of violence (SZ), 13 with APD and a history of serious violence] underwent blood-oxygenation-level-dependent fMRI during an experiment involving repeated presentations of 'safe' and 'threat of electric shock' conditions and provided ratings of shock anticipation and fear. Schizophrenia patients did not have co-morbid APD. RESULTS: VSZ participants reported the highest, and APD participants the lowest, level of shock anticipation and fear, with intermediate ratings by SZ and healthy participants. The violent, relative to non-violent, groups showed altered activity modulation in occipital and temporal regions, from early to latter parts of threat periods. Additionally, VSZ patients displayed exaggerated whereas APD patients showed attenuated thalamic-striatal activity during latter threat periods. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant activity in occipital and temporal regions when exposed to sustained visual threat cues is associated with a predisposition to violence in both schizophrenia and APD. This common biological deficit, however, appears to arise from dissimilar behavioural mechanisms related to differences in the strength of aversive conditioning and behavioural response to sustained threat cues (enhanced in VSZ; attenuated in APD), also reflected in opposite patterns of alternations in thalamic-striatal activity, in these two disorders."
"In 2005, a year after highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks in Thailand, the Thai Government issued a National Strategy Plan for Pandemic Influenza Preparedness, a major objective of which was the domestic production of seasonal influenza vaccine. It was considered that sustained influenza vaccine production was the best guarantee of a pandemic vaccine in the event of a future pandemic. The Government decided to provide funds to establish an industrial-scale influenza vaccine production plant, and gave responsibility for this challenging project to the Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO). In 2007, with support from the World Health Organization (WHO), the GPO started to develop egg-based, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in a renovated pilot plant. In early 2009, during the second year of the project, the GPO turned its attention to develop a pandemic live attenuated influenza vaccine (PLAIV) against the influenza A (H1N1) virus. By December 2010, the H1N1 PLAIV had successfully completed Phase II clinical trials and was awaiting registration approval from the Thai Food and Drug Administration (TFDA). The GPO has also started to develop an H5N2 PLAIV, which is expected to enter clinical trials in January 2011. The next step in 2011 will be the development and clinical evaluation of seasonal LAIV. To meet the needs of the national seasonal influenza vaccination programme, the GPO aims to produce 2 million doses of trivalent IIV in 2012 and progressively increase production to the maximum annual capacity of 10 million doses. This article relates how influenza vaccine production capacity was developed and how major challenges are being met in an expeditious manner, with strong local and global commitment."
"BACKGROUND: Research supports the anxiolytic effect of exercise, but the mechanism underlying this effect is unclear. This study examines the influence of exercise in healthy controls on two distinct defensive states implicated in anxiety disorders: fear, a phasic response to a predictable threat, and anxiety, a sustained response to an unpredictable threat. METHODS: Thirty-four healthy volunteers (17 male, age M = 26.18, SD = 5.6) participated in sessions of exercise (biking at 60-70% of heart rate reserve) and control (biking at 10-20% of heart rate reserve) activity for 30 min, separated by 1 week. Threat responses were measured by eyeblink startle and assessed with the ""Neutral-Predictable-Unpredictable threat test,"" which includes a neutral (N) and two threat conditions, one with predictable (P) and one with unpredictable (U) shock. RESULTS: Results show that exercise versus control activity reduces startle potentiation during unpredictable threat (P = .031), but has no effect on startle potentiation during predictable threat (P = .609). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that exercise reduces defensive response to unpredictable, but not predictable, threat, a dissociation that may help inform clinical indications for this behavioral intervention, as well as provide clues to its underlying neurobehavioral mechanisms."
"It is generally thought to be adaptive that fear relevant stimuli in the environment can capture and hold our attention; and in psychopathology attentional allocation is thought to be cue-specific. Such hypervigilance toward threatening cues or difficulty to disengage attention from threat has been demonstrated for a variety of stimuli, for example, toward evolutionary prepared animals or toward socially relevant facial expressions. Usually, specific stimuli have been examined in individuals with particular fears (e.g., animals in animal fearful and faces in socially fearful participants). However, different kinds of stimuli are rarely examined in one study. Thus, it is unknown how different categories of threatening stimuli compete for attention and how specific kinds of fears modulate these attentional processes. In this study, we used a free viewing paradigm: pairs of pictures with threat-related content (spiders or angry faces) or neutral content (butterflies or neutral faces) were presented side by side (i.e., spiders and angry faces, angry and neutral faces, spiders and butterflies, butterflies and neutral faces). Eye-movements were recorded while spider fearful, socially anxious, or non-anxious participants viewed the picture pairs. Results generally replicate the finding that unpleasant pictures more effectively capture attention in the beginning of a trial compared to neutral pictures. This effect was more pronounced in spider fearful participants: the higher the fear the quicker they were in looking at spiders. This was not the case for high socially anxious participants and pictures of angry faces. Interestingly, when presented next to each other, there was no preference in initial orientation for either spiders or angry faces. However, neutral faces were looked at more quickly than butterflies. Regarding sustained attention, we found no general preference for unpleasant pictures compared to neutral pictures."
"Objective: Some studies have shown that diagnosis threat (DT) could negatively impact the cognitive performance of undergraduate students who had sustained a mild traumatic brain injury. This study was designed to examine DT in people with acquired brain injury (ABI). As a second goal, we investigated the effect of stereotype lift as a way to overcome DT's harmful impact. The purpose of this study was also to examine the mechanisms mediating stereotype effects. Method: People with ABI and control participants were assigned to one of three conditions: DT, cognitive-neutral (in which the cognitive status of participants with ABI and the cognitive characteristics of the tasks were deemphasized), and stereotype lift (in which a downward comparison was made with another neurological group). Participants then completed neuropsychological tasks. Negative emotions, intrusive thoughts, task expectancy, and self-efficacy were assessed for mediation analyses. Results: Instructions impacted the performance of people with ABI, but not control participants. Compared to the cognitive-neutral condition, participants with ABI in the DT condition performed worse on memory and executive tasks (but not on attention tasks). These effects were mediated by negative emotions. There was no increase in performance in the stereotype lift condition compared to the DT condition. Conclusions: This study showed that DT can aggravate the cognitive difficulties of people with ABI during neuropsychological assessment. The mediating role of negative emotions and the selective impact of DT on tasks that rely heavily on executive functioning are discussed in the light of the stereotype threat model."
"Highly influential models have proposed that responses to different types of threat are mediated by partially segregated neural systems, with the amygdala underlying phasic responses to explicit threat (fear) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) mediating sustained responses to ambiguous threat (anxiety). However, newer models have suggested similar recruitment of both regions across a wide spectrum of threat. Therefore, to empirically test these models and further elucidate the activation profiles and connectivity patterns of the amygdala and the BNST during threat processing, 20 participants were scanned using high-resolution fMRI (1.5 mm(3)). Using fearful faces and human screams as aversive stimuli, two threat conditions were created: Explicit Threat in which threats were certain and predictable (fear) and Ambiguous Threat in which threats were uncertain and unpredictable (anxiety). Results indicated that, although the amygdala and the BNST both showed heightened engagement across both threat conditions, the amygdala showed preferential engagement during Explicit Threat and displayed functional connectivity with regions involved in stimulus processing and motor response. By contrast, the BNST preferentially responded during Ambiguous Threat and exhibited functional connectivity with prefrontal regions underlying interoception and rumination. Furthermore, correlations with questionnaires measuring trait anxiety, worry, and rumination suggested that individual differences in affective style play a modulatory role in regional recruitment and network connectivity during threat processing."
"UNLABELLED: Vibrio cholerae, the cause of an often fatal infectious diarrhea, remains a large global public health threat. Little is known about the challenges V. cholerae encounters during colonization of the intestines, which genes are important for overcoming these challenges, and how these genes are regulated. In this study, we examined the V. cholerae response to nitric oxide (NO), an antibacterial molecule derived during infection from various sources, including host inducible NO synthase (iNOS). We demonstrate that the regulatory protein NorR regulates the expression of NO detoxification genes hmpA and nnrS, and that all three are critical for resisting low levels of NO stress under microaerobic conditions in vitro. We also show that prxA, a gene previously thought to be important for NO detoxification, plays no role in NO resistance under microaerobic conditions and is upregulated by H(2)O(2), not NO. Furthermore, in an adult mouse model of prolonged colonization, hmpA and norR were important for the resistance of both iNOS- and non-iNOS-derived stresses. Our data demonstrate that NO detoxification systems play a critical role in the survival of V. cholerae under microaerobic conditions resembling those of an infectious setting and during colonization of the intestines over time periods similar to that of an actual V. cholerae infection. IMPORTANCE: Little is known about what environmental stresses Vibrio cholerae, the etiologic agent of cholera, encounters during infection, and even less is known about how V. cholerae senses and counters these stresses. Most prior studies of V. cholerae infection relied on the 24-h infant mouse model, which does not allow the analysis of survival over time periods comparable to that of an actual V. cholerae infection. In this study, we used a sustained mouse colonization model to identify nitric oxide resistance as a function critical for the survival of V. cholerae in the intestines and further identified the genes responsible for sensing and detoxifying this stress."
"An influential framework suggests that the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is involved in phasic responses to threat, while the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) mediates sustained anxiety. However, this model has been questioned, proposing that the role of the BNST is not limited to sustained threat contexts. Rather, amygdala and BNST also seem to work in concert in the processing of discrete and briefly presented threat-related stimuli, likely dependent on inter-individual differences in anxiety. A direct test of this assumption with sufficient experimental power is missing in human research and the degree to which individual differences in trait anxiety moderate phasic responses and functional connectivity of amygdala and BNST during threat processing remains unclear. The current event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated activation and connectivity of amygdala and BNST, as well as modulating effects of trait anxiety, during processing of briefly presented threat-related relative to neutral standardized pictures in 93 psychiatrically healthy individuals. Both amygdala and BNST activation was increased during presentation of threat-related relative to neutral pictures. Furthermore, functional connectivity between BNST and amygdala in response to threat was positively associated with trait anxiety. These findings suggest that amygdala and BNST form a functional unit during phasic threat processing whereby their connectivity is shaped by inter-individual differences in trait anxiety."
"Threat induces a state of sustained anxiety that can disrupt cognitive processing, and, reciprocally, cognitive processing can modulate an anxiety response to threat. These effects depend on the level of cognitive engagement, which itself varies as a function of task difficulty. In adults, we recently showed that induced anxiety impaired working memory accuracy at low and medium but not high load. Conversely, increasing the task load reduced the physiological correlates of anxiety (anxiety-potentiated startle). The present work examines such threat-cognition interactions as a function of age. We expected threat to more strongly impact working memory in younger individuals by virtue of putatively restricted cognitive resources and weaker emotion regulation. This was tested by examining the influence of age on the interaction of anxiety and working memory in 25 adolescents (10 to 17 years) and 25 adults (22 to 46 years). Working memory load was manipulated using a verbal n-back task. Anxiety was induced using the threat of an aversive loud scream and measured via eyeblink startle. Findings revealed that, in both age groups, accuracy was lower during threat than safe conditions at low and medium but not high load, and reaction times were faster during threat than safe conditions at high load but did not differ at other loads. Additionally, anxiety-potentiated startle was greater during low and medium than high load. Thus, the interactions of anxiety with working memory appear similar in adolescents and adults. Whether these similarities reflect common neural mechanisms would need to be assessed using functional neuroimaging."
"Stimuli of high emotional significance such as social threat cues are preferentially processed in the human brain. However, there is an ongoing debate whether or not these stimuli capture attention automatically and weaken the processing of concurrent stimuli in the visual field. This study examined continuous fluctuations of electrocortical facilitation during competition of two spatially separated facial expressions in high and low socially anxious individuals. Two facial expressions were flickered for 3000 msec at different frequencies (14 and 17.5 Hz) to separate the electrocortical signals evoked by the competing stimuli (""frequency tagging""). Angry faces compared to happy and neutral expressions were associated with greater electrocortical facilitation over visual areas only in the high socially anxious individuals. This finding was independent of the respective competing stimulus. Heightened electrocortical engagement in socially anxious participants was present in the first second of stimulus viewing and was sustained for the entire presentation period. These results, based on a continuous measure of attentional resource allocation, support the view that stimuli of high personal significance are associated with early and sustained prioritized sensory processing. These cues, however, do not interfere with the electrocortical processing of a spatially separated concurrent face, suggesting that they are effective at capturing attention, but are weak competitors for resources."
"Owing to the expanding globalization, the trans-boundary spread of an epizootic can easily result from uncontrolled animal movements and human traffic. Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a major trans-boundary disease in most Asian countries. Its sporadic re-emergence suggests that collaborative FMD control strategies should be uniformly implemented in endemic countries to ensure the overall national herd vaccination coverage, biocontainment when outbreaks occur, and strict biosecurity control of animal movement between countries. Sustained commitments from governments, cooperative diplomatic relationships, and public awareness campaigns are critical to FMD control, to ensure collaboration among veterinarians, traders and farmers throughout Southeast Asia (SEA). Recently, highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (HP-PRRS) and porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) spread from China to Southeast Asian countries, causing major economic losses. Foot and mouth disease, HP-PRRS, and PED currently remain endemic and may continue to sporadically re-emerge, owing to inadequate public health management and/or biosecurity failures. Therefore, the risk factors must be identified to better understand the epidemiology of these diseases in an effort to develop effective control measures. International coordination through the establishment of a collaborative network supported by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) should be implemented to prevent trans-boundary transmission among countries. This review discusses trans-boundary swine diseases of particular importance to SEA, including FMD, HP-PRRS and PED, with a primary focus on major factors contributing to the spread of these diseases and important control measures, reflecting the impact of globalization on disease control and surveillance."
"BACKGROUND: Recent changes in the United States (US) economy have radically disrupted revenue generation among many institutions within higher education within the US. Chief among these disruptions has been fallout associated with the financial crisis of 2008-2009, which triggered a change in the US higher education environment from a period of relative munificence to a prolonged period of scarcity. The hardest hit by this disruption have been smaller, less wealthy institutions which tend to lack the necessary reserves to financially weather the economic storm. Interestingly, a review of institutional effectiveness among these institutions revealed that while many are struggling, some institutions have found ways to not only successfully cope with the impact of declining revenue, but have been able to capitalize on the disruption and thrive. OBJECTIVE: Organizational response is an important factor in successfully coping with conditions of organizational decline. The study examined the impacts of organizational response on institutional effectiveness among higher education institutions experiencing organizational decline. The study's research question asked why some US higher educational institutions are more resilient at coping with organizational decline than other institutions operating within the same segment of the higher education sector. More specifically, what role does organizational resilience have in helping smaller, private non-profit institutions cope and remain effective during organizational decline? PARTICIPANTS: A total of 141 US smaller, private non-profit higher educational institutions participated in the study; specifically, the study included responses from participant institutions' key administrators. METHODS: 60-item survey evaluated administrator responses corresponding to organizational response and institutional effectiveness. Factor analysis was used to specify the underlying structures of rigidity response, resilience response, and institutional effectiveness. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the direct and interaction effects between organizational decline, organizational rigidity response, organizational resilience response, and institutional effectiveness, controlling for age of institution and level of endowment. RESULTS: The study validated previous threat-rigidity response findings that organizational decline alone does not adversely impact institutional effectiveness. The direct effect of Goal-Directed Solution Seeking and Role Dependency organizational resilience factors had a positive, significant correlation with the Student Personal Development institutional effectiveness factor. The interactive effect of Goal-Directed Solution Seeking organizational resilience factor during organizational decline had a positive, significant correlation with the Professional Development and Quality of Faculty institutional effectiveness factor. The interactive effect of Avoidance during organizational decline had a positive, significant correlation with the Faculty and Administrator Employment Satisfaction institutional effectiveness factor. The interactive effect of Diminished Innovation, Morale, and Leader Credibility rigidity response factor and Avoidance organizational resilience factor during organizational decline had a positive, significant correlation with the Professional Development and Quality of Faculty institutional effectiveness factor. Lastly, the interactive effect of Increased Scapegoating of Leaders, Interest group Activities, and Conflict rigidity response factor and Avoidance organizational resilience factor during organizational decline had a positive, significant correlation with the Faculty and Administrator Employment Satisfaction institutional effectiveness factor. CONCLUSIONS: Factors of organizational resilience were found to have a positive effect among smaller, private non-profit higher educational institutions associated with this study toward sustaining institutional effectiveness during organizational decline. Specifically, the organizational resilience factors of Goal-Directed Solution Seeking (i.e., mission-driven solutions) and Avoidance (i.e., skepticism toward new ideas) play a significant, collaborative role among smaller, private non-profit higher educational institutions when it comes to sustaining institutional effectiveness during organizational decline."
"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the frequency of injuries and fatalities associated with terrorist bomb explosions in the city of Karachi from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2011. Moreover, this study is aimed to determine age and sex vulnerability among the victims of blast explosion. STUDY DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted. PLACE: The study was carried out at mortuaries and medicolegal sections at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, Civil Hospital and Abbasi-Shaheed Hospital Karachi, the three main hospitals, which cater to all these cases of Karachi. DURATION OF STUDY: The study included all bomb blast victims examined and autopsied from January 2007 to December 2011 at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, Civil Hospital and Abbassi Shaheed Hospital Karachi. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Details of 1142 cases were collected for those medicolegal deaths and injured persons, identified to be the victims of bomb blasts from January 2007 to December 2011. Data were collected on a preformed proforma from the mortuaries and medicolegal sections of these three public sector hospitals. The variables investigated include age, gender, year-wise distribution of the injured and the dead along with the cause of death and body parts injured in survivors. RESULTS: Out of the total 11,109 autopsies during the study period, 249 (2.24%) were carried out on deaths due to bomb blasts. Similarly, 135,065 injury cases were reported during the study period out of which 893 (0.66%) cases were due to bomb blasts. An initial peak in the year 2007, followed by a decline in 2008 and since then a steady rise of bomb blast incidences with casualties and fatalities, has been observed. The highest numbers of injured victims were reported in the year 2010 and fatalities in 2007. Among 1142 cases, 95.18% were male and 4.82% female with a male to female ratio of 19.76:1. Persons of ages between 15 and 45 years were chiefly involved. Shock due to multiple injuries was the leading cause of death, followed by head injury with or without haemorrhage. The lower extremities sustained the highest number of injuries in survivors, followed by the upper extremities. CONCLUSION: Fatalities and casualties due to explosions are increasing each year. The pattern of injuries indicates open-air bombing in Karachi. Males of the age group 15-45 years are the main victims. The forensic speciality needs to understand their role of correct certification, helpful to law enforcement agencies."
"The snow leopard (Uncia uncia) is in danger of extinction. Killing to protect livestock is among the primary causes of its decline. Efforts to mitigate this threat have focused on balancing the need to conserve the snow leopard with the needs of local people in snow leopard habitat, many of whom rely on raising livestock for their livelihoods. Conservation of the snow leopard has the characteristics of a public good, and outside funding is required to support conservation efforts. There are 5 commonly discussed approaches to resolving this issue: (1) direct payments for conservation, (2) investments in protection from predation, (3) damage compensation payments, (4) investments in better livestock husbandry, and (5) leases of pastureland for wild prey. After a review of these 5 conservation strategies, an economic-ecologic model, which includes the interactions between the snow leopard, its wild prey, and livestock, is used to evaluate the 2 most promising conservation strategies. The model reveals that investments in protection from predation and leases of pastureland for wild prey are effective but only in delaying the eventual extinction of the snow leopard. To preserve the snow leopard, these approaches must be applied more aggressively and new ones explored."
"The medial division of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA(M)) and the lateral division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST(L)) are closely related. Both receive projections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and both project to brain areas that mediate fear-influenced behaviors. In contrast to CeA(M) however, initial attempts to implicate the BNST in conditioned fear responses were largely unsuccessful. More recent studies have shown that the BNST does participate in some types of anxiety and stress responses. Here, we review evidence suggesting that the CeA(M) and BNST(L) are functionally complementary, with CeA(M) mediating short- but not long-duration threat responses (i.e., phasic fear) and BNST(L) mediating long- but not short-duration responses (sustained fear or 'anxiety'). We also review findings implicating the stress-related peptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in sustained but not phasic threat responses, and attempt to integrate these findings into a neural circuit model which accounts for these and related observations."
"Fear is elicited by imminent threat and leads to phasic fear responses with selective attention, whereas anxiety is characterized by a sustained state of heightened vigilance due to uncertain danger. In the present study, we investigated attention mechanisms in fear and anxiety by adapting the NPU-threat test to measure steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs). We investigated ssVEPs across no aversive events (N), predictable aversive events (P), and unpredictable aversive events (U), signaled by four-object arrays (30s). In addition, central cues were presented during all conditions but predictably signaled imminent threat only during the P condition. Importantly, cues and context events were flickered at different frequencies (15Hz vs. 20Hz) in order to disentangle respective electrocortical responses. The onset of the context elicited larger electrocortical responses for U compared to P context. Conversely, P cues elicited larger electrocortical responses compared to N cues. Interestingly, during the presence of the P cue, visuocortical processing of the concurrent context was also enhanced. The results support the notion of enhanced initial hypervigilance to unpredictable compared to predictable threat contexts, while predictable cues show electrocortical enhancement of the cues themselves but additionally a boost of context processing."
"The visual processing of emotional faces is influenced by individual's level of stress and anxiety. Valence unspecific affective processing is expected to be influenced by predictability of threat. Using a design of phasic fear (predictable threat), sustained anxiety (unpredictable threat) and safety (no threat), we investigated the magnetoencephalographic correlates and temporal dynamics of emotional face processing in a sample of phobic patients. Compared to non-anxious controls, phobic individuals revealed decreased parietal emotional attention processes during affective processing at mid-latency and late processing stages. While control subjects showed increasing parietal processing of the facial stimuli in line with decreasing threat predictability, phobic subjects revealed the opposite pattern. Decreasing threat predictability also led to increasing neural activity in the orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at mid-latency stages. Additionally, unpredictability of threat lead to higher subjective discomfort compared to predictability of threat and no threat safety condition. Our findings indicate that visual processing of emotional information is influenced by both stress induction and pathologic anxiety."
"The current study investigated links between trauma exposure, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and inhibitory control assessed using a modified version of the visual flanker task. The study had three aims: (1) specifically confirm general non-affective deficits in sustained attention in PTSD; (2) probe the influence of threatening and trauma-related stimuli on inhibitory control; and (3) explore neural correlates connecting PTSD, facets of dissociation, and inhibitory control. Participants with PTSD (n=16), trauma-exposed individuals without PTSD (TE; n=14), and healthy controls (n=15) discriminated line orientations while ignoring temporally flanking lines and images depicting threatening or non-threatening scenes or faces. Electrophysiological recordings were made during task performance. Relative to TE participants, PTSD participants had poor sustained non-affective attention, but nevertheless exhibited greater inhibition of distractors (i.e., high event-related potential [ERP] Rejection Positivity [RP]) to threatening (versus non-threatening) stimuli. RP was associated with greater self-reported depersonalization in PTSD participants, but with less depersonalization in TE participants. Dipole source analysis localized RP to the posterior cingulate cortex in both PTSD and TE (and healthy controls), but with an additional source in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in TE, components of the default mode network. Results suggest a paradox in the executive control of distraction in PTSD: Whereas individuals with PTSD experience a general impairment in non-affective inhibitory control, their enhanced control of threat is associated with more severe symptoms of dissociation."
"Panic disorder is characterized by sudden, repeated, and unexpected attacks of intense fear and overwhelming anxiety about when another attack may strike. Patients with panic disorder and healthy individuals with a history of panic attacks show a hypersensitivity to unpredictable threats, suggesting a possible link between panic and sustained anxiety. The purpose of this study was to determine the degree to which induced symptoms of panic relate to fear and anxiety, as well as activity in the neural systems that mediate and regulate these affective states. Psychological and physiological symptoms of panic were assessed during an 8-min 7.5% CO2 challenge task. Psychological, physiological, and neural symptoms of fear and anxiety were measured during two sessions (one psychophysiology and one functional magnetic resonance imaging where subjects experienced several blocks of no threat (N), predictable shock (P), and unpredictable shock (U; NPU threat task). We used a principle component analysis to characterize panic susceptibility (PS), and found that PS significantly predicted dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activity to the unpredictable cue during the NPU threat task. When examining the weighted beta coefficients from this analysis, we observed that self-reported fear/anxiety during the CO2 challenge negatively loaded onto dlPFC activity during the NPU task. Consistent with this observation, dlPFC activity during the unpredictable cue was also negatively correlated with anxiety during the NPU sessions. Together, these results suggest that panic symptoms and anxiety are regulated by the same prefrontal cognitive control system."
"Sri Lanka has reached zero indigenous malaria cases in November 2012, two years before its targeted deadline for elimination. Currently, the biggest threat to the elimination efforts are the risk of resurgence of malaria due to imported cases. This paper describes two clusters of imported malaria infections reported in 2013 and 2014, one among a group of Pakistani asylum-seekers resident in Sri Lanka, and the other amongst local fishermen who returned from Sierra Leone. The two clusters studied reveal the potential impact of imported malaria on the risk of reintroducing the disease, as importation is the only source of malaria in the country at present. In the event of a case occurring, detection is a major challenge both amongst individuals returning from malaria endemic countries and the local population, as malaria is fast becoming a ""forgotten"" disease amongst health care providers. In spite of a very good coverage of diagnostic services (microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests) throughout the country, malaria is being repeatedly overlooked by health care providers even when individuals present with fever and a recent history of travel to a malaria endemic country. Given the high receptivity to malaria in previously endemic areas of the country due to the prevalence of the vector mosquito, such cases pose a significant threat for the reintroduction of malaria to Sri Lanka. The challenges faced by the Anti Malaria Campaign and measures taken to prevent the resurgence of malaria are discussed here."
"The relative importance of influenza virus transmission via aerosols is not fully understood, but experimental data suggest that aerosol transmission may represent a critical mode of influenza virus spread among humans. Decades ago, prototypical laboratory strains of influenza were shown to persist in aerosols; however, there is a paucity of data available covering currently circulating influenza viruses, which differ significantly from their predecessors. In this study, we evaluated the longevity of influenza viruses in aerosols generated in the laboratory. We selected a panel of H1 viruses that exhibit diverse transmission profiles in the ferret model, including four human isolates of swine origin (referred to as variant) and a seasonal strain. By measuring the ratio of viral RNA to infectious virus maintained in aerosols over time, we show that influenza viruses known to transmit efficiently through the air display enhanced stability in an aerosol state for prolonged periods compared to those viruses that do not transmit as efficiently. We then assessed whether H1 influenza virus was still capable of infecting and causing disease in ferrets after being aged in suspended aerosols. Ferrets exposed to very low levels of influenza virus (</=17 PFU) in aerosols aged for 15 or 30 min became infected, with five of six ferrets shedding virus in nasal washes at titers on par with ferrets who inhaled higher doses of unaged influenza virus. We describe here an underreported characteristic of influenza viruses, stability in aerosols, and make a direct connection to the role this characteristic plays in influenza transmission.IMPORTANCE Each time a swine influenza virus transmits to a human, it provides an opportunity for the virus to acquire adaptations needed for sustained human-to-human transmission. Here, we use aerobiology techniques to test the stability of swine-origin H1 subtype viruses in aerosols and evaluate their infectivity in ferrets. Our results show that highly transmissible influenza viruses display enhanced stability in an aerosol state compared to viruses that do not transmit as efficiently. Similar to human-adapted strains, swine-origin influenza viruses are infectious in ferrets at low doses even after prolonged suspension in the air. These data underscore the risk of airborne swine-origin influenza viruses and support the need for continued surveillance and refinement of innovative laboratory methods to investigate mammalian exposure to inhaled pathogens. Determination of the molecular markers that affect the longevity of airborne influenza viruses will improve our ability to quickly identify emerging strains that present the greatest threat to public health."
"Threat detection is essential for protecting individuals from adverse situations, in which a network of amygdala, limbic regions and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) regions are involved in fear processing. Excitability regulation in the dmPFC might be crucial for fear processing, while abnormal patterns could lead to mental illness. Notwithstanding, non-invasive paradigms to measure excitability regulation during fear processing in humans are missing. To address this challenge we adapted an approach for excitability characterization, combining electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the dmPFC during an instructed fear paradigm, to dynamically dissect its role in fear processing. Event-related (ERP) and TMS-evoked potentials (TEP) were analyzed to trace dmPFC excitability. We further linked the excitability regulation patterns to individual MRI-derived gray matter structural integrity of the fear network. Increased cortical excitability was demonstrated to threat (T) processing in comparison to no-threat (NT), reflected by increased amplitude of evoked potentials. Furthermore, TMS at dmPFC enhanced the evoked responses during T processing, while the structural integrity of the dmPFC and amygdala predicted the excitability regulation patterns to fear processing. The dmPFC takes a special role during fear processing by dynamically regulating excitability. The applied paradigm can be used to non-invasively track response abnormalities to threat stimuli in healthy subjects or patients with mental disorders."
"Gender-based stereotypes undermine females' performance on challenging math tests, but how do they influence their ability to learn from the errors they make? Females under stereotype threat or non-threat were presented with accuracy feedback after each problem on a GRE-like math test, followed by an optional interactive tutorial that provided step-wise problem-solving instruction. Event-related potentials tracked the initial detection of the negative feedback following errors [feedback related negativity (FRN), P3a], as well as any subsequent sustained attention/arousal to that information [late positive potential (LPP)]. Learning was defined as success in applying tutorial information to correction of initial test errors on a surprise retest 24-h later. Under non-threat conditions, emotional responses to negative feedback did not curtail exploration of the tutor, and the amount of tutor exploration predicted learning success. In the stereotype threat condition, however, greater initial salience of the failure (FRN) predicted less exploration of the tutor, and sustained attention to the negative feedback (LPP) predicted poor learning from what was explored. Thus, under stereotype threat, emotional responses to negative feedback predicted both disengagement from learning and interference with learning attempts. We discuss the importance of emotion regulation in successful rebound from failure for stigmatized groups in stereotype-salient environments."
"Testosterone plays an important role in social threat processing. Recent evidence suggests that testosterone administration has socially anxiolytic effects, but it remains unknown whether this involves early vigilance or later, more sustained, processing-stages. We investigated the acute effects of testosterone administration on social threat processing in 19 female patients with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and 19 healthy controls. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during an emotional Stroop task with subliminally presented faces. Testosterone induced qualitative changes in early ERPs (<200ms after stimulus onset) in both groups. An initial testosterone-induced spatial shift reflected a change in the basic processing (N170/VPP) of neutral faces, which was followed by a shift for angry faces suggesting a decrease in early threat bias. These findings suggest that testosterone specifically affects early automatic social information processing. The decreased attentional bias for angry faces explains how testosterone can decrease threat avoidance, which is particularly relevant for SAD."
"Patients with panic and post-traumatic stress disorders seem to show increased psychophysiological reactions to conditions of unpredictable (U) threat, which has been discussed as a neurobiological marker of elevated levels of sustained fear in these disorders. Interestingly, a recent study found that the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) is correlated to the successful regulation of sustained fear during U threat. Therefore this study aimed to examine the potential use of non-invasive brain stimulation to foster the rIFG by means of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in order to reduce psychophysiological reactions to U threat. Twenty six participants were randomly assigned into an anodal and sham stimulation group in a double-blinded manner. Anodal and cathodal electrodes (7 * 5 cm) were positioned right frontal to target the rIFG. Stimulation intensity was I = 2 mA applied for 20 min during a task including U threat conditions (NPU-task). The effects of the NPU paradigm were measured by assessing the emotional startle modulation and the skin conductance response (SCR) at the outset of the different conditions. We found a significant interaction effect of condition x tDCS for the SCR (F (2,48) = 6.3, p < 0.01) without main effects of condition and tDCS. Post hoc tests revealed that the increase in SCR from neutral (N) to U condition was significantly reduced in verum compared to the sham tDCS group (t (24) = 3.84, p < 0.001). Our results emphasize the causal role of rIFG for emotional regulation and the potential use of tDCS to reduce apprehension during U threat conditions and therefore as a treatment for anxiety disorders."
"The amplitude of the acoustic startle response is increased when elicited in the presence of brief cues that predict shock (fear-potentiated startle) and also when elicited during sustained exposure to bright light (light-enhanced startle). Although both effects are thought to reflect fear or anxiety, their neuroanatomical substrates differ. Although fear-potentiated startle is disrupted by reversible inactivation of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) but not the closely related bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), light-enhanced startle is disrupted by BNST inactivation but not by CeA inactivation. Intraventricular infusions of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) also increase startle (CRF-enhanced startle) and this effect is mediated by CRF receptors within the BNST, with no involvement of the CeA. Together, these observations suggest that CeA- and BNST-dependent fear and anxiety may be differentially sensitive to CRF receptor blockade. We tested this by orally administering the novel, potent, and selective CRF-R1 antagonist GSK876008 to rats before CRF-enhanced, light-enhanced, or fear-potentiated startle testing. GSK876008 disrupted CRF-enhanced startle with a linear dose-response curve, and light-enhanced startle with a U-shaped dose-response curve, but did not disrupt fear-potentiated startle to a visual stimulus at any dose tested, and even augmented the response in some animals. GSK876008 also disrupted shock-related 'baseline' startle increases, which may have reflected context conditioning (shown elsewhere to also be BNST-dependent). Overall, these results suggest that short-duration CeA-dependent threat responses can be pharmacologically dissociated from longer duration BNST-dependent responses in terms of their sensitivity to CRF1 receptor antagonists."
"The underpinning theme of the 2016 INTEREST Conference held in Yaounde, Cameroon, 3-6 May 2016 was ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. Focused primarily on HIV treatment, pathogenesis and prevention research in resource-limited settings, the conference attracted 369 active delegates from 34 countries, of which 22 were in Africa. Presentations on treatment optimization, acquired drug resistance, care of children and adolescents, laboratory monitoring and diagnostics, implementation challenges, HIV prevention, key populations, vaccine and cure, hepatitis C, mHealth, financing the HIV response and emerging pathogens, were accompanied by oral, mini-oral and poster presentations. Spirited plenary debates on the UNAIDS 90-90-90 treatment cascade goal and on antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis took place. Joep Lange career guidance sessions and grantspersonship sessions attracted early career researchers. At the closing ceremony, the Yaounde Declaration called on African governments; UNAIDS; development, bilateral, and multilateral partners; and civil society to adopt urgent and sustained approaches to end HIV by 2030."
"Chikungunya fever is a mosquito-borne infection for which no cure or vaccine is available. It made its first appearance in the Americas in December 2013. Seven months later, two locally acquired cases of the disease emerged in the United States. The emergence of chikungunya fever cases in the Americas emphasizes the need for sustained vector control, clear public health information, and disease awareness and surveillance."
"Although predators influence behavior of prey, analyses of electronic tracking data in marine environments rarely consider how predators affect the behavior of tracked animals. We collected an unprecedented dataset by synchronously tracking predator (killer whales, [Formula: see text] = 1; representing a family group) and prey (narwhal, [Formula: see text] = 7) via satellite telemetry in Admiralty Inlet, a large fjord in the Eastern Canadian Arctic. Analyzing the movement data with a switching-state space model and a series of mixed effects models, we show that the presence of killer whales strongly alters the behavior and distribution of narwhal. When killer whales were present (within about 100 km), narwhal moved closer to shore, where they were presumably less vulnerable. Under predation threat, narwhal movement patterns were more likely to be transiting, whereas in the absence of threat, more likely resident. Effects extended beyond discrete predatory events and persisted steadily for 10 d, the duration that killer whales remained in Admiralty Inlet. Our findings have two key consequences. First, given current reductions in sea ice and increases in Arctic killer whale sightings, killer whales have the potential to reshape Arctic marine mammal distributions and behavior. Second and of more general importance, predators have the potential to strongly affect movement behavior of tracked marine animals. Understanding predator effects may be as or more important than relating movement behavior to resource distribution or bottom-up drivers traditionally included in analyses of marine animal tracking data."
"Plague (caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis) is a deadly flea-borne disease that remains a threat to public health nearly worldwide and is particularly disruptive ecologically where it has been introduced. We review hypotheses regarding maintenance and transmission of Y. pestis, emphasizing recent data from North America supporting maintenance by persistent transmission that results in sustained non-epizootic (but variable) rates of mortality in hosts. This maintenance mechanism may facilitate periodic epizootic eruptions ""in place"" because the need for repeated reinvasion from disjunct sources is eliminated. Resulting explosive outbreaks that spread rapidly in time and space are likely enhanced by synergistic positive feedback (PFB) cycles involving flea vectors, hosts, and the plague bacterium itself. Although PFB has been implied in plague literature for at least 50 years, we propose this mechanism, particularly with regard to flea responses, as central to epizootic plague rather than a phenomenon worthy of just peripheral mention. We also present new data on increases in flea:host ratios resulting from recreational shooting and poisoning as possible triggers for the transition from enzootic maintenance to PFB cycles and epizootic explosions. Although plague outbreaks have received much historic attention, PFB cycles that result in decimation of host populations lead to speculation that epizootic eruptions might not be part of the adaptive evolutionary strategy of Y. pestis but might instead be a tolerated intermittent cost of its modus operandi. We also speculate that there may be mammal communities where epizootics, as we define them, are rare or absent. Absence of plague epizootics might translate into reduced public health risk but does not necessarily equate to inconsequential ecologic impact."
"Anxious youth are at heightened risk for subsequent development of depression; however, little is known regarding which anxious youth are at the highest prospective risk. Biased attentional patterns (e.g., vigilance and avoidance of negative cues) are implicated as key mechanisms in both anxiety and depression. Aberrant attentional patterns may disrupt opportunities to effectively engage with, and learn from, threatening aspects of the environment during development and/or treatment, compounding risk over time. Sixty-seven anxious youth (ages 9-14; 36 female) completed a dot-probe task to assess baseline attentional patterns provoked by fearful-neutral face pairs. The time course of attentional patterns both during and after threat was assessed via eye-tracking and pupilometry. Self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed 2 years after the conclusion of a larger psychotherapy treatment trial. Eye-tracking patterns indicating threat avoidance predicted greater 2-year depression scores, over and above baseline and posttreatment symptoms. Sustained, postthreat pupillary avoidance (reflecting preferential neural engagement with the neutral relative to the previously threatening location) predicted additional variance in depression scores, suggesting sustained avoidance in the wake of threat further exacerbated risk. Identical eye-tracking and pupil indices were not predictive of anxiety at 2 years. These biobehavioral markers imply that avoidant attentional processing in the context of anxiety may be a gateway to depression across a key maturational window. Excessive avoidance of threat could interfere with acquisition of adaptive emotion regulation skills during development, culminating in the broad behavioral deactivation that typifies depression. Prevention efforts explicitly targeting avoidant attentional patterns may be warranted."
"Antibiotic resistance remains a major global public health threat that requires sustained discovery of novel antibacterial agents with unexploited scaffolds. Structure-activity relationship of the first-generation aryl isonitrile compounds we synthesized led to an initial lead molecule that informed the synthesis of a second-generation of aryl isonitriles. From this new series of 20 compounds, three analogues inhibited growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (from 1 to 4microM) and were safe to human keratinocytes. Compound 19, with an additional isonitrile group exhibited improved activity against MRSA compared to the first-generation lead compound. This compound emerged as a candidate worthy of further investigation and further reinforced the importance of the isonitrile functionality in the compounds' anti-MRSA activity. In a murine skin wound model, 19 significantly reduced the burden of MRSA, similar to the antibiotic fusidic acid. In summary, 19 was identified as a new lead aryl isonitrile compound effective against MRSA."
"Neurologists are most likely to become involved in primarily diagnosing those bioterrorist attacks utilising botulinum toxin. Oral ingestion, or possibly inhalation, are likely routes of delivery. The characteristic descending paralysis starts in the extraocular and bulbar muscles, with associated autonomic features. Repetitive nerve stimulation usually shows an incremental muscle response. Treatment is supportive. The differential diagnosis is from naturally occurring paralysing illnesses such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenic crisis or diphtheria, from paralysing seafood neurotoxins (tetrodotoxin, saxitoxin), snake envenomation, and from chemical warfare poisoning by organophosphates. Primary neurological infections are less feasible for use as bioweapons. There are theoretical possibilities of Venezuelan equine encephalitis transmission by inhalation and secondary zoonotic transmission cycles sustained by horses and mosquitoes. Severe haemorrhagic meningitis regularly occurs in anthrax, usually in the aftermath of severe systemic disease likely to have been transmitted by spore inhalation. Panic and psychologically determined 'me-too' symptomatology are likely to pose the biggest diagnostic and management burden on neurologists handling bioterrorist attack on an institution or a random civilian population. Indeed civilian panic and disablement of institutional operations are likely to be prominent intentions of any bioterrorist attack."
"Polyomavirus nephropathy, also termed BK-virus nephropathy (BKN) after the main causative agent, the polyoma-BK-virus strain, is a significant complication after kidney transplantation. BKN is the most common viral infection that affects renal allografts with a prevalence of 1-9% on average 8-13 months post surgery. It can also occur sporadically in native kidneys. Viral nephropathy is caused by the (re)activation of latent BK viruses that enter into a replicative cycle under sustained and intensive immunosuppression. Pure productive kidney infections with JC- and SV-40 polyomaviruses are exceptionally rare. BKN is morphologically defined by the presence of intranuclear viral inclusion bodies in epithelial cells and tubular injury, which is the morphological correlate for renal dysfunction. Renal disease can progress through different histologic stages (from early BKN stage A to late fibrotic stage C) that carry prognostic significance; disease stages B and C often result in chronic kidney (allograft) dysfunction and end-stage renal disease. The clinical goal is to diagnose viral nephropathy in disease stage A and to limit chronic renal injury. Strategies to recognize, classify, and manage BKN are critically discussed including ancillary techniques for risk assessment and patient monitoring: (i) urine cytology and the search for so-called 'decoy cells'; (ii) PCR analyses for viral load measurements in the plasma and urine; and (iii) negative staining urine electron microscopy to identify viral particles."
"BACKGROUND: Although limited, the literature suggests alterations in activation of cognitive control regions in adults and adolescents with a history of childhood abuse. The current study examined whether such alterations are increased in the face of emotionally-distracting as compared to emotionally neutral information, and whether such alterations occur in brain regions that exert cognitive control in a more top-down sustained manner or a more bottom-up transient manner. METHODS: Participants were young adult women (ages 23-30): one group with a history of childhood physical or sexual abuse (N = 15) and one with no trauma exposure (N = 17), as assessed through the Trauma History Questionnaire and a two-stage interview adapted from the National Crime Victims Survey. Participants underwent fMRI scanning while completing hybrid block/event-related versions of a classic color-word and an emotional Stroop paradigm (threat and positive words). This paradigm allowed us to examine both sustained (activation persisting across blocks) and transient (event-specific activation) aspects of cognitive control. RESULTS: Women with a history of childhood abuse demonstrated decreased recruitment of frontal-parietal regions involved in cognitive control and enhanced recruitment of a ventral attention surveillance network during blocks of both versions of the Stroop task. Additionally, they had less suppression of brain regions involved in self-referential processes for threat blocks, but greater suppression of these regions for positive blocks. Severity of avoidance symptoms was associated with sustained activation in lateral prefrontal regions, whereas hyperarousal/re-experiencing symptoms were associated with sustained activity in temporal regions. No differential effects were observed for transient control. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest exposure to childhood abuse is associated with blunted recruitment of brain regions supporting task-set maintenance but hypervigilance for task-irrelevant information, regardless of whether distractors are emotionally neutral or emotional. Exposure to childhood abuse is also associated with less suppression of default mode brain regions associated with self-referential processing in the face of irrelevant threat information, but heightened ability to suppress similar processing for irrelevant positive information."
"Patients with inefficient CD4+ T-cell recovery on virogically suppressive highly active antiretroviral therapy constitute a major clinical hurdle given the threat of HIV/AIDS disease progression. We show heightened circulating lipopolysaccharide associated with plasma enterobacterial DNA and highly activated Ki67+CD4+CD8+ in 24 immunologic-nonresponders (CD4+ T-cell < or = 200; HIV-RNA < or = 50) compared with 11 full responders (CD4+ T-cell > or= 400; HIV-RNA < or = 50). These data provide novel insight into INRs pathogenesis, since they correlate augmented systemic translocation of microbial bioproducts with T-cell hyperactivation."
"This study reviewed the impacts of wastewater on macroinvertebrates over four decades in a UK lowland river. This involved examining changes in chemicals, temperature, flow and macroinvertebrate diversity from the 1970s until 2017 for a wastewater-dominated river downstream of Swindon in the UK (population about 220,000). When the wastewater treatment process changed from trickling filter to activated sludge in 1991, biological oxygen demand was nearly halved (90%ile 8.1 to 4.6 mg/L), ammonia peaks dropped more than 7-fold (90%ile 3.9 to 0.53 mg/L) whilst dissolved oxygen climbed consistently above 60% saturation (10%ile went from 49% to 64%) at a sampling point 2 km downstream of the wastewater treatment plant. A sustained increase in the number of macroinvertebrate species was evident from that point. River flow did not change, temperature rose slightly, whilst the major metal concentrations declined steadily over most of the monitoring period. Neither the introduction of phosphate stripping in 1999, nor the use of tertiary granular activated charcoal from 2008 to 2014 had strong positive effects on subsequent macroinvertebrate diversity. That the diversity still had not reached the ideal status by 2016 may be related to the modest habitat quality, agricultural pesticides and the limited recolonization potential in the catchment. The results indicate that urban wastewaters, with their chemical pollutants, are today probably not the biggest threat to the macroinvertebrate diversity of multiple-stressed lowland rivers in the UK.

"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are the most potent toxins known to man and a significant threat as weapons of bioterrorism. BoNTs contain a metalloprotease domain that blocks neurotransmitter release in nerve terminals, resulting in a descending, flaccid paralysis with a 5-10% mortality rate. Existing treatment options cannot access or neutralize the toxin following its endocytosis, so there is a clear need to develop novel therapies. Numerous substrate-based and zinc-chelating small-molecule inhibitors have been reported; however, none have progressed to the clinic. This is likely due to the difficulty that reversible inhibitors have in achieving sustained inhibition of the toxin, which has a half-life of months in vivo. An alternative strategy for mitigating BoNT persistence is covalent, irreversible inhibition of toxin function. However, few examples of covalent BoNT inhibitors have been reported. Here, we describe a competition-based screen to identify covalent modifiers of the conserved active-site-adjacent cysteine C165 in the BoNT/A serotype. We found that compounds containing cysteine-reactive electrophiles designed to target cysteine proteases failed to bind C165 while selenide compounds were efficient covalent binders of this cysteine. Importantly, covalent modification at C165 resulted in sustained, irreversible inhibition of BoNT/A protease activity. Covalent selenide inhibitors were nontoxic and protective in a neuronal assay of intoxication, making them promising new scaffolds for the study of the BoNT/A toxin as well as for the design of novel therapy agents."
"Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may exhibit chronic autonomic nervous system (ANS) hyperarousal (e.g., lower respiratory sinus arrhythmia and higher heart rate) compared to their typically developing peers, reflecting a chronic biological threat response. The sustained nature of this cardiac threat suggests tonic nervous system perception of threat in safe contexts. Herein, the cardiac literature in adult and child populations with ASD is reviewed and placed within a continuum of functioning in order to inform the relationship between cardiac response and functioning in ASD. Findings from this review support the relationship between chronic autonomic hyperarousal and emotional and behavioral difficulties observed in individuals with ASD."
"Videotaped recordings of adult lobsters of different molt stages were analyzed. The escape response of adults was compared with that of juveniles recorded in an earlier study. Juvenile lobsters always respond to a threat with escape behavior irrespective of their molt stage, but in adults the probability of eliciting a response was a function of molt stage: more hard-shelled (intermolt stage C) and (premolt stage D) animals tailflipped than did soft-shelled (postmolt stages A and B) animals. The number, frequency, and duration of tailflips, and the average distance swum by animals in each molt stage were measured for the entire escape response, for the initial power swim, and for the subsequent swims. These measurements were used to compute several parameters: velocity, acceleration, force, and work; average distance traveled in a tailflip for each kilogram of body weight (distance/kg/tailflip); and average distance traveled for each bodylength (distance/bodylength). Among adults, intermolt (stage C) lobsters traveled significantly farther and faster than postmolt animals (stages A and B). Among juveniles, late postmolt (stage B) animals traveled farther. Among adults, although the total number of tailflips and the duration of the response were not significantly different among molt stages, the number of tailflips/second (frequency) and distance traveled/kg/tailflip were greater for intermolt animals. In juvenile intermolts, however, frequency and distance/kg/tailflip were markedly lower than in the premolt stages. Although values were lower than intermolts and premolts, postmolt adults sustained their swimming frequency, distance/kg/tailflip, and distance/bodylength for the entire escape distance (as did postmolt juveniles). These parameters then dropped off sharply for both adult and juvenile intermolt and premolt animals in the second half of the escape distance. Post-threat behaviors reveal that stage D animals have the highest aggression index and often attack the presented stimulus, whereas stage A animals are the least likely to approach the stimulus and typically back away in a non-aggressive posture. Thus, although effects of the molt cycle on adult and juvenile escape behavior are similar in some ways, other physical characteristics of adults, such as weight, allometry, and physiology, seem to become important in determining the likelihood of escape behavior and the characteristics of the escape swim in each molt stage."
"The study aimed at investigating the immediate cardiac effect of the sudden perception of other people's laughter after experimentally manipulating healthy participants' proneness to experience laughter as a cue of social threat. We expected that participants would show cardiac signs of freezing (i.e., sustained heart rate deceleration immediately after perception of the laughter) after prior social rejection but not or less so after prior acceptance, due to an increased bias to perceive the ambiguous social signal as a cue of social threat and rejection after rejection had been primed. Contrary to expectations, the perception of other people's laughter elicited a decelerative (freezing) response regardless of whether it was preceded by the experience of social rejection or acceptance. The response was prolonged in participants who had been accepted beforehand compared to those who had been rejected. The findings indicate that, given a relevant social context, other people's laughter can be a powerful cue of social threat and rejection also in healthy individuals. Prolonged heart rate deceleration after an ambiguous social signal may facilitate the processing of significant social information in the socially threatening situation. The study adds to the literature rendering the course of the immediate transient heart rate response a useful tool in social rejection research. Additionally, the findings suggested that in some cases the further progress of transient heart rate changes in more extended time-windows (about 30s) may provide additional relevant information about the processing of social cues."
"Macular disease currently poses the greatest threat to vision in aging populations. Historically, most of this pathology could only be dealt with surgically, and then only after much damage to the macula had already occurred. Current pathophysiological insights into macular diseases have allowed the development of effective new pharmacotherapies. The field of drug delivery systems has advanced over the last several years with emphasis placed on controlled release of drug to specific areas of the eye. Its unique location and tendency toward chronic disease make the macula an important and attractive target for drug delivery systems, especially sustained-release systems. This review evaluates the current literature on the research and development of sustained-release posterior segment drug delivery systems that are primarily intended for macular disease with an emphasis on age-related macular degeneration.Current effective therapies include corticosteroids and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor compounds. Recent successes have been reported using anti-angiogenic drugs for therapy of age-related macular degeneration. This review also includes information on implantable devices (biodegradable and non-biodegradable), the use of injected particles (microspheres and liposomes) and future enhanced drug delivery systems, such as ultrasound drug delivery. The devices reviewed show significant drug release over a period of days or weeks. However, macular disorders are chronic diseases requiring years of treatment. Currently, there is no 'gold standard' for therapy and/or drug delivery. Future studies will focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of drug delivery to the posterior chamber. If successful, therapeutic modalities will significantly delay loss of vision and improve the quality of life for patients with chronic macular disorders."
"BACKGROUND: Medication discrepancies, which are a threat to patient safety, can be reduced by medication reconciliation (MedRec). MedRec is a complex process that can be supported by the use of information technology and patient engagement. Therefore, the SEAMPAT project aims to develop a MedRec IT platform based on two applications. The application for the professionals is called: the ""MedRec app"". OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we aimed to describe the development and usability testing of the MedRec app, reporting results of a three iterations user-centered usability evaluation. METHODS: We used a three phase iterative user-centered study spread over 16 months. At each phase, the usability evaluation included several methods (observations, questionnaires, and follow-up discussions with participants) to collect quantitative and qualitative data in order to improve the current prototype and evolve to the next prototype. RESULTS: In total, 48 healthcare professionals (25 general practitioners and 23 hospital clinicians) participated to the MedRec app evaluation. There were 14, 32 and 5 participants for phases 1, 2 and 3 respectively. At each phase, many design modifications were done to strengthen usability. Concerning usability, participants considered the prototypes as an acceptable interface with a median System Usability Score of 73 at phase 2 and 75 at phase 3. Participants emphasized the need for improvements concerning workflow integration, usefulness and interoperability. CONCLUSION: The MedRec app was perceived as being useful, usable and satisfying. However, further improvements are required in several usability aspects. Our study demonstrates the importance of conducting usability assessments before investing time and resources in a large study evaluating the effect of an eMedRec approach on clinical outcomes. Our findings may also increase the chances of acceptability and sustained use over time by clinicians."
"BACKGROUND: Exaggerated anticipatory anxiety is common in social anxiety disorder (SAD). Neuroimaging studies have revealed altered neural activity in response to social stimuli in SAD, but fewer studies have examined neural activity during anticipation of feared social stimuli in SAD. The current study examined the time course and magnitude of activity in threat processing brain regions during speech anticipation in socially anxious individuals and healthy controls (HC). METHOD: Participants (SAD n=58; HC n=16) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during which they completed a 90s control anticipation task and 90s speech anticipation task. Repeated measures multi-level modeling analyses were used to examine group differences in time course activity during speech vs. control anticipation for regions of interest, including bilateral amygdala, insula, ventral striatum, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. RESULTS: The time course of amygdala activity was more prolonged and less variable throughout speech anticipation in SAD participants compared to HCs, whereas the overall magnitude of amygdala response did not differ between groups. Magnitude and time course of activity was largely similar between groups across other regions of interest. LIMITATIONS: Analyses were restricted to regions of interest and task order was the same across participants due to the nature of deception instructions. CONCLUSIONS: Sustained amygdala time course during anticipation may uniquely reflect heightened detection of threat or deficits in emotion regulation in socially anxious individuals. Findings highlight the importance of examining temporal dynamics of amygdala responding."
"Research on the neural response to errors has an important role in the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project, since it is likely to link psychopathology to the dysfunction of neural systems underlying basic behavioral functions, with the error-related negativity (ERN) appearing as a unit of measurement in three RDoC domains. A recent report builds on previous research by examining the ERN as a measure of the sustained threat construct and providing evidence that the ERN may reflect sensitivity more specifically to endogenous threat. Data from 515 adolescent females indicate that the ERN was enlarged primarily in older adolescents with self-reported checking behaviors, although it was blunted in adolescents with depressive symptoms regardless of age. Potential future studies for replicating and extending the research on the ERN and obsessive-compulsive (OC) behaviors are discussed, including studies that more fully characterize OC symptom dimensions, studies that integrate other measures of error-related brain activity and use computational modeling, studies that combine longitudinal, family, and molecular genetic measures, and interventional studies that specifically modulate error-related brain activity in individuals with OC behaviors."
"Military personnel returning from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan commonly experience mental health problems and efforts are underway to determine risk and protective factors associated with postdeployment mental health concerns. This study examined the contribution of trait neuroticism, predeployment life events, combat experience, perceptions of threat, and postdeployment social support on mental health symptoms at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months postdeployment. Two hundred seventy-one veterans completed self-report measures. Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that neuroticism predicted post-traumatic stress and depressive symptoms at all 3 time points; perceived threat predicted post-traumatic stress symptoms at time 1 and time 2 and depressive symptoms at time 2. Social support was a strong negative predictor of post-traumatic stress and depressive symptoms. Alcohol misuse was not significantly predicted by any of the variables. The present study highlights the role of perceived threat and trait neuroticism on postdeployment mental health symptoms and indicates social support is a robust protective factor. Efforts aimed at increasing sustained postdeployment social support may help defend against significant mental health problems among veterans."
"Background: The central nucleus of the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis are involved primarily in phasic and sustained aversive states. Although both structures have been implicated in pathological anxiety, few studies with a clinical population have specifically focused on them, partly because of their small size. Previous work in our group used high-resolution imaging to map the restingstate functional connectivity of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the central nucleus of the amygdala in healthy subjects at 7 T, confirming and extending structural findings in humans and animals, while providing additional insight into cortical connectivity that is potentially unique to humans. Methods: In the current follow-up study, we contrasted resting-state functional connectivity in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and central nucleus of the amygdala at 7 T between healthy volunteers (n = 30) and patients with generalized and/or social anxiety disorder (n = 30). Results: Results revealed significant voxel-level group differences. Compared with healthy volunteers, patients showed stronger resting-state functional connectivity between the central nucleus of the amygdala and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and superior temporal sulcus. They also showed weaker resting-state functional connectivity between the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and occipital cortex. Limitations: These findings depart from a previous report of resting-state functional connectivity in the central nucleus of the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis under sustained threat of shock in healthy volunteers. Conclusion: This study provides functional MRI proxies of the functional dissociation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and central nucleus of the amygdala, and suggests that resting-state functional connectivity of key structures in the processing of defensive responses do not recapitulate changes related to induced state anxiety. Future work needs to replicate and further probe the clinical significance of these findings."
"Melanoma has been a serious threat to the human health; however, effective therapeutic methods of this cancer are still limited. Combined local therapy is a crucial approach for achieving a superior anti-tumor efficacy. In this paper, a chemo-immunotherapy system of DOX, IL-2 and IFN-gamma based on poly(gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate) (PELG-PEG-PELG) hydrogel was developed for local treatment of melanoma xenograft. The drug release process of this system exhibited a short term of burst release (the first 3 days), followed by a long-term sustained release (the following 26 days). The hydrogel degraded completely within 3 weeks without obvious inflammatory responses in the subcutaneous layer of rats, showing a good biodegradability and biocompatibility. The DOX/IL-2/IFN-gamma co-loaded hydrogel also showed enhanced anti-tumor effect against B16F10 cells in vitro, through increasing the ratio of cell apoptosis and G2/S phage cycle arrest. Moreover, the combined strategy presented improved therapy efficacy against B16F10 melanoma xenograft without obvious systemic side effects in a nude mice model, which was likely related to both the enhanced tumor cell apoptosis and the increased proliferation of the CD3(+)/CD4(+) T-lymphocytes and CD3(+)/CD8(+) T-lymphocytes. Overall, the strategy of localized co-delivery of DOX/IL-2/IFN-gamma using the polypeptide hydrogel provided a promising approach for efficient melanoma therapy."
"Despite its relatively well-understood role as a reproductive and pro-social peptide, oxytocin (OT) tells a more convoluted story in terms of its modulation of fear and anxiety. This nuanced story has been obscured by a great deal of research into the therapeutic applications of exogenous OT, driving more than 400 ongoing clinical trials. Drawing from animal models and human studies, we review the complex evidence concerning OT's role in fear learning and anxiety, clarifying the existing confusion about modulation of fear versus anxiety. We discuss animal models and human studies demonstrating the prevailing role of OT in strengthening fear memory to a discrete signal or cue, which allows accurate and rapid threat detection that facilitates survival. We also review ostensibly contrasting behavioral studies that nonetheless provide compelling evidence of OT attenuating sustained contextual fear and anxiety-like behavior, arguing that these OT effects on the modulation of fear vs. anxiety are not mutually exclusive. To disambiguate how endogenous OT modulates fear and anxiety, an understudied area compared to exogenous OT, we survey behavioral studies utilizing OT receptor (OTR) antagonists. Based on emerging evidence about the role of OTR in rat dorsolateral bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) and elsewhere, we postulate that OT plays a critical role in facilitating accurate discrimination between stimuli representing threat and safety. Supported by human studies, we demonstrate that OT uniquely facilitates adaptive fear but reduces maladaptive anxiety. Last, we explore the limited literature on endogenous OT and its interaction with corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) with a special emphasis on the dorsolateral BNST, which may hold the key to the neurobiology of phasic fear and sustained anxiety."
"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Burn injuries are a serious threat to individuals with altered consciousness during epilepsy. The objective of this study detailing 33 individuals who sustained scalds or burn injuries during an epileptic seizure, was to clarify typical injury mechanisms, extent, therapy and sequelae of these injuries and thus identify potential preventive measures to protect this special population from thermal trauma. RESULTS: Overall, 16 women and 17 men with a mean age of 39.6 (range: 21 - 76) years were included in this retrospective review. The burned body area averaged 16 % (maximum: 51 %), 30 of the 33 patients (91 %) required burn wound excision and skin grafting. The mean ABSI score was 5.5 (range: 3 to 11) points. Thermal trauma mostly occurred as hot water scalds (n = 19) during showering or bathing in a tub (n = 15), followed by falls during cooking or into open fire. None of our patients was informed about the risk of experiencing severe thermal injuries during epileptic seizures. The length of intensive care averaged 33 days (maximum: 79 days), all patients survived. The estimated treatment costs were at least 50,000 Euros per patient. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, epileptic seizures can cause severe and deep thermal trauma. Our data shows that most of these injuries happen at home and may be easily prevented by simple safety devices, such as water thermo-regulators or the avoidance of high-risk situations, it seems advisable to inform patients with epilepsy and their families and care-givers of this specific danger."
"The link between the world drug problem and securitisation has been predominantly established to argue that an existential threat discourse reinforces the international prohibitionist regime and makes it harder for alternative policy models to arise. This analysis is problematic for three main reasons. Firstly, it overestimates the current strength of the international drug control regime as a normative and regulatory system that prescribes state behaviour. Secondly, the current international regime does not inhibit policy reforms. While the international treaty system proves resistant to change, it is at the national and local levels where new drug policies arise. Moreover, these are generally not the draconian or emergency measures that successful securitisation would predict. Thirdly, the analysis so far misinterprets criminalisation or militarisation as evidence of securitisation. As the case of Afghanistan shows, securitisation attempts, such as those linking the Taliban and the illicit opium economy, may have reinforced the militarisation of drug control in Afghanistan, but did not elevate the illicit drug economy as an external threat or a top priority. While there have been short-lived spikes of attention and provincial level campaigns to eradicate poppy cultivation, these have never translated into a sustained structural effort to combat illicit drugs in Afghanistan. Even the latest push for militarisation, the US-led campaign of airstrikes on drug processing laboratories since November 2017, represents more a shift in counter-insurgency strategy than successful securitisation. While Afghanistan's illicit drug economy has been politicised for several reasons, states are not convinced that this economy somehow represents an existential threat to their survival."
"Colonial organisms with division of labour are assumed to achieve increased colony-level efficiency in task performance through functional specialisation of individuals into distinct castes. In social insects, ratios of individuals in different castes can adjust adaptively in response to external threats. However, whether flexibility in caste ratio also occurs in other social organisms with division of labour remains unclear. Some parasitic trematodes, in which clonal colonies within the snail intermediate host comprise a reproductive caste and a soldier caste, offer good systems to test the general nature of adaptive caste ratio adjustments. Using the trematode Philophthalmus sp. as model, we test whether trematode colonies shift their composition towards more soldiers when exposed to a sustained risk of invasion by a competitor parasite species, and/or when experiencing sustained, active competition. We also quantify the colony-level fitness impact of caste ratio adjustments, measured as the colony's output of larval infective stages. We conducted two long-term laboratory experiments on within-snail trematode colonies. First, snails harbouring Philophthalmus colonies were exposed to different levels of invasion risk by another trematode species, Maritrema novaezealandense. Second, the structure of Philophthalmus colonies was quantified after a year-long period of within-snail competition with the other trematode species. When facing the risk of invasion by a competitor, independently of the level of risk, Philophthalmus colonies showed a significant shift towards producing more soldiers, resulting in altered caste ratio. Similarly, when experiencing actual competition by another trematode established in the same snail, Philophthalmus colonies also adjusted by producing significantly more soldiers. Greater investments in defense via more soldiers had negative impacts on the establishment and size of the competitor's colonies. Nevertheless, the presence of the competitor reduced the fitness (output of infective stages) of Philophthalmus colonies, although the production of more soldiers mitigated that effect. Our findings demonstrate that trematode colonies with division of labour are capable of adaptive caste ratio adjustments in response to both the perceived threat of competition and actual competition, with trade-offs against reproductive success only apparent when soldier numbers are very high. Combined with results on social insects, our study suggests parallel adaptations of colonial organisms in phylogenetically disparate organisms."
"BACKGROUND: The startle reflex is potentiated by aversive states. It has been proposed that phasic startle potentiation to a threat cue and sustained startle potentiation to contextual stimuli reflect distinct processes mediated by different brain structures. The present study tested the hypothesis that alprazolam would reduce the sustained startle potentiation to contextual threats but not the startle potentiation to a threat cue. METHODS: Sixteen healthy subjects received each of four treatments: placebo, .5 mg of alprazolam, 1 mg of alprazolam, and 50 mg of diphenhydramine (Benadryl) in a crossover design. Participants were exposed to three conditions, including one in which predictable aversive shocks were signaled by a cue, a second in which shocks were administered unpredictably, and a third condition in which no shocks were anticipated. Acoustic startle were delivered regularly across conditions. RESULTS: Phasic startle potentiation to the threat cue in the predictable condition was not affected by alprazolam. In contrast, the sustained increase in startle in the predictable and unpredictable conditions was reduced significantly by the high dose of alprazolam. CONCLUSIONS: Startle responses to an explicit threat cue and to an aversive context are psychopharmacologically distinct, suggesting that they may represent functionally dissociable aversive states."
"The beneficial effects of placebo treatments on fear and anxiety (placebo anxiolysis) are well known from clinical practice, and there is strong evidence indicating a contribution of treatment expectations to the efficacy of anxiolytic drugs. Although clinically highly relevant, the neural mechanisms underlying placebo anxiolysis are poorly understood. In two studies in humans, we tested whether the administration of an inactive treatment along with verbal suggestions of anxiolysis can attenuate experimentally induced states of phasic fear and/or sustained anxiety. Phasic fear is the response to a well defined threat and includes attentional focusing on the source of threat and concomitant phasic increases of autonomic arousal, whereas in sustained states of anxiety potential and unclear danger requires vigilant scanning of the environment and elevated tonic arousal levels. Our placebo manipulation consistently reduced vigilance measured in terms of undifferentiated reactivity to salient cues (indexed by subjective ratings, skin conductance responses and EEG event-related potentials) and tonic arousal [indexed by cue-unrelated skin conductance levels and enhanced EEG alpha (8-12 Hz) activity], indicating a downregulation of sustained anxiety rather than phasic fear. We also observed a placebo-dependent sustained increase of frontal midline EEG theta (4-7 Hz) power and frontoposterior theta coupling, suggesting the recruitment of frontally based cognitive control functions. Our results thus support the crucial role of treatment expectations in placebo anxiolysis and provide insight into the underlying neural mechanisms."
"INTRODUCTION: Physician health programs (PHPs) generate high rates of sustained abstinence in addicted physicians, through a combination of formal treatment, self-help involvement, regular monitoring via random urine toxicology tests, and powerful incentives generated by the threat of losing one's medical license. Recently, Caron Treatment Centers developed a new continuing care intervention, ""My First Year of Recovery"" (MyFYR), which is modeled after PHPs but provides extended recovery support to a broader segment of those with substance use disorders. This paper presents initial outcome data from MyFYR. METHODS: MyFYR features frequent outcomes monitoring via urine toxicology tests, and also includes a web-based social platform to coordinate efforts of recovery coaches, family members, and others (e.g., employers, probation officers). Participants were the first 198 clients who enrolled in MyFYR after participating in residential treatment at Caron. Substance use outcomes were determined by a combination of urine toxicology tests, client self-report, and information from family members obtained during a 12-month period following entry into MyFYR. RESULTS: Clients in MyFYR provided 70% of scheduled urine samples, for an average of 16.4 urine samples per client. Only 4.1% of the samples tested positive for alcohol or any drug. As determined by urine toxicology and client and family reports, 54% of the participants had some use of alcohol or drugs during the follow-up. Of these relapsed clients, 70.1% were retained or re-engaged in MyFYR, and of these, half were able to re-establish abstinence of two months duration or more, as documented by urine toxicology. DISCUSSION: These initial results are extremely promising, as they document high rates of sustained participation in urine drug test monitoring and positive outcome in clients not under the threat of losing a professional license or incarceration."
"Psychological stress and glucocorticoids are associated with heightened cardiovascular disease risk. We investigated whether stress or cortisol would be associated with reduced circulating angiogenic cell (CAC) function, an index of impaired vascular repair. We hypothesized that minority-race individuals who experience threat in interracial interactions would exhibit reduced CAC function, and that this link might be explained by cortisol. To test this experimentally, we recruited 106 African American participants for a laboratory interracial interaction task, in which they received socially evaluative feedback from Caucasian confederates. On a separate day, a subset of 32 participants (mean age=26years, 47% female) enrolled in a separate biological substudy and provided blood samples for CAC isolation and salivary samples to quantify the morning peak in cortisol (the cortisol awakening response, CAR). CAC function was quantified using cell culture assays of migration to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and secretion of VEGF into the culture medium. Heightened threat in response to an interracial interaction and trait anxiety in vivo were both associated with poorer CAC migratory function in vitro. Further, threat and poorer sustained attention during the interracial interaction were associated with a higher CAR, which in turn, was related to lower CAC sensitivity to glucocorticoids. In vitro, higher doses of cortisol impaired CAC migratory function and VEGF protein secretion. The glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 reversed this functional impairment. These data identify a novel, neuroendocrine pathway by which psychological stress may reduce CAC function, with potential implications for cardiovascular health."
"Childhood maltreatment increases lifetime vulnerability for psychopathology. One proposed mechanism for this association is that early maltreatment increases vigilance for and attention to subtle threat cues, persisting outside of the environment in which maltreatment occurs. To test this possibility, the present study examined neural responses to ambiguous and nonambiguous threatening facial expressions in a sample of 25 adults reporting a history of low-to-moderate levels of abuse in childhood and 46 reporting no or low levels of childhood maltreatment. The measure of neural response used was the late positive potential (LPP), a neural marker of sustained attention to motivationally salient information that is sensitive to subtle variation in emotional content. Participants passively viewed angry-neutral and fearful-neutral face blends and rated emotional intensity for each face. In the maltreated group, as fearful faces increased in emotional intensity, the LPP similarly increased, suggesting increased sensitivity to subtle variation in threatening content. Moreover, the LPP at each level of emotional intensity was not related to current symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, contrary to our hypotheses, adults with a history of abuse did not rate angry or fearful faces as more threatening, nor did they exhibit a larger LPP to angry faces, compared to controls. These findings suggest that childhood maltreatment may be associated with increased sensitivity to ambiguous threatening information in adulthood."
"Recent data suggests that several psychopathological conditions are associated with alterations in the variability of behavioral and physiological responses. Pathological worry, defined as the cognitive representation of a potential threat, has been associated with reduced variability of heart beat oscillations (i.e., decreased heart rate variability; HRV) and lapses of attention indexed by reaction times (RTs). Clinical populations with attention deficit show RTs oscillation around 0.05 and 0.01 Hz when performing a sustained attention task. We tested the hypothesis that people who are prone to worry do it in a predictable oscillating pattern revealed through recurrent lapses in attention and concomitant oscillating HRV. Sixty healthy young adults (50% women) were recruited: 30 exceeded the clinical cut-off on the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; High-Worry, HW); the remaining 30 constituted the Low-Worry (LW) group. After a diagnostic assessment, participants performed two 15-min sustained attention tasks, interspersed by a standardized worry-induction procedure. RTs, HRV and moods were assessed. The analyses of the frequency spectrum showed that the HW group presents a significant higher and constant peak of RTs oscillation around 0.01 Hz (period 100 s) after the induction of worry, in comparison with their baseline and with the LW group that was not responsive to the induction procedure. Physiologically, the induction significantly reduced high-frequency HRV and such reduction was associated with levels of self-reported worry. Results are coherent with the oscillatory nature of the default mode network (DMN) and further confirm an association between cognitive rigidity and autonomic nervous system inflexibility."
"OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present study is twofold: (1) demonstrate the importance of measuring and understanding the relationship between task engagement and vigilance performance, and (2) celebrate the work of Joel S. Warm and expand upon his previous research in two semantic vigilance paradigms. BACKGROUND: The importance of measuring task engagement in cognitive and sensory vigilance tasks has been well documented. But to date, our understanding of the effects of task engagement on semantic vigilance performance is limited. METHOD: Seventy-three participants completed either a standard semantic vigilance task or a lure semantic vigilance task. Participants also completed subjective measures of workload and stress. RESULTS: The results indicated that changes in task engagement are associated with correct detection performance. Changes in task engagement may be related to individual differences in the distress associated with performing semantic vigilance tasks. CONCLUSION: In line with the work of Warm and his colleagues (Dember, Warm, Bowers, & Lanzetta, 1984), participants who reported increased task engagement after the vigil outperformed their peers who noted decreased task engagement upon conclusion of the task. Participants reporting increases in engagement with the semantic vigilance tasks also reported significantly greater distress pretask, but not posttask. Instead, increases in postvigil distress were driven by the task to which participants were assigned, not task engagement. APPLICATION: The present study has several implications for applied settings that involve long duration semantic processing or semantic target identification. Such real-world tasks include aviation, cyber threat detection and analysis, driving, and reading."
"The synthesis of a fully degradable, bio-based, sustained release, pro-antimicrobial polymer network comprised of degradable acetals (PANDA) is reported. The active antimicrobial agent - p-anisaldehyde (pA) (an extract from star anise) - was converted into a UV curable acetal containing pro-antimicrobial monomer and subsequently photopolymerized into a homogenous thiol-ene network. Under neutral to acidic conditions (pH<8), the PANDAs undergo surface erosion and exhibit sustained release of pA over 38days. The release of pA from PANDAs was shown to be effective against both bacterial and fungal pathogens. From a combination of confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, we observed that the released pA disrupts the cell membrane. Additionally, we demonstrated that PANDAs have minimal cytotoxicity towards both epithelial cells and macrophages. Although a model platform, these results point to promising pathways for the design of fully degradable sustained-release antimicrobial systems with potential applications in agriculture, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, household/personal care, and food industries. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: With the increasing number of patients prescribed immunosuppressants coupled with the rise in antibiotic resistance - life-threatening microbial infections are a looming global threat. With limited success within the antibiotic pipeline, nature-based essential oils (EOs) are being investigated for their multimodal effectiveness against microbes. Despite the promising potential of EOs, difficulties in their encapsulation, limited water solubility, and high volatility limit their use. Various studies have shown that covalent attachment of these EO derivatives to polymers can mitigate these limitations. The current study presents the synthesis of a fully-degradable, sustained release, cytocompatible, pro-antimicrobial acetal network derived from p-anisaldehyde. This polymer network design provides a pathway toward application-specific EO releasing materials with quantitative encapsulation efficiencies, sustained release, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity."
"BACKGROUND: Endoscopy is useful in assessing conduit ischemia and anastomotic leaks after esophagectomy but poses a theoretical threat of anastomotic disruption. We used a porcine model to evaluate the safety of endoscopy after esophagectomy. METHODS: We performed esophagectomies in 10 live pigs and performed endoscopy with progressive air insufflation and continuous intraluminal pressure monitoring. We stopped insufflation when the intraluminal pressure reached a plateau. We assessed the integrity of the conduit and anastomosis via endoscopy. We also performed pulse oximetry of the stomach and Doppler velocimetry of the right gastroepiploic artery on 5 live pigs to study the effects of endoscopic gastric insufflation. RESULTS: With gentle air insufflation, there was no measurable increase in intraluminal pressure, disruption of the conduit or anastomosis, or significant gastric distension. With progressive insufflation, the intraluminal pressure reached a plateau at a maximum of 8.7 +/- 2.1 cm H2O (95% confidence interval, 7.2-10.2). At this plateau, air leaked retrograde via the mouth, which prevented further gastric distension. There were no significant changes in oxyhemoglobin saturation along various regions in the stomach even with maximal insufflation sustained for 10 minutes. There was a momentary reduction in gastroepiploic flow from 12.0 +/- 1.0 [95% confidence interval, 10.8-13.2] mL/min/100 g to 9.6 +/- 1.5 [95% confidence interval, 7.8-11.4] mL/min/100 g immediately after maximal insufflation, but flow recovered to 11 +/- 1.3 [9.6, 12.8] mL/min/100 g after 10 minutes of sustained insufflation. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopy after esophagectomy with gentle or maximal air insufflation results in safe endoluminal pressures and minimal disturbance of blood flow and oxygenation."
"Sex differences in emotional reactivity have been studied primarily for negative but less so for positive stimuli; likewise, sex differences in the psychophysiological response-patterning during such stimuli are poorly understood. Thus, the present study examined sex differences in response to negative/positive and high/low arousing films (classified as threat-, loss-, achievement-, and recreation-related, vs. neutral films), while measuring 18 muscular, autonomic, and respiratory parameters. Sex differences emerged for all films, but were most prominent for threat-related films: Despite equivalent valence and arousal ratings, women displayed more facial-muscular and respiratory responding than men and pronounced sympathetic activation (preejection period, other cardiovascular and electrodermal measures), while men showed coactivated sympathetic/parasympathetic responding (including increased respiratory sinus arrhythmia). This indicates a prototypical threat-related defense response in women, while men showed a pattern of sustained orienting, which can be understood as a shift toward less threat proximity in the defense cascade model. Clinical implications are discussed within a socio-evolutionary framework."
"Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) models implicate social threat cue vigilance (i.e., attentional biases) in symptom development and maintenance. A modified dot-probe protocol has been shown to reduce SAD symptoms, in some but not all studies, presumably by modifying an attentional bias. The current randomized controlled trial was designed to replicate and extend such research. Participants included treatment-seeking adults (n = 108; 58% women) who met diagnostic criteria for SAD. Participants were randomly assigned to a standard (i.e., control) or modified (i.e., active) dot-probe protocol condition and to participate in-lab or at home. The protocol involved twice-weekly 15-min sessions, for 4 weeks, with questionnaires completed at baseline, post-treatment, 4-month follow-up, and 8-month follow-up. Symptom reports were assessed with repeated measures mixed hierarchical modeling. There was a main effect of time from baseline to post-treatment wherein social anxiety symptoms declined significantly (p < .05) but depression and trait anxiety did not (p > .05). There were no significant interactions based on condition or participation location (ps > .05). Reductions were maintained at 8-month follow-up. Symptom reductions were not correlated with threat biases as indexed by the dot-probe task. The modified and standard protocol both produced significant sustained symptom reductions, whether administered in-lab or at home. There were no robust differences based on protocol type. As such, the mechanisms for benefits associated with modified dot-probe protocols warrant additional research."
"Viral hepatitis is a major public health threat and a leading cause of death worldwide. Annual mortality from viral hepatitis is similar to that of other major infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. Highly effective prevention measures and treatments have made the global elimination of viral hepatitis a realistic goal, endorsed by all WHO member states. Ambitious targets call for a global reduction in hepatitis-related mortality of 65% and a 90% reduction in new infections by 2030. This Commission draws together a wide range of expertise to appraise the current global situation and to identify priorities globally, regionally, and nationally needed to accelerate progress. We identify 20 heavily burdened countries that account for over 75% of the global burden of viral hepatitis. Key recommendations include a greater focus on national progress towards elimination with support given, if necessary, through innovative financing measures to ensure elimination programmes are fully funded by 2020. In addition to further measures to improve access to vaccination and treatment, greater attention needs to be paid to access to affordable, high-quality diagnostics if testing is to reach the levels needed to achieve elimination goals. Simplified, decentralised models of care removing requirements for specialised prescribing will be required to reach those in need, together with sustained efforts to tackle stigma and discrimination. We identify key examples of the progress that has already been made in many countries throughout the world, demonstrating that sustained and coordinated efforts can be successful in achieving the WHO elimination goals."
"BACKGROUND: Generalized social anxiety disorder (gSAD) is associated with a heightened neural sensitivity to signals that convey threat, as evidenced by exaggerated amygdala and/or insula activation when processing face stimuli that express negative emotions. Less clear in the brain pathophysiology of gSAD are cortical top down control mechanisms that moderate reactivity in these subcortical emotion processing regions. This study evaluated amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity in gSAD with a novel ""Emotional Faces Shifting Attention Task"" (EFSAT), an adaptation of perceptual assessment tasks well-known to elicit amygdala response. In healthy volunteers, the task has been shown to engage the amygdala when attention is directed to emotional faces and the ACC when attention is directed to shapes, away from emotional faces. METHODS: During functional MRI, 29 participants with gSAD and 27 healthy controls viewed images comprising a trio of faces (angry, fear, or happy) alongside a trio of geometric shapes (circles, rectangles, or triangles) within the same field of view. Participants were instructed to match faces or match shapes, effectively directing attention towards or away from emotional information, respectively. RESULTS: Participants with gSAD exhibited greater insula, but not amygdala, activation compared to controls when attending to emotional faces. In contrast, when attention was directed away from faces, controls exhibited ACC recruitment, which was not evident in gSAD. Across participants, greater ACC activation was associated with less insula activation. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence that individuals with gSAD exhibited exaggerated insula reactivity when attending to emotional faces in EFSAT is consistent with other studies suggesting that the neural basis of gSAD may involve insula hyper-reactivity. Furthermore, greater ACC response in controls than gSAD when sustained goal-directed attention is required to shift attention away from social signals, together with a negative relationship between ACC and bilateral insula activity, indicate the ACC may have served a regulatory role when the focus of attention was directed to shapes amidst emotional faces."
"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) signifies an important health issue as it is a globally prevalent pathogen and poses a great threat to human health. Direct antiviral therapy became a landmark in treatment against chronic HCV infection as they have proven to increase sustained virological response (SVR) rate, provide shortened and simplified regimens. This study aimed to evaluate efficacy of Sofosbuvir and classify factors of treatment success and their function in therapy continuation decision. We studied host and viral factors in 310 patients who received Sofosbuvir (DAA) at a dose of 400 mg daily along with ribavirin 10 mg/kg body weight for 24 weeks and followed by 12 weeks after completion of treatment. A total of 302 patients (97.42%) showed end-of-treatment response. However, 8 patients (2.58%) were virological nonresponders and 286 patients (94.70%) achieved SVR. Among 310 HCV positive, the percentage of viral genotype 3-infected patients was 89.6%, whereas only 10.32% were affected by HCV genotype 1. Multivariable analysis showed that baseline HCV RNA (</=8 x 10(6) IU/mL vs. >8 x 10(6) IU/mL) [95% confidence interval (CI), odds ratio (OR) 3.0, 2.0 to 8.4; p = 0.004], age (<50 vs. >/=50 years) (95% CI, OR 1.9, 3.0 to 10.1; p = 0.03), liver texture (normal liver vs. coarse) are related to virological response. None of the patients included in the study has S282T substitution in NS5b of HCV. No significant difference in response was observed in patients with different genotypes of rs12979860. Liver texture, age, and viral load are predictors of SVR. In this real-life data no substitution of S282T in NS5b was observed related to failure of therapy. Oral Sofosbuvir generally has a high tolerance and can effortlessly beat the safety concerns of past regimens."
"The use of nanotechnology could play a significant role in the agriculture sector, especially in the preparation of new-generation agronanochemicals. Currently, the economically important plant of Malaysia, the oil palm, faces the threat of a devastating disease which is particularly caused by a pathogenic fungus, Ganoderma boninense. For the development of an effective antifungal agent, a series of chitosan nanoparticles loaded with a fumigant, dazomet, were prepared using various concentrations of sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP)-2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg/mL, abbreviated as CDEN2.5, CDEN5, CDEN10, and CDEN20, respectively. The effect of TPP as a crosslinking agent on the resulting particle size of the synthesized nanoparticles was investigated using a particle size analyzer and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Both methods confirmed that increasing the TPP concentration resulted in smaller particles. In addition, in vitro fumigant release at pH 5.5 showed that the release of the fumigant from the nanoparticles was of a sustained manner, with a prolonged release time up to 24 h. Furthermore, the relationship between the chitosan-dazomet nanoparticles and the in vitro antifungal activity against G. boninense was also explored, where the nanoparticles of the smallest size, CDEN20, gave the highest antifungal efficacy with the lowest half maximum effective concentration (EC50) value of 13.7 +/- 1.76 ppb. This indicates that the smaller-sized agronanoparticles were more effective as an antifungal agent. The size can be altered, which plays a crucial role in combatting the Ganoderma disease. The agronanoparticles have controlled release properties and high antifungal efficacy on G. boninense, thus making them a promising candidate to be applied in the field for Ganoderma treatment."
"Background & objectives: Submicroscopic malaria infections with low parasite density serve as a silent reservoir for maintaining residual transmission in the population. These infections should be identified and targeted to be eliminated for sustained malaria control. The conventional methods of diagnosis such as light microscopy and rapid diagnostic kits often fail to detect low density infections. Therefore, the more sensitive molecular techniques should be employed to detect low density infections. The objectives of the study was to explore the prevalence of sub-microscopic infections in low transmission areas of Punjab using highly sensitive molecular tool. Methods: A total of 1114 finger prick blood samples were collected through active surveillance and tested for malaria diagnosis using light microscopy, RDT and PCR. Nested PCR amplification was performed using a pair of Plasmodium genus-specific primers from the 18S rRNA small subunit gene (18S rRNA). The amplified PCR products were analysed using a 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and observed under transilluminator. Results: Test positive rate (TPR) by microscopy, RDT and PCR was 4.4, 3.95 and 5.75%, respectively. Microscopy and RDT failed to detect mixed infections whereas 0.26% cases were found to be mixed infection in PCR. Compared to LM and RDT, PCR has detected 1.3% additional positive cases. However, of the total positive cases detected by PCR, 23.4% infections were found to be submicroscopic, which could not be detected by conventional methods of diagnosis. Interpretation & conclusions: The molecular study revealed the existence of submicroscopic malaria cases in the study population which would have remained undetected by conventional methods of diagnosis. This is particularly important because Punjab state is in malaria elimination phase and targeted to achieve elimination in 2021. However, such undetected parasite positive cases may pose bigger problem any time due to continued transmission. Therefore, application of more sensitive diagnostic tools like PCR and LAMP with conventional methods may be much more useful in case detection particularly in low transmission settings for malaria elimination."
"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a threat to human health and can lead to amputation and even death. Recently neurotensin (NT), an inflammatory modulator in wound healing, was found to be beneficial for diabetic wound healing. As we demonstrated previously, polylactide-polyglycolide (PLGA) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) (PLGA/CNC) nanofiber membranes show good cytocompatibility and facilitate fibroblast adhesion, spreading and proliferation. PLGA/CNC nanofiber membranes are novel materials that have not been used previously as NT carriers in diabetic wounds. This study aims to explore the therapeutic efficacy and possible mechanisms of NT-loaded PLGA/CNC nanofiber membranes in full-thickness skin wounds in spontaneously diabetic mice. The results showed that NT could be sustained released from NT-loaded PLGA/CNC composite nanofiber membranes for 2 weeks. NT-loaded PLGA/CNC composite nanofiber membranes induced more rapid healing than other control groups. After NT exposure, the histological scores of the epidermal and dermal regeneration and the ratios of the fibrotic area to the whole area were increased. NT-loaded PLGA/CNC composite nanofiber membranes also decreased the expressions of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-6. These results suggest that NT-loaded PLGA/CNC composite nanofiber membranes for sustained delivery of NT should effectively promote tissue regeneration for the treatment of DFUs."
"Startle reflex studies in rodents indicate that female are more reactive than rats in experimental models of sustained anxiety but not in models of phasic fear (Toufexis, 2007). This study examined evidence for a similar effect in humans. Participants were exposed to three conditions, (1) predictable aversive shocks signaled by a cue, (2) unpredictable shocks, and (3) no shocks. Acoustic startle stimuli were delivered regularly across conditions. Phasic startle potential to the threat cue in the predictable condition was not affected by sex. In contrast, and consistent with basic research, the sustained increase in startle in the predictable and unpredictable conditions was greater in women compared to men. Animal studies suggest that such an effect may be mediated by the effects of sexual dimorphism in limbic structures, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. However, psychosocial factors may also contribute to this effect."
"The present study examined the interaction of anticipatory anxiety and selective emotion processing. Toward this end, a rapid stream of pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant pictures was presented in alternating blocks of threat-of-shock or safety, which were signaled by colored picture frames. The main finding is that pleasant pictures elicited a sustained negative difference potential over occipital regions during threat as compared to safety periods. In contrast, unpleasant and neutral picture processing did not vary as a function of threat-of-shock. Furthermore, in both the safety and threat-of-shock conditions, emotional pictures elicited an enlarged early posterior negativity and late positive potential. These data show that the activation of the fear/anxiety network exerts valence-specific effects on affective picture processing. Pleasant stimuli mismatching the current state of anticipatory anxiety apparently draw more attentional resources."
"Despite extensive engineering of tissue-contacting biomedical devices to control healing, these devices remain susceptible to bacterial colonization, biofilm formation, and chronic infection. The threat of selecting for resistance genes largely precludes sustained antimicrobial elution as a wide-spread clinical solution. In response, self-defensive surfaces have been developed where antimicrobial is released only when and where there is a bacterial challenge. We explore a new self-defensive approach using anionic microgels into which small-molecule cationic antimicrobials are loaded by complexation. We identify conditions where antimicrobial remains sequestered within the microgels for periods as long as weeks. However, bacterial contact triggers release and leads to local bacterial killing. We speculate that the close proximity of bacteria alters the local thermodynamic environment and interferes with the microgel-antimicrobial complexation. The contact-transfer approach does not require bacterial metabolism but instead appears to be driven by differences between the microgels and the bacterial cell envelope where there is a high concentration of negative charge and hydrophobicity. Contact with metabolizing macrophages or osteoblasts is, however, insufficient to trigger antimicrobial release, indicating that contact transfer can be specific to bacteria and suggesting an avenue to biomedical device surfaces that can simultaneously promote healing and resist infection."
"Surviving threats in the environment requires brain circuits for detecting (or anticipating) danger and for coordinating appropriate defensive responses (e.g., increased cardiac output, stress hormone release, and freezing behavior). The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a critical interface between the ""affective forebrain""-including the amygdala, ventral hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex-and the hypothalamic and brainstem areas that have been implicated in neuroendocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses to actual or anticipated threats. However, the precise contribution of the BNST to defensive behavior is unclear, both in terms of the antecedent stimuli that mobilize BNST activity and the consequent defensive reactions. For example, it is well known that the BNST is essential for contextual fear conditioning, but dispensable for fear conditioning to discrete conditioned stimuli (CSs), at least as indexed by freezing behavior. However, recent evidence suggests that there are circumstances in which contextual freezing may persist independent of the BNST. Furthermore, the BNST is involved in the reinstatement (or relapse) of conditioned freezing to extinguished discrete CSs. As such, there are critical gaps in understanding how the BNST contributes to fundamental processes involved in Pavlovian fear conditioning. Here, we attempt to provide an integrative account of BNST function in fear conditioning. We discuss distinctions between unconditioned stress and conditioned fear and the role of BNST circuits in organizing behaviors associated with these states. We propose that the BNST mediates conditioned defensive responses-not based on the modality or duration of the antecedent threat or the duration of the behavioral response to the threat-but rather as consequence the ability of an antecedent stimulus to predict when an aversive outcome will occur (i.e., its temporal predictability). We argue that the BNST is not uniquely mobilized by sustained threats or uniquely involved in organizing sustained fear responses. In contrast, we argue that the BNST is involved in organizing fear responses to stimuli that poorly predict when danger will occur, no matter the duration, modality, or complexity of those stimuli. The concepts discussed in this review are critical to understanding the contribution of the human BNST to fear and anxiety disorders."
"Individuals with clinical anxiety demonstrate an attention bias toward threatening information, which is thought to be partially driven by heightened amygdala activity to perceived threat. Attention Bias Modification (ABM) is a computer-based treatment that trains attention toward neutral stimuli and away from threatening stimuli. Alterations in initial processing of threat have been linked to ABM responses, but the impact of protracted processing in the aftermath of neutral and threatening information on ABM outcomes has not been well studied. Our study tested whether sustained activity in the amygdala, which occurred after neutral and threatening stimuli had been removed, could predict which individuals would respond well to ABM. Unmedicated anxious individuals underwent a baseline fMRI assessment during performance of a task sensitive to protracted emotional processing. Afterward, they were randomized to complete eight sessions of ABM (n = 38) or a sham training (n = 19). ABM patients who displayed greater sustained bilateral amygdalar response in the aftermath of neutral stimuli displayed the least improvement in self-reported (but not clinician-rated) vigilance symptoms. In contrast, amygdalar response did not predict improvement in sham patients. Results suggest that in certain anxious individuals, the amygdala may have a robust protracted response even to subjectively neutral cues, which could make these individuals a poor fit for ABM because of its focus on repeatedly retraining attention toward neutral cues. Findings may help elucidate neural mechanisms of ABM and promote the identification of a subset of anxious patients who would be good candidates for this intervention."
"A cognitive model of social anxiety predicts that an early attentional bias leads to greater cognitive processing of social threat signals, whereas the vigilance-avoidance model predicts there will be subsequent reduction in cognitive processing. This study tests these models by examining neural responses to social threat stimuli using Event-related potentials (ERP). 19 women with high trait social anxiety and 19 women with low trait social anxiety viewed emotional expressions (angry, disgusted, happy and neutral) in a passive viewing task whilst ERP responses were recorded. The HSA group revealed greater automatic attention, or hypervigilance, to all facial expressions, as indexed by greater N1 amplitude compared to the LSA group. They also showed greater sustained attention and elaborative processing of all facial expressions, indexed by significantly increased P2 and P3 amplitudes compared to the LSA group. These results support cognitive models of social anxiety, but are not consistent with predictions of the vigilance-avoidance model."
"Anxiety is an adaptive human experience that may occur at all ages and serves to help draw attention to, avoid or cope with immanent threat and danger. Given its evolutionary importance, it has strong genetic and biological underpinnings, and when it serves that adaptive function for the organism, anxiety may be viewed as useful. However, complex adaptive systems, such as our adaptation to threat or stress, by definition provide many and often interrelated points of breakdown or dysregulation, which, if sustained, may lead to psychopathology. Anxiety has been described as a common currency for psychopathology, indicating that it is a first line and universal way for us to respond to stress and threat. It is more or less prominent in patients diagnosed with practically all psychiatric or neurodegenerative disorders. This has lead to the inclusion of anxiety as a cross-cutting symptom measure in the development of DSM-5 (APA, 2013). Given that they are rooted in a complex adaptive system that has many potential points of impact to develop pathology, it is not surprising that anxiety disorders are extremely heterogeneous. This heterogeneity of anxiety disorders pertains to symptomatology, etiology and outcomes, and poses great challenges to both research and clinical practice."
"The acquisition of a conditioned fear response is adaptive, as it enables the organism to appropriately respond to predictors of aversive events. Consequently, the absence of predictive cues can be used as a signal for safety. We aimed to study whether deficient fear conditioning might lead to maladaptive fear. Following previous work, we predicted that failure to learn the CS-US association would result in higher contextual fear, and that participants who failed to learn would tend to exhibit higher trait anxiety. Conditioning took place in a virtual environment with two contexts. In one of the two contexts, offset of a CS (light) was associated with a shock. Each participant visited two places (a house and an apartment) in each of 12 blocks. In one of these places shocks were administered at the offset of an 8-s period of lights on (CS). The results showed that half of the participants demonstrated differential shock expectancy between situations in the shock context in which the CS was present versus absent. This indicates that these participants learned the contingencies between the shocks and both the context and the light CS. In contrast, the other half of the participants learned only the association with the context. As predicted, learning the CS-US contingency resulted in reduced self-reported fear in the absence of the CS in the danger context compared to the presence of the CS. On the other hand, participants who failed to learn the association displayed a sustained aversive state throughout the duration of the danger context. Skin conductance measures confirmed this pattern of results. Fear-potentiated startle during the threat context compared to the safe context was significant in both groups, while startle was only potentiated during the CS in the threat context in the group that learned the CS association (trend-level significant). Finally, scores on Spielberger's self-report scale of trait anxiety tended to be higher in the group of participants who did not learn the CS-shock association in the danger context compared to participants who did. In conclusion, these results confirm higher contextual fear in participants who did not acquire a conditioned response to the cue in comparison to participants who did. Also, virtual reality contexts provide a useful tool for the study of context conditioning."
"Anxiety has wide reaching effects on cognition; evidenced most prominently by the ""difficulties concentrating"" seen in anxiety disorders, and by adaptive harm-avoidant behaviors adopted under threatening circumstances. Despite having critical implications for daily-living, the precise impact of anxiety on cognition is as yet poorly quantified. Here we attempt to clarify the impact of anxiety on sustained attention and response inhibition via a translational anxiety induction in healthy individuals (N = 22). Specifically, in a within-subjects design, participants completed the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) in which subjects withhold responses to infrequent no-go stimuli under threat of unpredictable electrical shock (anxious) and safe (non-anxious) conditions. Different studies have argued that this task measures either (1) attention lapses due to off-task thinking or (2) response inhibition; two cognitive functions which are likely impacted by anxiety. We show that threat of shock significantly reduces errors of commission on the no-go trials relative to the safe condition whilst having no effect on go trials or overall reaction time (RT). We suggest that this is because threat of shock during SART promotes response inhibition. In particular we argue that, by virtue of frequency, subjects acquire a habitual bias toward a go response which impairs no-go performance and that threat of shock improves the ability to withhold these prepotent responses. This improved response inhibition likely falls within the range of adaptive cognitive functions which promote cautious harm avoidance under threatening conditions, although a range of alternative explanations for this effect is discussed."
"Twenty-four hours of TCR engagement and CD28 costimulation was found sufficient to elicit an optimal rate of cell division over a 72-h period only when a high concentration of IL-2 was produced in the culture and remained readily available to the CD4(+) T cells. The cell division response could be aborted following 24 h of stimulation by the simultaneous abrogation of IL-2R signaling and the blockade of CD28 or TCR ligands. Biochemical and pharmacologic studies indicated that a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling cascade costimulated by the TCR and CD28 maintained the blasting cell division rate at a maximal level beyond 24 h even when IL-2 was withdrawn, neutralized, or exhausted. These data show that CD4(+) T cells remain sensitive to antigens (Ag) and costimulatory signals throughout the clonal expansion response. Furthermore, only those T cells that perceive the presence of a continued threat in the form of Ag/MHC complexes and B7 costimulatory ligands or a high concentration of a growth factor are directed to remain in cell cycle."
"Maladaptive patterns of attention to emotional stimuli are a common feature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with growing evidence supporting sustained attention to threatening stimuli across trauma samples. However, it remains unclear how different PTSD symptom clusters are associated with attentional bias patterns, particularly in urban civilian settings with high rates of trauma exposure and PTSD. The present study examined associations among these variables in 70 traumatized primarily African American women. PTSD was measured using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, and eye tracking was used to measure patterns of attention as participants engaged in an attention bias (dot probe) task to emotional faces; average initial fixation (1 s) and dwell duration (overall time spent looking at emotional face versus neutral face across the 5 s task) were used to assess attention bias patterns toward emotional faces. Women with PTSD showed significantly longer dwell duration toward angry faces than women without PTSD (F = 5.16, p < .05). Bivariate correlation analyses with the PTSD symptom clusters showed a significant association between average initial fixation toward angry faces and higher levels of avoidance symptoms (r = 0.29, p < .05) as well as sustained attention to angry faces and higher levels of re-experiencing symptoms (r = 0.24, p < .05). Using separate linear regression models based on initial significant correlations, we found that PTSD avoidance symptoms were significantly related to average initial fixation toward angry faces (R (2) = 0.09, p < .05) and PTSD re-experiencing symptoms were significantly related to dwell duration toward angry faces (R (2) = 0.06, p < .05). These findings contribute to evidence that PTSD is related to both initial vigilance and sustained attention to threat and that certain symptom clusters may either drive or be more impacted by attentional biases, highlighting the benefits of addressing attentional biases within treatment."
"BACKGROUND: Various models for organising tactical emergency medicine support (TEMS) in law enforcement operations exist. In Helsinki, TEMS is organised as an integral part of emergency medical service (EMS) and applied in hostage, siege, bomb threat and crowd control situations and in other tactical situations after police request. Our aim was to analyse TEMS operations, patient profile, and the level of on-site care provided. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of TEMS operations in Helsinki from 2004 to 2009. Data were retrieved from EMS, hospital and dispatching centre files and from TEMS reports. RESULTS: One hundred twenty TEMS operations were analysed. Median time from dispatching to arrival on scene was 10 min [Interquartile Range (IQR) 7-14]. Median duration of operations was 41 min (IQR 19-63). Standby was the only activity in 72 operations, four patients were dead on arrival, 16 requests were called off en route and patient examination or care was needed in 28 operations. Twenty-eight patients (records retrieved) were alive on arrival and were classified as trauma (n = 12) or medical (n = 16). Of traumas, two sustained a gunshot wound, one sustained a penetrating abdominal wound, three sustained medium severity injuries and nine sustained minor injuries. There was neither on-scene nor in-hospital mortality among patients who were alive on arrival. The level of on-site care performed was basic life support in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that TEMS integrated to daily EMS services including safe zone working only was a feasible, rapid and efficient way to provide medical support to law enforcement operations."
"Acute intoxication with organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitors (OPs) is a significant human health threat, and current medical countermeasures for OP poisoning are of limited therapeutic efficacy. The rat model of acute intoxication with diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) is increasingly being used to test candidate compounds for efficacy in protecting against the immediate and long-term consequences of acute OP toxicity. In this model, rats are typically pretreated with pyridostigmine bromide (PB), a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor, to enhance survival. However, PB pretreatment is not likely in most scenarios of civilian exposure to acutely neurotoxic levels of OPs. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine whether PB pretreatment significantly increases survival in DFP-intoxicated rats. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were injected with DFP (4 mg/kg, s.c.) or vehicle (VEH) followed 1 min later by combined i.m. injection of atropine sulfate (2 mg/kg) and 2-pralidoxime (25 mg/kg). Animals were pretreated 30 min prior to these injections with PB (0.1 mg/kg, i.m.) or an equal volume of saline. DFP triggered rapid and sustained seizure behavior irrespective of PB pretreatment, and there was no significant difference in average seizure behavior score during the first 4 h following injection between DFP animals pretreated with PB or not. PB pretreatment also had no significant effect on survival or brain AChE activity at 24 h post-DFP exposure. In summary, PB pretreatment is not necessary to ensure survival of rats acutely intoxicated with DFP, and eliminating PB pretreatment in the rat model of acute DFP intoxication would increase its relevance to acute OP intoxication in civilians."
"Seawater temperature is one of the main environmental factors controlling coral skeleton growth. Sustained seawater warming is regarded as a major threat to coral growth and reef development. Coral reefs are widespread in the South China Sea (SCS), where the history and future of coral growth are of great concern. We integrated 99 linear extension rate series of the coral Porites from 12 locations at three regions in SCS, which include the Hainan Island (HN), the Xisha Islands (XS), and the Huangyan Island-Nansha Islands (HY-NS), and explored the regional responses of coral growth to sustained seawater warming. The sea surface temperature (SST) rose linearly by 0.47 degrees C, 0.71 degrees C, and 0.76 degrees C at HN, XS, and HY-HN, respectively, between 1900 and 2014. During this period, coral growth increased linearly by ~21.0% and ~0.7% at HN and XS, while HY-NS saw a decline of ~2.8% in coral growth. Moreover, interdecadal variations were found for both SST and coral growth. A nonlinear response relationship was revealed between coral growth and SST, with a thermal optimum of ~27.5 degrees C for Porites, which is responsible for the regional difference in the long-term trend in coral growth in SCS. In recent decades, reductions in coral growth have occurred in SCS, especially at HN, with the largest fall of ~15.1% over the past century, which is attributed mainly to intensifying human impacts instead of seawater warming. A preliminary estimate presents regional-different coral growths in SCS by the end of 21st century, with declines of ~8.9-16.3% under the atmospheric CO2 emission scenario (RCP 8.5), implying that the overall downturn of coral growth will be inevitable under the future sustained seawater warming in SCS. The mitigation of global warming is essential to maintain coral growth and coral reef ecosystems in SCS."
"Perception and evaluation of objects are highly dependent on surrounding contexts. Threatening contexts enhance processing of faces. Because odors are assumed to deliver strong contextual information, the present study aimed at demonstrating 1) that odors can constitute threat and safety contexts, and 2) consequently modulate the processing of faces presented in these contexts. Therefore, previously neutral odors were used as contextual stimuli in a context conditioning paradigm, resulting in an olfactory anxiety and a safety context. Then, faces showing angry, neutral, or fearful expressions were presented within both contexts during a test phase to investigate the effects of threat versus safety contexts on face perception. The late positive potential (LPP) from the EEG, skin conductance level, and subjective ratings were recorded. Results reveal successful olfactory context conditioning as reflected in enhanced processing of the anxiety context, indicated by enhanced LPP after conditioning, increased skin conductance level, and marginally respectively increased ratings. Moreover, faces presented within the threat context were rated as more unpleasant and marginally more arousing than faces presented in the safety context. Thus, olfactory stimuli can serve as context in fear conditioning, and a threatening olfactory context seems to enhance processing of stimuli perceived within this context."
"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is increasingly seen as a major public health problem, threat, and concern worldwide. In Yemen about 1.7% of the population is infected with chronic hepatitis C. This study aimed to detect the predictors for response to pegylated interferon and ribavirin (Peg-IFN/RBV) in chronic HCV Yemeni patients. The study was conducted on 100 patients with chronic HCV who received Peg-IFN/RBV in the 48th Military Hospital in Sana'a Yemen, from 2011 to 2013. All patients were subjected to complete history taking, thorough clinical examinations, routine laboratory investigation, and abdominal ultrasonography. The HCV RNA was assessed at week 72 of treatment to detect whether the patient achieved sustained virological response (SVR). The SVR was achieved in 64% of the samples. Age above 40, Khat chewing, and obesity were the sociodemographic factors that predict good response for Peg-IFN/RBV combined therapy. Platelet count, alpha feto-protein (AFP), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels were the basic laboratory investigations that gave favorable response. Significant predictors of sustained response included: older than 40 years (OR = 0.136, P = 0.042), Khat chewer (OR = 0.016, P = 0.008), body mass index (BMI) (OR = 0.055, P = 0.029) and increase in fasting blood glucose (OR = 0.925, P = 0.004), alkaline phosphatase (OR = 0.969, P = 0.001), total and bilirubin (OR = 0.058, P = 0.017), AST (OR = 1.033, P = 0.002), and albumin (OR = 6.490, P = 0.021). Studying the independent variables of response, we revealed that male gender, BMI, ALT >40, AFP >10, viremia >600, and hemoglobin and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are variables associated with failure of end of treatment response (ETR) and SVR."
"According to the mode of transmission, Staphylococcus aureus infection between hosts is classified as ""direct zoonoses,"" or infection that is transmitted from an infected vertebrate host to a susceptible host (man) by direct contact, by contact with a fomite or by a mechanical vector. The agent itself undergoes little or no propagative or developmental changes during transmission. According to the reservoir host, staphylococcosis is most precisely defined as ""zooanthroponoses"" or infections transmitted from man to lower vertebrate animals (e.g., streptococci, diphtheria, Enterobacteriaceae, human tuberculosis in cattle and parrots), but also ""anthropozoonoses"" or infections transmitted to man from lower vertebrate animals. In particular, actually, the correct definition of S. aureus infections between humans and animals is ""amphixenoses"" or infections maintained in both man and lower vertebrate animals and transmitted in either direction. S. aureus exhibits tropisms to many distinct animal hosts. While spillover events can occur wherever there is an interface between host species, changes in host tropism only occur with the establishment of sustained transmission in the new host species, leading to clonal expansion. Although the genomic variation underpinning adaptation in S. aureus genotypes infecting bovids and poultry has been well characterized, the frequency of switches from one host to another remains obscure. In this review, we sought to identify the sustained switches in host tropism in the S. aureus population, both anthroponotic and zoonotic, and their distribution over the species phylogeny. S. aureus is an organism with the capacity to switch into and adapt to novel hosts, even after long periods of isolation in a single host species. Based on this evidence, animal-adapted S. aureus lineages exhibiting resistance to antibiotics must be considered a major threat to public health, as they can adapt to the human population."
"BACKGROUND: Cervical spine fracture-dislocations in neurologically intact patients represent a surgical challenge due to the risk of inflicting iatrogenic spinal cord compression by closed reduction maneuvers. The use of MRI for early advanced imaging in these injuries remains controversially debated. CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year old man sustained a fall over the handlebars of his racing bicycle. The helmeted patient sustained a fall on his head which resulted in a hyperflexion injury of the neck. He was neurologically intact on presentation. Initial CT imaging revealed a complex multisegmental cervical spine injury with a left-sided C6/C7 perched facet, a right sided C7/T1 fracture-dislocation, and a right-sided C6 and C7 traumatic laminotomy. The initial management consisted of temporary external Halo fixator application without closed reduction maneuver, to mitigate the risk of a delayed spinal cord injury. Subsequent advanced imaging by MRI revealed an acute traumatic C7/T1 disc herniation, with the intervertebral disc completely extruded into the spinal canal. Definitive surgical management was then accomplished by employing a three-stage anterior-posterior-anterior spinal decompression, realignment, fixation and fusion C4-T2 in one operative session. The patient recovered well and retained full neurological function. He resumed bicycle street racing within 10 months of the injury following successful spinal reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic evaluation of cervical fracture-dislocations should include advanced imaging by MRI in order to fully understand the injury pattern prior to proceeding with spinal reduction maneuvers which may impose the imminent threat of a devastating iatrogenic injury to the spinal cord. The presented staged management by initial Halo fixation without attempts for spinal reduction, followed by a surgical decompression and multilevel fusion, appears to represent a feasible and safe strategy for patients at risk of a delayed neurological injury."
"Improvised explosive devices and mines pose a formidable threat to military convoys traveling in Iraq. This study evaluated battle injuries sustained by a mechanized battalion operating against this threat. The objective was to gain insight into injury profiles and prevention. In the period examined, 32 attacks injured 120 Marines, causing 188 injuries. Upper extremity and head injuries (70%) were common, whereas lower extremity injuries (11%) were rare (as expected, given the threat and the body areas exposed). Shoulder and axilla protectors may be beneficial, but lower arm and hand injuries remain difficult to combat. Ear injury was the most common single injury type (23%). Combat earplugs may reduce ear blast injuries. Eye injuries were uncommon (0.5%), likely because of ballistic eye protection. Injury to the torso (11%) was generally mild, because of body armor vests. The majority of wounds were minor, allowing > 80% of the injured Marines to return to duty."
"Organophosphate (OP) chemicals include pesticides such as parathion, and nerve gases such as sarin and soman and are considered major chemical threat agents. Acute OP exposure is associated with a cholinergic crisis and status epilepticus (SE). It is also known that the survivors of OP toxicity exhibit neurobehavioral deficits such as mood changes, depression, and memory impairment, and acquired epilepsy. Our research has focused on addressing the need to develop effective therapeutic agents that could be administered even after prolonged seizures and would prevent or lessen the chronic morbidity associated with OP-SE survival. We have developed rat survival models of OP pesticide metabolite paraoxon (POX) and nerve agent sarin surrogate diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) induced SE that are being used to screen for medical countermeasures against an OP attack. Our research has focused on studying neuronal calcium (Ca(2+)) homeostatic mechanisms for identifying mechanisms and therapeutics for the expression of neurological morbidities associated with OP-SE survival. We have observed development of a ""Ca(2+) plateau"" characterized by sustained elevations in neuronal Ca(2+) levels in OP-SE surviving rats that coincided with the appearance of OP-SE chronic morbidities. These Ca(2+) elevations had their origin in Ca(2+) release from the intracellular stores such that blockade with antagonists like dantrolene, carisbamate, and levetiracetam lowered OP-SE mediated Ca(2+) plateau and afforded significant neuroprotection. Since the Ca(2+) plateau lasts for a prolonged period, our studies suggest that blocking it after the control of SE may represent a unique target for development of novel countermeasures to prevent long term Ca(2+) mediated OP-SE neuropsychiatric comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, and acquired epilepsy (AE)."
"Diabetes, a global epidemic, has become a serious threat to public health. The present study is aimed at constructing an injectable thermosensitive PEG-polyester hydrogel formulation of liraglutide (Lira), a ""smart"" antidiabetic polypeptide, in the long-acting treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of three thermosensitive poly(epsilon-caprolactone-co-glycolic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(epsilon-caprolactone-co-glycolic acid) (PCGA-PEG-PCGA) triblock copolymers with similar molecular weights but different epsilon-caprolactone-to-glycolide (CL-to-GA) ratios were synthesized. The polymer aqueous solutions exhibited free-flowing sols at room temperature and formed in situ hydrogels at body temperature. While the different bulk morphologies, stabilities of aqueous solutions, and the varying in vivo persistence time of hydrogels in ICR mice were found among the three copolymers, all of the Lira-loaded gel formulations exhibited a sustained drug release manner in vitro regardless of CL-to-GA ratios. The specimen with a powder form in the bulk state, a stable aqueous solution before heating, and an appropriate degradation rate in vivo was selected as the optimal carrier to evaluate the in vivo efficacy. A single injection of the optimal gel formulation showed a remarkable hypoglycemic efficacy up to 1 week in diabetic db/db mice. Furthermore, three successive administrations of this gel formulation within one month significantly lowered glycosylated hemoglobin and protected islets of db/db mice. As a result, a promising once-weekly delivery system of Lira was developed, which not only afforded long-term glycemic control but also significantly improved patient compliance."
"UNLABELLED: Adolescent depression is a growing public health concern with an increased risk of negative health outcomes, including suicide. The use of antidepressants and psychotherapy has not halted its increasing prevalence, and there is a critical need for effective prevention and treatment. We reviewed the neuroscience of adolescent depression, with a focus on the neurocircuitry of sustained threat and summarised contextual factors that have an impact on brain development and the pathophysiology of depression. We also reviewed novel treatment models. CONCLUSION: Attention to the relevant neurocircuitry and contextual factors implicated in adolescent depression is necessary to advance prevention and treatment development."
"Malaria control program in the Arabian Peninsula, backed by adequate logistical support, has interrupted transmission with exception of limited sites in Saudi Arabia and sporadic outbreaks in Oman. However, sustained influx of imported malaria represents a direct threat to the above success. Here we examined the extent of genetic diversity among imported P. vivax in Qatar, and its ability to produce gametocytes, compared to parasites in main sites of imported cases, the Indian subcontinent (india) and East Africa (Sudan and Ethiopia). High diversity was seen among imported P. vivax in Qatar, comparable to parasites in the Indian subcontinent and East Africa. Limited genetic differentiation was seen among imported P. vivax, which overlapped with parasites in India, but differentiated from that in Sudan and Ethiopia. Parasite density among imported cases, ranged widely between 26.25-7985934.1 Pv18S rRNA copies/microl blood, with a high prevalence of infections carried gametocytes detectable by qRT-PCR. Parasitaemia was a stronger predictor for P. vivax gametocytes density (r = 0.211, P = 0.04). The extensive diversity of imported P. vivax and its ability to produce gametocytes represent a major threat for re-introduction of malaria in Qatar. The genetic relatedness between P. vivax reported in Qatar and those in India suggest that elimination strategy should target flow and dispersal of imported malaria into the region."
"Two classification systems are now at the forefront of clinical psychiatric research: (1) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition and (2) the National Institutes of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria. Herein, we propose that these two classification systems are complementary rather than mutually exclusive, and when combined provide important information for understanding aspects of the pathophysiology related to Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The neurobiological literature for GAD and one relevant research domain criteria component, sustained threat, are reviewed from multiple units of analysis (genetic, neuroimaging, neuroendocrine, and psychophysiological). It is hypothesized that generating a comprehensive, biologically based understanding of the relationship between GAD, sustained threat, and the measureable units of analysis will provide information critical to design the most effective treatments."
"The angry facial expression is an important socially threatening stimulus argued to have evolved to regulate social hierarchies. In the present study, event-related potentials (ERP) were used to investigate the involvement and temporal dynamics of the frontal and parietal regions in the processing of angry facial expressions. Angry, happy and neutral faces were shown to eighteen healthy right-handed volunteers in a passive viewing task. Stimulus-locked ERPs were recorded from the frontal and parietal scalp sites. The P200, N300 and early contingent negativity variation (eCNV) components of the electric brain potentials were investigated. Analyses revealed statistical significant reductions in P200 amplitudes for the angry facial expression on both frontal and parietal electrode sites. Furthermore, apart from being strongly associated with the anterior P200, the N300 showed to be more negative for the angry facial expression in the anterior regions also. Finally, the eCNV was more pronounced over the parietal sites for the angry facial expressions. The present study demonstrated specific electrocortical correlates underlying the processing of angry facial expressions in the anterior and posterior brain sectors. The P200 is argued to indicate valence tagging by a fast and early detection mechanism. The lowered N300 with an anterior distribution for the angry facial expressions indicates more elaborate evaluation of stimulus relevance. The fact that the P200 and the N300 are highly correlated suggests that they reflect different stages of the same anterior evaluation mechanism. The more pronounced posterior eCNV suggests sustained attention to socially threatening information."
"A genetic polymorphism within the gene encoding the pituitary adenylate cyclase- activating polypeptide (PACAP) receptor type I (PAC1R) has recently been associated with hyper-reactivity to threat-related cues in women, but not men, with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PACAP is a highly conserved peptide, whose role in mediating adaptive physiological stress responses is well established. Far less is understood about the contribution of PACAP signaling in emotional learning and memory, particularly the encoding of fear to discrete cues. Moreover, a neurobiological substrate that may account for the observed link between PAC1R and PTSD in women, but not men, has yet to be identified. Sex differences in PACAP signaling during emotional learning could provide novel targets for the treatment of PTSD. Here we investigated the contribution of PAC1R signaling within the prefrontal cortex to the acquisition of cued fear in female and male rats. We used a variant of fear conditioning called trace fear conditioning, which requires sustained attention to fear cues and depends on working-memory like neuronal activity within the prefrontal cortex. We found that cued fear learning, but not spatial working memory, was impaired by administration of a PAC1R antagonist directly into the prelimbic area of the prefrontal cortex. This effect was specific to females. We also found that levels of mRNA for the PAC1R receptor in the prelimbic cortex were greater in females compared with males, and were highest during and immediately following the proestrus stage of the estrous cycle. Together, these results demonstrate a sex-specific role of PAC1R signaling in learning about threat-related cues."
"RATIONALE: Preclinical data indicates that threat stimuli elicit two classes of defensive behaviors, those that are associated with imminent danger and are characterized by flight or fight (fear), and those that are associated with temporally uncertain danger and are characterized by sustained apprehension and hypervigilance (anxiety). OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the study are to (1) review evidence for a distinction between fear and anxiety in animal and human experimental models using the startle reflex as an operational measure of aversive states, (2) describe experimental models of anxiety, as opposed to fear, in humans, (3) examine the relevance of these models to clinical anxiety. RESULTS: The distinction between phasic fear to imminent threat and sustained anxiety to temporally uncertain danger is suggested by psychopharmacological and behavioral evidence from ethological studies and can be traced back to distinct neuroanatomical systems, the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Experimental models of anxiety, not fear, are relevant to non-phobic anxiety disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Progress in our understanding of normal and abnormal anxiety is critically dependent on our ability to model sustained aversive states to temporally uncertain threat."
"The high evolutionary value of learning when to respond to threats or when to inhibit previously learned associations after changing threat contingencies is reflected in dedicated networks in the animal and human brain. Recent evidence further suggests that adaptive learning may be dependent on the dynamic interaction of meta-stable functional brain networks. However, it is still unclear which functional brain networks compete with each other to facilitate associative learning and how changes in threat contingencies affect this competition. The aim of this study was to assess the dynamic competition between large-scale networks related to associative learning in the human brain by combining a repeated differential conditioning and extinction paradigm with independent component analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data. The results (i) identify three task-related networks involved in initial and sustained conditioning as well as extinction, and demonstrate that (ii) the two main networks that underlie sustained conditioning and extinction are anti-correlated with each other and (iii) the dynamic competition between these two networks is modulated in response to changes in associative contingencies. These findings provide novel evidence for the view that dynamic competition between large-scale functional networks differentiates fear conditioning from extinction learning in the healthy brain and suggest that dysfunctional network dynamics might contribute to learning-related neuropsychiatric disorders."
"Social anxiety is theorised to arise from sustained over-activation of a mammalian evolved system for detecting and responding to social threat with corresponding diminished opportunities for attaining the pleasure of safe attachments. Emotional forecasting data from two holidays were used to test the hypothesis that greater social anxiety would be associated with decreased expectations of positive affect (PA) and greater anticipated negative affect (NA) on a holiday marked by group celebration (St. Patrick's Day) while being associated with greater predicted PA for daters on a romantic holiday (Valentine's Day). Participants completed symptom reports, made affective forecasts and provided multiple affect reports throughout each holiday. Higher levels of social anxiety were associated with greater anticipated PA for Valentine's Day daters, but lower experienced PA on the holiday; this was not found for trait anxiety and depression. Alternatively, trait anxiety, depression and social anxiety were associated with less predicted PA for St. Patrick's Day, greater anticipated NA and diminished experienced PA/greater NA during the holiday. Results are discussed in light of perceived hope for rewarding safe emotional contact for those daters in contrast to the greater possibility for social threat associated with group celebration typical of St. Patrick's Day."
"Studying the effects of experimentally induced anxiety in healthy volunteers may increase our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning anxiety disorders. Experimentally induced stress (via threat of unpredictable shock) improves accuracy at withholding a response on the sustained attention to response task (SART), and in separate studies improves accuracy to classify fearful faces, creating an affective bias. Integrating these findings, participants at two public science engagement events (n = 46, n = 55) were recruited to explore the effects of experimentally induced stress on an affective version of the SART. We hypothesized that we would see an improved accuracy at withholding a response to affectively congruent stimuli (i.e. increased accuracy at withholding a response to fearful 'no-go' distractors) under threat of shock. Induced anxiety slowed reaction time, and at the second event quicker responses were made to fearful stimuli. However, we did not observe improved inhibition overall during induced anxiety, and there was no evidence to suggest an interaction between induced anxiety and stimulus valence on response accuracy. Indeed Bayesian analysis provided decisive evidence against this hypothesis. We suggest that the presence of emotional stimuli might make the safe condition more anxiogenic, reducing the differential between conditions and knocking out any threat-potentiated improvement."
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: During February 1998, there was heightened tension in the Persian Gulf area. Iraq's ruler, Saddam Hussein, threatened Israeli citizens with the use of biological weapons. This study observed the use of health care services by patients visiting our clinics during this period. METHODS: During the period of February 17, 1998, through March 1, 1998, 12 family physicians classified all clinic visits as ""related"" or ""unrelated"" to the crisis. The participating clinics were situated in (A) high-risk and (B) low-risk areas, according to their location as related to missile hits during the 1991 Gulf War. RESULTS: A total of 1,841 visits were recorded during the crisis period (February 17-23). There were 934 visits in Area A and 907 in Area B. Overall, 194 visits related to the crisis were recorded, of which 155 were in Area A. The rate of crisis-related visits was higher in Area A (16.6% versus 3.4%). There were more visits for authorizations for special masks (8.2% versus .8%), requests for information (3.9% versus 1.3%), and tranquilizers (2.1% versus .5%). In the period subsequent to the agreement reached on February 24, crisis-related visits declined sharply in both areas. CONCLUSIONS: During the crisis, there was an increase in visits related to the threat of biological warfare. The phenomenon was more pronounced in areas that had sustained missile hits during the 1991 Gulf War."
"The vast majority of persons with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection will achieve virologic cure with the current direct-acting antiviral therapies. Prevention of reinfection is an important aspect of postcure management and key to the elimination of HCV infection globally. Equally important aspects of postcure care are the prevention of liver disease progression and the management of complications in patients who have significant fibrosis at the time of achieving cure. Patients with advanced fibrosis need to remain under surveillance for liver complications, including hepatocellular carcinoma. All patients are potentially at risk for liver disease progression if other factors causing liver injury are present, such as harmful levels of alcohol use or risk factors for fatty liver including obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic comorbidities. Fatty liver is a particular threat to the long-term well-being of patients after HCV cure due to the high prevalence of its risk factors in this population. Strong counseling messages and ongoing monitoring are key."
"Viral liver diseases are frequent comorbidities and major contributors to death in HIV-positive individuals on antiretroviral therapy. Although cure of hepatitis C and control of hepatitis B with antivirals avert liver disease progression in most HIV-coinfected patients, the lack of satisfactory treatment for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection remains a major threat for developing cirrhosis and liver cancer in this population. In the European Union (EU) and North America, sexual contact has replaced injection drug use that has been the major transmission route for HDV in HIV-positive persons. PegIFNalpha is the only approved HDV therapy; however, sustained HDV-RNA clearance is achieved by less than 25%. The recent discovery of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide as the key hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV cell entry receptor has opened the door to a new therapeutic era. Indeed, promising results have been released using Myrcludex-B, a sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide inhibitor. More encouraging are data with new classes of HDV blockers, such as prenylation inhibitors (i.e. lonafarnib) and nucleic acid polymers. At this time, sustained suppression of HDV replication is the primary goal of HDV therapy, as it is associated with normalization of liver enzymes and histological improvement. Of note, the use of specific antivirals for HDV must be given along with anti-HBV agents to prevent HBV rebounds following removal of viral interference. The lack of persistent forms of HDV-RNA could provide a unique opportunity for curing hepatitis delta, even without eliminating HBV circular covalently closed DNA. Ultimately, suppression of HDV replication along with hepatitis B surface antigen clearance once drugs are off would be the best reflect of hepatitis delta cure."
"Malaria remains a serious threat to global health. Sustained malaria control and, eventually, eradication will only be achieved with a broadly effective malaria vaccine. Yet a fundamental lack of knowledge about how antimalarial immunity is acquired has hindered vaccine development efforts to date. Understanding how malaria-causing parasites modulate the host immune system, specifically dendritic cells (DCs), key initiators of adaptive and vaccine antigen-based immune responses, is vital for effective vaccine design. This review comprehensively summarizes how exposure to Plasmodium spp. impacts human DC function in vivo and in vitro. We have highlighted the heterogeneity of the data observed in these studies, compared and critiqued the models used to generate our current understanding of DC function in malaria, and examined the mechanisms by which Plasmodium spp. mediate these effects. This review highlights potential research directions which could lead to improved efficacy of existing vaccines, and outlines novel targets for next-generation vaccine strategies to target malaria."
"Inside and outside of psychoanalysis, laughter has often been thought of as relating to anxiety, with the usual line being that laughter can be a response to anxiety or a way of dealing with it. This article argues that laughter cannot be said to eradicate or 'deal with' anxiety and that laughter is always unsettling precisely because it contains anxiety and indicates its continuing threat. The article discusses Freud and Lacan on anxiety, as well as Charles Mauron, an understudied writer whose Psychocritique du Genre Comique was the only sustained study of psychoanalysis and comedy until very recently. I argue here that Mauron's idea of renversement holds a key to understanding the relationship between laughter and anxiety. Rather than using a collection of isolated examples to illustrate individual points, in the second half of the article I provide a more sustained discussion of these ideas in relation to Nicolai Gogol's short story ""The Overcoat."""
"Aggressive behavior is observed in persons with various mental health problems and has been studied from the perspectives of neuroscience and psychophysiology. The present research reviews some of the extant experimental literature to help clarify the interplay between domains of functioning implicated in aggression proneness. We then convey a process-oriented model that elucidates how the interplay of the Negative Valence and Cognitive System domains of NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) helps explain aggression proneness, particularly reactive aggression. Finally, we report on a study involving event-related potential (ERP) indices of emotional and inhibitory control processing during an emotional-linguistic go/no-go task among 67 individuals with histories of violence and criminal offending (30% female, 44% African-American) who reported on their aggressive tendencies using the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire. Results provide evidence that tendencies toward angry and aggressive behavior relate to reduced inhibitory control processing (no-go P3) specifically during relevant threat-word blocks, suggesting deterioration of cognitive control by acute or sustained threat sensitivity. These findings highlight the value of ERP methodologies for clarifying the interplay of Negative Valence and Cognitive System processes in aggression proneness."
"Chronic viral hepatitis is a global health threat and financial burden. Hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) are the most common causes of chronic viral hepatitis in the United States. Most cases are asymptomatic before adulthood. Research has resulted in effective therapy for HCV and the promise of effective therapies for HBV. For HCV, therapy is pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Clinical trials with effective direct-acting antiviral agents are underway in pediatrics. For HBV, approved agents are alpha-interferon, lamivudine, adefovir, tenofovir, and entecavir. However, treatment seldom results in functional cure and more effective therapies are urgently needed."
"Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease has emerged as a major public health concern. Yet, understanding of the global burden is incomplete, limited particularly by the breadth of blood culture-based surveillance systems that are able to accurately diagnose the etiology of bacteremia. The accessibility of whole genome sequencing has allowed for genetic characterization of pathogens, shedding light on its evolutionary history and sounding alerts for its future progression. iNTS disease is observed to be a particular threat in sub-Saharan Africa, with a case fatality rate greatly exceeding that of typhoid fever, and commonly affecting infants, young children and immunocompromised adults. While iNTS disease might also be a threat in Asia and Latin America, its burden is not well characterized, primarily owing to the lack of comprehensive reporting in these regions. Drug-resistant Salmonella enterica (S. enterica) serovars (e.g. Typhimurium sequence type 313 (ST313)) have emerged as a potential consequence of sustained antibiotic pressure. Genetic analyses have identified distinguished iNTS disease-causing strains that are particularly virulent in certain human host populations. Effective treatment strategies, including vaccination, are necessary; iNTS vaccines targeting the most common S. enterica serovars, Typhimurium, Enteritidis and Dublin, are currently in early developmental stages. Funding and political support is needed to promote vaccine development and implementation programs to ultimately reduce the threat of iNTS disease in high risk areas."
"In this article, I describe how the current practice of classifying as a stressor any event that is accompanied by a change in any of a number of biological or behavioral measures-even when it is not accompanied by a long-term compromise in an organism's health or capacity to cope with daily challenges-has limited the utility of this concept. This permissive posture, which began with Selye's writings more than 65 years ago, is sustained by the public's desire for a simple term that might explain the tension generated by the threat of terrorists, growing economic inequality, increased competiveness in the workplace or for admission to the best universities, rogue nuclear bombs, and media reports of threats to health in food and water. I believe that the concept stress should be limited to select events that pose a serious threat to an organism's well-being or discarded as too ambiguous to be theoretically useful."
"Threat stimuli typically elicit a psychophysiological response pattern supporting the organism's preparation for active defence. Differently, blood stimuli prompt a distinctive autonomic response pattern and sustained processing, which do not call for clear-cut mobilisation for action. However, the contribution of motor disposition in these response patterns remains unclear. One way to address this issue is to investigate whether threat and blood stimuli differentially affect the active suppression of an ongoing motor activity. Thirty-two undergraduates were presented with threat, mutilation, pleasant, and neutral pictures in an emotional Go/NoGo task. The amplitudes of the NoGo-N2 and NoGo-P3 components of the event-related potentials were analysed as indices of conflict monitoring and inhibition of motor response, respectively. Reaction times to Go trials were significantly faster for threat than for mutilations. The NoGo-N2 was significantly larger to threat than to mutilations, whereas the NoGo-P3amplitude did not differ between the two conditions. These findings suggest that threat stimuli facilitated the execution of a prepotent response and enhanced conflict monitoring when action must be withheld. In contrast, blood stimuli did not either promote action in the Go trials or increase conflict in the NoGo condition, suggesting a response pattern compatible with defensive immobility."
"BACKGROUND: Chronic hypervigilance, a state of sustained alertness and hyperarousal in the absence of threat, has been shown to predict poorer clinical outcomes post-trauma. An exaggerated and persistent amygdala alerting response to affective information has been proposed as a reactivity-based, and thus indirect, marker of hypervigilance. However, because chronic hypervigilance is a persistent rather than reactive state, it should be directly observable under resting-state conditions without the need for exposure to affectively charged stimuli. OBJECTIVE: We tested resting amygdala connectivity and basal sympathetic and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity as direct neural and neuroendocrine markers of chronic hypervigilance. PARTICIPANTS: 24 trauma-exposed women (age M = 22.9, SD = 5.5) and 20 no-trauma controls (age M = 21.1, SD = 3.2). MEASURES: Amygdala connectivity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging at rest and during viewing of novel and familiar affective scenes. Elevated amygdala connectivity during the viewing of novel scenes (exaggerated alerting response) and familiar scenes (persistent alerting response) was used as a reactivity-based index of hypervigilance. Resting amygdala connectivity and basal salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) and cortisol were tested as neural and neuroendocrine markers of hypervigilance, respectively. RESULTS: Compared to no-trauma controls, trauma-exposed women showed greater connectivity between the left amygdala and the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) both during affective processing and at rest. Exaggerated neural novelty response was associated with greater resting left amygdala-vACC connectivity and higher basal sAA, but not cortisol. CONCLUSIONS: Greater synchronization of threat-detection circuitry in the absence of threat and basal sympathetic tone might serve as complementary resting-state markers of the cognitive and physiological components of chronic hypervigilance, respectively."
"Anxiety disorders are characterized by enhanced reactivity to threat, and event-related potentials (ERPs) are useful neural measures of the dynamics of threat processing. In particular, the late positive potential (LPP) is an ERP component that reflects sustained attention towards motivationally salient information. Previous studies in adults suggest that the LPP is enhanced to threatening stimuli in anxiety but blunted in depression; however, very little work has evaluated the LPP to threat in anxious youth. We measured the LPP during an emotional face-matching task in youth (age 7-19) with current anxiety disorders (n = 53) and healthy controls with no history of psychopathology (n = 37). We evaluated group differences, as well as the effect of depressive symptoms on the LPP. Youth with anxiety disorders exhibited enhanced LPPs to angry and fearful faces 1000-2000 ms after stimulus onset. Higher depressive symptoms were associated with reduced LPPs to angry faces across both groups. Enhanced LPPs to threatening faces were most apparent for social anxiety disorder, as opposed to generalized anxiety disorder or separation anxiety disorder. Results suggest the LPP may be a useful neural measure of threat reactivity in youth with anxiety disorders and highlight the importance of accounting for symptoms of both depression and anxiety when examining emotional processing."
"The human face conveys emotional and social information, but it is not well understood how these two aspects influence face perception. In order to model a group situation, two faces displaying happy, neutral or angry expressions were presented. Importantly, faces were either facing the observer, or they were presented in profile view directed towards, or looking away from each other. In Experiment 1 (n = 64), face pairs were rated regarding perceived relevance, wish-to-interact, and displayed interactivity, as well as valence and arousal. All variables revealed main effects of facial expression (emotional > neutral), face orientation (facing observer > towards > away) and interactions showed that evaluation of emotional faces strongly varies with their orientation. Experiment 2 (n = 33) examined the temporal dynamics of perceptual-attentional processing of these face constellations with event-related potentials. Processing of emotional and neutral faces differed significantly in N170 amplitudes, early posterior negativity (EPN), and sustained positive potentials. Importantly, selective emotional face processing varied as a function of face orientation, indicating early emotion-specific (N170, EPN) and late threat-specific effects (LPP, sustained positivity). Taken together, perceived personal relevance to the observer-conveyed by facial expression and face direction-amplifies emotional face processing within triadic group situations."
"BACKGROUND: In the UK, people with mental disorder thought to pose a high risk of harm to others are usually put in a high-security (special) hospital. Little is known about what happens after that. AIMS: To test a hypothesis that, under current services and laws (from the mid-1980s), no one leaving high-security hospitals remains indefinitely institutionalised. METHOD: The special hospitals' case register was used for case ascertainment and admission data; post-discharge data were collected from multiple sources on patients discharged in 1984 (census date 31.12.1995). RESULTS: In this discharge cohort (n=223), 36 (17%) did not return to the community: 17 died in special hospital and 19 continuously lived in other institutions until death or the census date. Over two-thirds of these had mental illness, were older on admission and had lived longer in special hospital than their better-rehabilitated peers. Offending history was irrelevant to this. Most post-discharge institution time was in open psychiatric hospital, or back in special hospital, not in medium secure units or prison. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis was not sustained, but fewer people never reached the community than before the mid-1980s. Atypical antipsychotics might reduce this number. We found no justification for a new tier of long-term medium secure units."
"INTRODUCTION: Flying a helicopter is a complex psychomotor skill. Fatigue is a serious threat to operational safety, particularly for sustained helicopter operations involving high levels of cognitive information processing and sustained time on task. As part of ongoing research into this issue, the object of this study was to develop a field-deployable helicopter-specific psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) for the purpose of daily performance monitoring of pilots. METHODS: The PVT consists of a laptop computer, a hand-operated joystick, and a set of rudder pedals. Screen-based compensatory tracking task software includes a tracking ball (operated by the joystick) which moves randomly in all directions, and a second tracking ball which moves horizontally (operated by the rudder pedals). The 5-min test requires the pilot to keep both tracking balls centered. RESULTS: This helicopter-specific PVT's portability and integrated data acquisition and storage system enables daily field monitoring of the performance of individual helicopter pilots. The inclusion of a simultaneous foot-operated tracking task ensures divided attention for helicopter pilots as the movement of both tracking balls requires simultaneous inputs. DISCUSSION: This PVT is quick, economical, easy to use, and specific to the operational flying task. It can be used for performance monitoring purposes, and as a general research tool for investigating the psychomotor demands of helicopter operations. While reliability and validity testing is warranted, data acquired from this test could help further our understanding of the effect of various factors (such as fatigue) on helicopter pilot performance, with the potential of contributing to helicopter operational safety."
"With almost 30% of the world population suffering from tuberculosis (TB) including its resurgence in the developed world, better management of this global threat is highly desired. The emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) against first-line drugs and extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) due to misuse of second-line antitubercular drugs (ATDs) is a further concern. Recommended treatment involves long term and multiple drug therapy with severe side effects. In this context, nanostructured systems efficiently encapsulating considerable amounts of ATDs, eliciting controlled, sustained and more profound effect to overcome the need to administer ATDs at high and frequent doses, would assist in improving patient compliance and circumvent hepatotoxicity and/or nephrotoxicity/ocular toxicity/ototoxicity associated with the prevalent first-line chemotherapy. Nanostructured delivery systems constitute a wide range of systems varying from liposomes, micelles, micro- and nanoemulsions, to polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs). Improved bioavailability, solubility, stability and biocompatibility make them an ideal choice for delivery of ATDs. Present review comprehensively covers research carried out on first-line antitubercular drug therapy using these nanostructured systems."
"This study examines the influence of trait anxiety on working memory (WM) in safety and threat. Interactions between experimentally induced anxiety and WM performance (on different cognitive loads) have been reported in healthy, nonanxious subjects. Differences in trait anxiety may moderate these interactions. Accordingly, these interactions may be potentiated by high trait anxiety (HTA), or show a resilient pattern that protects cognitive performance. HTA and low trait anxiety (LTA) were defined by a median split of scores on the trait component of the state-trait anxiety inventory. Sustained anxiety was evoked by a probabilistic exposure to an aversive scream, and was measured by eyeblink startle and self-report. WM was tested using an n-back task (1-, 2-, and 3-back). Results revealed that, as expected, the HTA group reported greater anxiety during the task. However, trait anxiety did not impact the modulation of WM performance by induced anxiety. Notably, HTA influenced anxiety-potentiated startle (startle during threat minus startle during safe; APS) differently as a function of memory load. Accordingly, APS decreased with increasing WM load, but HTA antagonized this reduction. The HTA group showed no impairment on the 3-back WM task despite a higher APS. The amplified APS could be associated with the increase in effort-related cognitive arousal. Furthermore, this third replication of the interaction of induced anxiety by load on WM performance testifies to the robustness of the unique interplay between anxiety and WM."
"A general theory of domain identification is used to describe achievement barriers still faced by women in advanced quantitative areas and by African Americans in school. The theory assumes that sustained school success requires identification with school and its subdomains; that societal pressures on these groups (e.g., economic disadvantage, gender roles) can frustrate this identification; and that in school domains where these groups are negatively stereotyped, those who have become domain identified face the further barrier of stereotype threat, the threat that others' judgments or their own actions will negatively stereotype them in the domain. Research shows that this threat dramatically depresses the standardized test performance of women and African Americans who are in the academic vanguard of their groups (offering a new interpretation of group differences in standardized test performance), that it causes disidentification with school, and that practices that reduce this threat can reduce these negative effects."
"Increasing vulnerability of plants to a variety of stresses such as drought, salt and extreme temperatures poses a global threat to sustained growth and productivity of major crops. Of these stresses, drought represents a considerable threat to plant growth and development. In view of this, developing staple food cultivars with improved drought tolerance emerges as the most sustainable solution toward improving crop productivity in a scenario of climate change. In parallel, unraveling the genetic architecture and the targeted identification of molecular networks using modern ""OMICS"" analyses, that can underpin drought tolerance mechanisms, is urgently required. Importantly, integrated studies intending to elucidate complex mechanisms can bridge the gap existing in our current knowledge about drought stress tolerance in plants. It is now well established that drought tolerance is regulated by several genes, including transcription factors (TFs) that enable plants to withstand unfavorable conditions, and these remain potential genomic candidates for their wide application in crop breeding. These TFs represent the key molecular switches orchestrating the regulation of plant developmental processes in response to a variety of stresses. The current review aims to offer a deeper understanding of TFs engaged in regulating plant's response under drought stress and to devise potential strategies to improve plant tolerance against drought."
"BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are characterized by elevated, sustained responses to threat, that manifest as threat attention biases. Recent evidence also suggests exaggerated responses to incentives. How these characteristics influence cognitive control is under debate and is the focus of the present study. METHODS: Twenty-five healthy adolescents and 25 adolescents meeting DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder were compared on a task of response inhibition. Inhibitory control was assayed with an antisaccade task that included both incentive (monetary reward) and incidental emotion (facial expression) cues presented prior to the execution of inhibitory behavior. RESULTS: Inhibitory control was enhanced following exposure to threat cues (fear faces) only in adolescent patients, and following exposure to positive cues (happy faces) only in healthy adolescents. Results also revealed a robust performance improvement associated with monetary incentives. This incentive effect did not differ by group. No interaction between incentives and emotional cues was detected. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that biased processing of threat in anxious adolescents affects inhibitory control, perhaps by raising arousal prior to behavioral performance. The absence of normalization of performance in anxious adolescents following exposure to positive emotional cues is a novel finding and will require additional exploration. Future studies will need to more specifically examine how perturbations in positive emotion processes contribute to the symptomatology and the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders."
"The inability to learn an adaptive coping strategy in a novel stressful condition leads to dysfunctional stress coping, a marker of mental disturbances. This study tested the involvement of dorsal striatal dopamine receptors in the dysfunctional coping with the Forced Swim test fostered by a previous experience of reduced food availability. Adult male mice were submitted to a temporary (12 days) reduction of food availability [food-restricted (FR)] or continuously free-fed (FF). Different groups of FF and FR mice were used to evaluate: (1) dorsal striatal mRNA levels of the two isoforms of the dopamine D2 receptor (D2S, D2L). (2) Forced Swim-induced c-fos expression in the dorsal striatum; (3) acquisition and 24 h retention of passive coping with Forced Swim. Additional groups of FF mice were tested for 24 h retention of passive coping acquired during a first experience with Forced Swim immediately followed by intra-striatal infusion of vehicle or two doses of the dopamine D2/D3 receptors antagonist sulpiride or the D1/D5 receptors antagonist SCH23390. Previous restricted feeding selectively reduced mRNA levels of both D2 isoforms and abolished Forced Swim-induced c-fos expression in the left Dorsolateral Striatum and selectively prevented 24 h retention of the coping strategy acquired in a first experience of Forced Swim. Finally, temporary blockade of left Dorsolateral Striatum D2/D3 receptors immediately following the first Forced Swim experience selectively reproduced the behavioral effect of restricted feeding in FF mice. In conclusion, the present results demonstrate that mice previously exposed to a temporary reduction of food availability show low striatal D2 receptors, a known marker of addiction-associated aberrant neuroplasticity, as well as liability to relapse into maladaptive stress coping strategies. Moreover, they offer strong support to a causal relationship between reduction of D2 receptors in the left Dorsolateral Striatum and impaired consolidation of newly acquired adaptive coping."
"Trait anxiety, a stable personality trait associated with increased fear responses to threat, is regarded as a risk factor for the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders. Although the effect of trait anxiety has been examined with regard to explicit threat cues, little is known about the effect of trait anxiety on contextual threat learning. To assess this issue, extreme groups of low and high trait anxiety underwent a contextual fear conditioning protocol using virtual reality. Two virtual office rooms served as the conditioned contexts. One virtual office room (CXT+) was paired with unpredictable electrical stimuli. In the other virtual office room, no electrical stimuli were delivered (CXT-). High-anxious participants tended to show faster acquisition of startle potentiation in the CXT+ versus the CXT- than low-anxious participants. This enhanced contextual fear learning might function as a risk factor for anxiety disorders that are characterized by sustained anxiety."
"Funding for species conservation is insufficient to meet the current challenges facing global biodiversity, yet many programs use expensive single-species recovery actions and neglect broader management that addresses threatening processes. Arid Australia has the world's worst modern mammalian extinction record, largely attributable to competition from introduced herbivores, particularly European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and predation by feral cats (Felis catus) and foxes (Vulpes vulpes). The biological control agent rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) was introduced to Australia in 1995 and resulted in dramatic, widespread rabbit suppression. We compared the area of occupancy and extent of occurrence of 4 extant species of small mammals before and after RHDV outbreak, relative to rainfall, sampling effort, and rabbit and predator populations. Despite low rainfall during the first 14 years after RHDV, 2 native rodents listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the dusky hopping-mouse (Notomys fuscus) and plains mouse (Pseudomys australis), increased their extent of occurrence by 241-365%. A threatened marsupial micropredator, the crest-tailed mulgara (Dasycercus cristicauda), underwent a 70-fold increase in extent of occurrence and a 20-fold increase in area of occupancy. Both bottom-up and top-down trophic effects were attributed to RHDV, namely decreased competition for food resources and declines in rabbit-dependent predators. Based on these sustained increases, these 3 previously threatened species now qualify for threat-category downgrading on the IUCN Red List. These recoveries are on a scale rarely documented in mammals and give impetus to programs aimed at targeted use of RHDV in Australia, rather than simply employing top-down threat-based management of arid ecosystems. Conservation programs that take big-picture approaches to addressing threatening processes over large spatial scales should be prioritized to maximize return from scarce conservation funding. Further, these should be coupled with long-term ecological monitoring, a critical tool in detecting and understanding complex ecosystem change."
"INTRODUCTION: Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile Infection (CDI) is an urgent global threat causing ~500,000 infections annually in the United States of America (USA) and is associated with a 36% 30-day attributable mortality rate. Despite the availability of three therapeutic agents, CDI recurrence occurs in 20-40% of patients, with a 30-40% second recurrence rate in these patients. Consequently, there is a need for novel agents for treating CDI. Areas covered: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov for agents in early stages of clinical development. These drugs include ACX-362E, DS-2969b, LFF 571, RBX2660, ribaxamase, ridinilazole that have advanced to at least phase 2 and several other drugs in phase 1 development. Expert opinion: The challenge for these new agents is three-fold: (1) to have a novel approach such as a different target/mechanism of action; (2) be 'significantly' better than existing agents in regard to 'sustained clinical response'; or (3) be priced at a reasonable cost when it comes to market or perhaps all three. Their utility can only be proven by clinical trials."
"BACKGROUND: Climate-induced coral bleaching poses a major threat to coral reef ecosystems, mostly because of the sensitivities of key habitat-forming corals to increasing temperature. However, susceptibility to bleaching varies greatly among coral genera and there are likely to be major changes in the relative abundance of different corals, even if the wholesale loss of corals does not occur for several decades. Here we document variation in bleaching susceptibility among key genera of reef-building corals in Moorea, French Polynesia, and compare bleaching incidence during mass-bleaching events documented in 1991, 1994, 2002 and 2007. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This study compared the proportion of colonies that bleached for four major genera of reef-building corals (Acropora, Montipora, Pocillopora and Porites), during each of four well-documented bleaching events from 1991 to 2007. Acropora and Montipora consistently bleached in far greater proportions (up to 98%) than Pocillopora and Porites. However, there was an apparent and sustained decline in the proportion of colonies that bleached during successive bleaching events, especially for Acropora and Montipora. In 2007, only 77% of Acropora colonies bleached compared with 98% in 1991. Temporal variation in the proportion of coral colonies bleached may be attributable to differences in environmental conditions among years. Alternately, the sustained declines in bleaching incidence among highly susceptible corals may be indicative of acclimation or adaptation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Coral genera that are highly susceptible to coral bleaching, and especially Acropora and Montipora, exhibit temporal declines in their susceptibility to thermal anomalies at Moorea, French Polynesia. One possible explanation for these findings is that gradual removal of highly susceptible genotypes (through selective mortality of individuals, populations, and/or species) is producing a coral assemblage that is more resistant to sustained and ongoing ocean warming."
"In this study, strategies for serum biomarker assessment were developed for therapeutic monitoring of HCV patients. For this purpose, serum chemokine/cytokine levels were measured by cytometric-bead-array in HCV patients, categorized according to immunotherapy response as: non-responder/NR, relapser/REL and sustained-virologic-responder/SVR. The results demonstrated an overall increase of serum chemokine/cytokine levels in HCV patients. In general, therapeutic failure was associated with presence of a predominant baseline proinflammatory pattern with enhanced CCL5/RANTES, IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma along with decreased IL-10 levels in NR and increased IL-6 and TNF in REL. SVR displayed lower baseline proinflammatory status with decreased CXCL8/IL-8, IL-12 and IL-17 levels. The inability to uphold IFN-alpha levels during immunotherapy was characteristic of NR. Serum chemokine/cytokine signatures further support the deleterious effect of proinflammatory baseline status and the critical role of increased/persistent IFN-alpha levels to guarantee the sustained virologic response. The prominent baseline proinflammatory milieu observed in NR and REL yielded a restricted biomarker network with small number of neighborhood connections, whereas SVR displayed a network with integrated cytokine connectivity. Noteworthy was that SVR presented a shift towards a proinflammatory pattern upon immunotherapy, assuming a pattern similar to that observed in NR and REL at baseline. Moreover, the immunotherapy guided REL towards a profile similar to SVR at baseline. Analysis of baseline-fold changes during treatment pointed out IFN-alpha and TNF as high-performance biomarkers to monitor immunotherapy outcome. This knowledge may contribute for novel insights into the treatment and control of the continuous public health threat posed by HCV infection worldwide."
