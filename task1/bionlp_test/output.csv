"The utility of cognitive therapy (CT) for ambulatory cancer patients is clear but the acute cancer setting significantly shapes the therapeutic interaction, parameters, and delivery of CT. In this article, we describe how to apply CT to acute cancer settings, focusing on how this approach differs from traditionally taught, ambulatory CT. We highlight the importance of a tailored history and formulation, how the cognitive model is applied within an acute cancer context to promote coping and adaptation. Reframing must consider the ""grain of truth"" to many so-called distorted cognitions, such as ""cancer means death."" Fear of recurrence is an example of a common reframing challenge. Another is the ""tyranny of positive thinking."" Here there is avoidance of considering negative outcomes such as death; patients are told to ""think positive,"" leaving them alone at a time of life-threatening crisis. Instead, acute cancer CT utilizes a stance of realistic optimism. Empathy plays a vital role in turning off the bracing reaction to threat and facilitating problem-solving. Successfully combining CT with medications is integral to this model. We also discuss how CT can be applied to discussing prognosis, the desire for hastened death and suicidality, as well as death and dying in general. Because of the ubiquitous nature of cancer, most cognitive therapists will encounter patients with cancer in their practices. Acute cancer CT is a skill set that should be widely taught to cognitive therapists and flagged as a priority for academic programs and professional organizations."
"Pain is essential for avoidance of tissue damage and for promotion of healing. Notwithstanding the survival value, pain brings about emotional suffering reflected in fear and anxiety, which in turn augment pain thus giving rise to a self-sustaining feedforward loop. Given such reciprocal relationships, the present article uses neuroscientific conceptualizations of fear and anxiety as a theoretical framework for hitherto insufficiently understood pathophysiological mechanisms underlying chronic pain. To that end, searches of PubMed-indexed journals were performed using the following Medical Subject Headings' terms: pain and nociception plus amygdala, anxiety, cognitive, fear, sensory, and unconscious. Recursive sets of scientific and clinical evidence extracted from this literature review were summarized within the following key areas: (1) parallelism between acute pain and fear and between chronic pain and anxiety; (2) all are related to the evasion of sensory-perceived threats and are subserved by subcortical circuits mediating automatic threat-induced physiologic responses and defensive actions in conjunction with higher order corticolimbic networks (e.g., thalamocortical, thalamo-striato-cortical and amygdalo-cortical) generating conscious representations and valuation-based adaptive behaviors; (3) some instances of chronic pain and anxiety conditions are driven by the failure to diminish or block respective nociceptive information or unconscious treats from reaching conscious awareness; and (4) the neural correlates of pain-related conscious states and cognitions may become autonomous (i.e., dissociated) from the subcortical activity/function leading to the eventual chronicity. Identifying relative contributions of the diverse neuroanatomical sources, thus, offers prospects for the development of novel preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies in chronic pain patients."
"The purpose of this study was to identify the predictors of compliance shown by adolescents with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). Three hundred individuals aged 13-17 years were randomly selected from the Finnish Social Insurance Institution's register. The questionnaires were sent to the adolescents selected from the register to be returned directly to the researcher in a self-addressed envelope. Ninety-one per cent (n = 274) returned the questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to find the factors that predicted compliance with health regimens. The compliance of adolescents with JRA was predicted on the basis of motivation, fear of acute problems, support from nurses, energy and willpower, and threat to social well-being. The most powerful predictor was motivation. The likelihood of the adolescents who had good motivation to comply with health regimens was 29.13-fold compared to the adolescents who did not have good motivation. The next powerful predictor was fear of acute problems. The adolescents who felt fear of acute problems complied with health regimens with a 20.35-fold likelihood compared to the adolescents who did not have fears. The third powerful predictor was support from nurses. The likelihood of adolescents supported by nurse to comply with health regimens was 17.03-fold compared to the adolescents who did not receive support from nurses. The likelihood of adolescents who had energy and willpower to comply with health regimens was 7.56-fold compared to the adolescents who did not have energy and willpower. Also, the threat to social well-being predicted good compliance."
"This study examines the psychological impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 195 adult patients in Hong Kong. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were administered to patients 1 month after their discharge. Of the participants 10% to 18% reported symptoms related to posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression. Symptom severity was associated with high perceived life threat and low emotional support. Women and participants who had low education level were more likely to have symptoms of avoidance. Participants who personally knew someone who had SARS were more likely to be affected by depressive symptoms."
"Stress-related disorders, e.g., anxiety and depression, are characterized by decreased top-down control for distracting information, as well as a memory bias for threatening information. However, it is unclear how acute stress biases mnemonic encoding and leads to prioritized storage of threat-related information even if outside the focus of attention. In the current study, healthy adults (N=53, all male) were randomly assigned to stress induction using the socially evaluated cold-pressor test (SECPT) or a control condition. Participants performed a task in which they were required to identify a target letter within a string of letters that were either identical to the target and thereby facilitating detection (low distractor load) or mixed with other letters to complicate the search (high load). Either a fearful or neutral face was presented on the background, outside the focus of attention. Twenty-four hours later, participants were asked to perform a surprise recognition memory test for those background faces. Stress induction resulted in increased cortisol and negative subjective mood ratings. Stress did not affect visual search performance, however, participants in the stress group showed stronger memory compared to the control group for fearful faces in the low attentional load condition. Critically, the stress induced memory bias was accompanied by decoupling between amygdala and DLFPC during encoding, which may represent a mechanism for decreased ability to filter task-irrelevant threatening background information. The current study provides a potential neural account for how stress can produce a negative memory bias for threatening information even if presented outside the focus of attention. Despite of an adaptive advantage for survival, such tendencies may ultimately also lead to generalized fear, a possibility requiring additional investigation."
"Pain catastrophizing has shown to predict avoidance behavior in acute and chronic pain, but the literature is inconsistent. The present study tested the hypothesis that current mood and threat context moderate the relationship between pain catastrophizing and performance duration. Affective-motivational models postulate that negative and positive moods provide information about whether an activity is respectively threatening or safe. Moreover, it has been proposed that stable cognitive schemas about threat influence behavior particularly in threat-relevant contexts. The present study aimed to establish whether pain catastrophizing is related to less or greater performance duration, when participants experience respectively negative or positive moods, particularly in a high threatening pain context. A 2 mood x 2 threat context between-subjects factorial design was applied in 89 healthy participants with pain catastrophizing as covariate and performance duration during a painful finger pressing task as dependent variables. As predicted, higher pain catastrophizing was associated with less performance duration when participants experienced negative moods. The opposite was found when participants experienced positive moods. Moreover, these relationships were most pronounced in a high threatening pain context. This study suggests that the relationship between pain catastrophizing and performance duration during painful activities is moderated by situational factors such as current mood and threat context."
"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the effects of fear of pain (FOP) and threat on attentional biases, using eye-tracking methods. METHOD: One hundred and seven undergraduate students were randomized to receive threatening or reassuring information about the cold pressor task; and divided into high and low FOP groups. Participants completed the dot-probe task, while their eye movements were tracked. RESULTS: Results showed that those who received threatening information were less likely to have their first fixation on pain words, particularly affective pain words. Furthermore, under conditions of high threat, the high FOP group who did fixate on affective pain words, fixated more quickly than for sensory pain words, whereas the opposite was the case under low threat. In regression analyses, initial vigilance towards affective pain words was a significant predictor of reporting pain more quickly on the cold pressor. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that initial vigilance of affective pain stimuli predicts actual hypervigilance to an acute experimental pain task. However, under conditions of high threat, participants show evidence of avoidance of affective pain words, even though when they do fixate on these stimuli, the high FOP group does so more quickly. These results confirm that attentional processes, characterized by vigilance avoidance, appear important. SIGNIFICANCE: Interventions that change attention towards pain to reduce vigilance and subsequent avoidance may be indicated to improve pain outcomes."
"OBJECTIVE: Numerous studies have shown that level of exposure to combat-related stressors is a robust risk factor for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression among military personnel deployed to a warzone. Threat perception of warzone experiences assessed retrospectively has been consistently linked to increased risk for PTSD and depression months or even years after returning from deployment. However, little is known about concurrent relations between perceived threat, deployment stress, and stress-related symptoms during deployment. Using a novel in-theater web-based assessment system, we investigated the unique and joint contribution of threat perception and deployment stressors in predicting the emergence of PTSD and depression symptoms during deployment. METHOD: Soldiers (N = 150) completed assessments of deployment stressors, perceived threat, PTSD symptoms, and depression symptoms throughout deployment to Iraq. RESULTS: Results revealed that perceived threat potentiated the increase in PTSD symptoms as a result of increases in deployment stressors. In contrast, perceived threat, but not warzone stressors, uniquely predicted depression symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the important role of threat perception as a risk marker for the acute experience of depression and PTSD symptoms during deployment. (PsycINFO Database Record"
"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of mindfulness training in comparison with relaxation training on pain, threshold and tolerance during the cold pressor task. METHODS: Undergraduate psychology students (n = 140) were randomly assigned to receive reassuring or threatening information about the cold pressor. Participants were then re-randomized to receive mindfulness or a control intervention: relaxation training. RESULTS: Analyses confirmed that the threat manipulation was effective in increasing worry, fear of harm and expectations of pain, and reducing coping efficacy. Interaction effects revealed that mindfulness was effective in increasing curiosity and reducing decentring under conditions of high threat but not low threat. Other interactions on cognitive variables (attentional bias to pain and self-focus) confirmed that mindfulness and relaxation appeared to exert influences under different conditions (i.e. mindfulness: high threat; and relaxation: low threat). Despite these cognitive effects being discerned under different conditions, there were no differences between mindfulness and relaxation on pain, tolerance or threshold in either threat group. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a single, brief session of mindfulness based on body scanning is not sufficient to change the way in which individuals approach an experimental pain task in comparison with relaxation, which has previously been shown to be ineffective."
"BACKGROUND: Individual differences in mindfulness have been associated with numerous self-report indicators of stress, but research has not examined how mindfulness may buffer neuroendocrine and psychological stress responses under controlled laboratory conditions. The present study investigated the role of trait mindfulness in buffering cortisol and affective responses to a social evaluative stress challenge versus a control task. METHODS: Participants completed measures of trait mindfulness, perceived stress, anxiety, and fear of negative evaluation before being randomized to complete the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST; Kirschbaum et al., 1993) or a control task. At points throughout the session, participants provided five saliva samples to assess cortisol response patterns, and completed four self-report measures of anxiety and negative affect to assess psychological responses. RESULTS: In accord with hypotheses, higher trait mindfulness predicted lower cortisol responses to the TSST, relative to the control task, as well as lower anxiety and negative affect. These relations remained significant when controlling for the role of other variables that predicted cortisol and affective responses. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that trait mindfulness modulates cortisol and affective responses to an acute social stressor. Further research is needed to understand the neural pathways through which mindfulness impacts these responses."
"Changes in cortisol and shame are commonly elicited by psychosocial stressors involving social-evaluative threat. According to social self preservation theory, this coordinated psychobiological response is adaptive. Individuals with a history of depression, however, may exhibit diminished cortisol reactivity to acute stressors, which could interfere with coordinated cortisol and shame responses. The present study examined temporal relations between cortisol and shame responses to a psychosocial stress task in young adults who varied in their history of depression (56 remitted-depressed, 46 never-depressed). Lagged effects multilevel models revealed that depression history moderated relations between cortisol levels and shame ratings 25-55min later. The pattern of these interactions was similar: whereas higher cortisol levels predicted increases in shame in never-depressed individuals, cortisol levels were unrelated to shame responses in remitted-depressed individuals. Findings suggest a dissociation between cortisol and shame responses to stress in individuals with a history of depression."
"This article reviews the existing evolutionary perspectives on the acute stress response habitual faintness and blood-injection-injury type-specific phobia (BIITS phobia). In this article, an alternative evolutionary perspective, based on recent advances in evolutionary psychology, is proposed. Specifically, that fear-induced faintness (eg, fainting following the sight of a syringe, blood, or following a trivial skin injury) is a distinct Homo sapiens-specific extreme-stress survival response to an inescapable threat. The article suggests that faintness evolved in response to middle paleolithic intra-group and inter-group violence (of con-specifics) rather than as a pan-mammalian defense response, as is presently assumed. Based on recent literature, freeze, flight, fight, fright, faint provides a more complete description of the human acute stress response sequence than current descriptions. Faintness, one of three primary physiological reactions involved in BIITS phobia, is extremely rare in other phobias. Since heritability estimates are higher for faintness than for fears or phobias, the author suggests that trait-faintness may be a useful complement to trait-anxiety as an endophenotype in research on the human fear circuitry. Some implications for the forthcoming Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition as well as for clinical, health services, and transcriptomic research are briefly discussed."
"The DSM-III, DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 have judiciously minimized discussion of etiologies to distance clinical psychiatry from Freudian psychoanalysis. With this goal mostly achieved, discussion of etiological factors should be reintroduced into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V). A research agenda for the DSM-V advocated the ""development of a pathophysiologically based classification system"". The author critically reviews the neuroevolutionary literature on stress-induced and fear circuitry disorders and related amygdala-driven, species-atypical fear behaviors of clinical severity in adult humans. Over 30 empirically testable/falsifiable predictions are presented. It is noted that in DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10, the classification of stress and fear circuitry disorders is neither mode-of-acquisition-based nor brain-evolution-based. For example, snake phobia (innate) and dog phobia (overconsolidational) are clustered together. Similarly, research on blood-injection-injury-type-specific phobia clusters two fears different in their innateness: 1) an arguably ontogenetic memory-trace-overconsolidation-based fear (hospital phobia) and 2) a hardwired (innate) fear of the sight of one's blood or a sharp object penetrating one's skin. Genetic architecture-charting of fear-circuitry-related traits has been challenging. Various, non-phenotype-based architectures can serve as targets for research. In this article, the author will propose one such alternative genetic architecture. This article was inspired by the following: A) Nesse's ""Smoke-Detector Principle"", B) the increasing suspicion that the ""smooth"" rather than ""lumpy"" distribution of complex psychiatric phenotypes (including fear-circuitry disorders) may in some cases be accounted for by oligogenic (and not necessarily polygenic) transmission, and C) insights from the initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome by the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium published in late 2005. Neuroevolutionary insights relevant to fear circuitry symptoms that primarily emerge overconsolidationally (especially Combat related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) are presented. Also introduced is a human-evolution-based principle for clustering innate fear traits. The ""Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle"" of innate fears proposed in this article may be useful in the development of a neuroevolution-based taxonomic re-clustering of stress-triggered and fear-circuitry disorders in DSM-V. Four broad clusters of evolved fear circuits are proposed based on their time-depths: 1) Mesozoic (mammalian-wide) circuits hardwired by wild-type alleles driven to fixation by Mesozoic selective sweeps; 2) Cenozoic (simian-wide) circuits relevant to many specific phobias; 3) mid Paleolithic and upper Paleolithic (Homo sapiens-specific) circuits (arguably resulting mostly from mate-choice-driven stabilizing selection); 4) Neolithic circuits (arguably mostly related to stabilizing selection driven by gene-culture co-evolution). More importantly, the author presents evolutionary perspectives on warzone-related PTSD, Combat-Stress Reaction, Combat-related Stress, Operational-Stress, and other deployment-stress-induced symptoms. The Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle presented in this article may help explain the dissimilar stress-resilience levels following different types of acute threat to survival of oneself or one's progency (aka DSM-III and DSM-V PTSD Criterion-A events). PTSD rates following exposure to lethal inter-group violence (combat, warzone exposure or intentionally caused disasters such as terrorism) are usually 5-10 times higher than rates following large-scale natural disasters such as forest fires, floods, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes. The author predicts that both intentionally-caused large-scale bioevent-disasters, as well as natural bioevents such as SARS and avian flu pandemics will be an exception and are likely to be followed by PTSD rates approaching those that follow warzone exposure. During bioevents, Amygdala-driven and locus-coeruleus-driven epidemic pseudosomatic symptoms may be an order of magnitude more common than infection-caused cytokine-driven symptoms. Implications for the red cross and FEMA are discussed. It is also argued that hospital phobia as well as dog phobia, bird phobia and bat phobia require re-taxonomization in DSM-V in a new ""overconsolidational disorders"" category anchored around PTSD. The overconsolidational spectrum category may be conceptualized as straddling the fear circuitry spectrum disorders and the affective spectrum disorders categories, and may be a category for which Pitman's secondary prevention propranolol regimen may be specifically indicated as a ""morning after pill"" intervention. Predictions are presented regarding obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (e.g., female-pattern hoarding vs. male-pattern hoarding) and ""culture-bound"" acute anxiety symptoms (taijin-kyofusho, koro, shuk yang, shook yong, suo yang, rok-joo, jinjinia-bemar, karoshi, gwarosa, Voodoo death). Also discussed are insights relevant to pseudoneurological symptoms and to the forthcoming Dissociative-Conversive disorders category in DSM-V, including what the author terms fright-triggered acute pseudo-localized symptoms (i.e., pseudoparalysis, pseudocerebellar imbalance, psychogenic blindness, pseudoseizures, and epidemic sociogenic illness). Speculations based on studies of the human abnormal-spindle-like, microcephaly-associated (ASPM) gene, the microcephaly primary autosomal recessive (MCPH) gene, and the forkhead box p2 (FOXP2) gene are made and incorporated into what is termed ""The pre-FOXP2 Hypothesis of Blood-Injection-Injury Phobia."" Finally, the author argues for a non-reductionistic fusion of ""distal (evolutionary) neurobiology"" with clinical ""proximal neurobiology,"" utilizing neurological heuristics. It is noted that the value of re-clustering fear traits based on behavioral ethology, human-phylogenomics-derived endophenotypes and on ontogenomics (gene-environment interactions) can be confirmed or disconfirmed using epidemiological or twin studies and psychiatric genomics."
"Fear and anxiety are conceptualized as responses to acute or potential threat, respectively. Adult twin studies found substantial interplay between genetic and environmental factors influencing fear disorders (phobias) and anxiety disorders. Research in children, however, has largely examined these factors independently. Thus, there exists a substantial knowledge gap regarding the underlying etiologic structure of these closely-related constructs during development. Symptom counts for five fear (criticism, the unknown, death, animal, medical) and four anxiety (generalized, panic, separation, social) dimensions were obtained for 373 twin pairs ages 9-14. Multivariate twin modeling was performed to elucidate the genetic and environmental influences distributed amongst these dimensions. The best fitting model contained one genetic, two familial environmental, and two unique environmental factors shared between fear and anxiety symptoms plus dimension-specific genetic and unique environmental factors. Although several environmental factors were shared between fear and anxiety dimensions, one latent factor accounted for genetic influences across both domains. While adult studies find somewhat distinct etiological differences between anxiety and phobic disorders, the current results suggest that their relative genetic and environmental influences are not as clearly demarcated in children. These etiological distinctions are more nuanced, likely contributing to the highly diffuse symptom patterns seen during development."
"BACKGROUND: To study the potentially avoidable decision-making delay in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) adults male with different psychological characteristics a nationwide multicentre study was conducted in Italy by the 118 Coronary Care Units (CCUs). METHOD: 929 AMI patients consecutively presented to the CCU in a conscious condition less than two hours, 2-6 hours, 6-12 hours, and more than 12 hours after symptom onset and completing the Disease Distress Questionnaire (DDQ) were enrolled in a multicentre case-control study. The DDQ collects information regarding the decision time to seek help, and includes a set of items assessing psychological factors and pain-related symptoms. The relationship between the perceived threat and the delay due to decision-making was evaluated by means of a multivariate model using LISREL 8 structural equation modelling. RESULTS: The delay significantly correlated with perceived threat, which was mainly related to somatic awareness. It was only slightly related to pain and was not associated with any of the other variables. Perceived threat was also related to psychological upset, fear and health worries, the first of which was considerably influenced by emotional instability. CONCLUSION: Somatic awareness is the main dimension affecting perceived threat, but subjective pain intensity affects the delay both directly and indirectly. The core of the model is the relationship between perceived threat and the delay due to decision-making. The importance of subjective pain intensity is well documented, but it is still not clear how subjective and objective pain interact."
"This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of implicit attention re-training (AR) on pain ratings, threshold and tolerance during the cold-pressor task and to determine whether the effectiveness of AR was affected by threat expectancy. One hundred and four undergraduate psychology students were randomly assigned to receive either threat-alleviating or threat-inducing information about the task. Participants were then re-randomized to receive an AR that either trained them to implicitly attend to neutral and ignore pain-related stimuli (neutral training) or to attend towards pain-related stimuli (pain training). Hence, the present study had a 2 (threat expectancy: high vs low) x 2 (AR: pain vs neutral) design. Manipulation checks confirmed that the threat manipulation was effective in increasing threat expectancy and the training paradigm shifted attentional biases in predicted directions. Results showed that, relative to neutral re-training, those in the pain re-training group reported higher levels of pain 30s into the cold pressor task and registered pain more quickly. There was no difference in tolerance between the groups, nor pain at tolerance. This was the same pattern of results found for the threat induction. For initial pain ratings, there was an interaction that closely approached significance (p=0.053). These results show that AR affects individual's perceptions of and their responses to pain during an experimental task in a similar way to increasing the threat expectancy of the task. Future research should trial AR in real-life settings to determine whether these results can be generalized."
"Nicotine elicits several behavioural effects on mood as well as on stress and anxiety processes. Recently, it was found that the higher order components of the sensory cortex, such as the secondary auditory cortex Te2, are essential for the long-term storage of remote fear memories. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effects of acute nicotine injection into the higher order auditory cortex Te2, on the remote emotional memories of either threat or incentive experiences in rats. We found that intra-Te2 nicotine injection decreased the fear-evoked responses to a tone previously paired with footshock. This effect was cue- and dose-specific and was not due to any interference with auditory stimuli processing, innate anxiety and fear processes, or with motor responses. Nicotine acts acutely in the presence of threat stimuli but it did not determine the permanent degradation of the fear-memory trace, since memories tested one week after nicotine injection were unaffected. Remarkably, nicotine did not affect the memory of a similar tone that was paired to incentive stimuli. We conclude from our results that nicotine, when acting acutely in the auditory cortex, relieves the fear charge embedded by learned stimuli."
"BACKGROUND: The increasing numbers of leukemia cancer survivors treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) face numerous challenges after their transplant procedure. Little information has been published regarding the coping process of this population. Understanding how they cope with this life-threatening disease can assist healthcare professionals to provide holistic care. PURPOSE: This study was designed to elicit the coping process of adults experiencing acute leukemia who underwent HSCT therapy. METHODS: This longitudinal qualitative study and grounded theory took place during 2009-2011. Ten adults with acute leukemia scheduled for HSCT were recruited from Shariati Hospital in Tehran, Iran. A series of pretransplant and posttransplant interviews were held in the hospital's HSCT units. Final interviews took place 2-6 months posttransplant in the hospital's outpatient clinic. RESULTS: The five categories that emerged from the data included perceived threat, suspension between fear and hope, rebirth, contextual factors, and coping strategies. Although patients vacillated within the coping spectrum (i.e., the ""buffer zone"" between fighting and acquiescing), ""finding meaning"" was identified as the final outcome of their experience that indicated effective coping. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE: Each patient perceives leukemia and HSCT therapy uniquely. This life-threatening disease can significantly affect patient perception and change patient lives both temporarily and permanently. Nurses can apply effective interventions to help patients cope with their unique situation, find meaning and hope, and allay fear and stress."
"UNLABELLED: Attentional biases towards pain-related words of chronic and acute low back pain (LBP) patients were compared with healthy pain-free controls. Specifically, the aims were to determine: 1) whether chronic LBP patients demonstrate attentional biases compared to pain-free controls; 2) whether observed biases are also present in those with acute LBP; and 3) whether observed biases are associated with pain-related fear among the pain groups. Four groups were recruited: 1) acute LBP patients; 2) chronic LBP patients from physiotherapy practices; 3) chronic LBP patients from a tertiary referral pain-management center; and 4) healthy pain-free controls. Participants were assessed on the dot-probe computer task for attentional bias to pain-related words. All 3 pain groups demonstrated biases compared to controls on sensory but not on affective, disability, or threat words. Among the pain groups, those with low and moderate levels of fear of (re)injury demonstrated biases towards sensory pain words that were absent in those with high levels of fear, which is counterintuitive to what the fear of (re)injury model suggests. These results suggest that the experience of pain, rather than duration, is the primary indicator of the presence of pain-related biases. PERSPECTIVE: Attentional biases are present in chronic and acute pain. Biases towards sensory-pain stimuli were demonstrated regardless of pain duration; however, they were present in those with low and moderate levels of fear of (re)injury only and not those high in fear. These findings are not consistent with the fear of (re)injury model."
"BACKGROUND: The difficulty in treating mood disorders has brought about clinical interest in alternative treatments, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). However, the optimal parameters for stimulation and underlying mechanisms of action are unclear. Psychiatric treatments have acute effects on emotional processing that predict later therapeutic action. Such effects have been proposed as cognitive biomarkers for screening novel treatments for depression and anxiety. METHODS: This study assessed the effect of tDCS on a battery of emotional processing measures sensitive to antidepressant action. To refine optimal stimulation parameters, DLPFC stimulation using two common electrode montages was compared with sham. Sixty healthy volunteers received 20 minutes of active or sham DLPFC stimulation before completing computerized emotional processing tasks, including a dot-probe measure of vigilance to threat. RESULTS: Relative to sham stimulation, participants receiving simultaneous anodal stimulation of left DLPFC and cathodal stimulation of right DLPFC (bipolar-balanced montage) showed reduced vigilance to threatening stimuli. There was no such significant effect when the cathode was placed on the supraorbital ridge (bipolar-unbalanced montage). There were no effects of tDCS on other measures of emotional processing. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide the first experimental evidence that modulating activity in the DLPFC reduces vigilance to threatening stimuli. This significant reduction in fear vigilance is similar to that seen with anxiolytic treatments in the same cognitive paradigm. The finding that DLPFC tDCS acutely alters the processing of threatening information suggests a potential cognitive mechanism that could underwrite treatment effects in clinical populations."
"Research confirms that patients with chronic pain show a tendency to interpret ambiguous stimuli as pain related. However, whether modifying these interpretive pain biases impacts pain outcomes is unknown. This study aimed to demonstrate that interpretation biases towards pain can be modified, and that changing these biases influences pain outcomes in the cold pressor task. One hundred and six undergraduate students were randomly allocated to receive either threatening or reassuring information regarding the cold pressor. They also were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 conditions in the Ambiguous Scenarios Task, in which they were trained to have either a threatening interpretation of pain (pain bias condition) or a nonthreatening interpretation of pain (no pain bias condition). Therefore, the study had a 2 (threat/reassuring)x2 (pain bias/no pain bias) design. Analyses showed that a bias was induced contingent on condition, and that the threat manipulation was effective. Participants in the pain bias condition hesitated more before doing the cold pressor task than those in the no pain bias condition, as did those in the threat compared with the reassurance condition. The major finding was that interpretive bias mediated the relationship between bias condition and hesitance time, supporting the causal role of interpretive biases for avoidance behaviors in current chronic pain models. No differences were found on other pain outcomes regarding bias or threat, and the efficacy of the bias modification was not impacted by different levels of threat. These results suggest that cognitive bias modification should be further explored as a potential intervention in pain."
"Background and aims Interpreting pain- and illness-related stimuli as health-threatening is common among chronic pain patients but also occurs in the general population. As interpretation bias (IB) may affect pain perception and might even play part in the development and maintenance of chronic pain, it is important to improve our understanding of this concept. Several studies suggest an association between IB and pain-related anxiety. However, those studies often rely on verbal and pictorial IB tasks that do not entail a threat of actual pain, therefore lacking personal relevance for healthy participants. The current study investigated whether healthy individuals show an IB towards ambiguous health-related stimuli in a context of actual pain threat, and explored whether this bias is associated to pain anxiety constructs. Methods Thirty-six healthy participants were conditioned to expect painful electrocutaneous shocks (unconditioned stimulus - US) after health-threat words (CS+) but not after neutral (non-health-threat) words (CS-) in order to establish fear of pain. Subsequently, they completed a verbal interpretation task that contained new CS+ and CS- stimuli as well as ambiguous non-reinforced health-threat and non-health-threat words. IB was assessed through shock expectancy ratings and startle responses to ambiguous and evident health threatening or neutral word stimuli. Pain-related anxiety was measured with validated questionnaires. Results The results show a general IB towards ambiguous health-related words on pain expectancies but not on startle response. An exploratory analysis suggests that this effect exists irrespective of pain-related anxiety levels which however may be due to a lack of power. Conclusion We present a novel experimental paradigm employing actual health threat that captures IB towards health-related stimuli in healthy individuals. Taken together, results provide evidence for the further consideration of IB as a latent vulnerability factor in the onset and maintenance of pain chronicity. In contrast to previous studies employing a safe, pain-free context, we found that healthy participants show an IB towards ambiguous health-related stimuli, when confronted with pain threat. Implications Like chronic pain patients, healthy individuals display an IB towards health-threat stimuli when these stimuli become personally relevant by carrying information about pending health threat. Therefore, the presented paradigm could be valuable for pain-related cognitive bias research in healthy participants as it may have a higher ecological validity than previous study designs. Future studies will have to elucidate the influence of anxiety constructs on IB in larger samples."
"OBJECTIVES: Studies concentrating on the temporal dependence of subjective concepts during oncological treatment are underrepresented. Subjective interpretation contexts develop in the course of illness. The study focuses on the ideal-typical gestalt of these contents. METHODS: In a follow-up study on coping, 12 patients with acute leukaemia (AL) were interviewed using a semistructured interview at the end of initial inpatient treatment. Using qualitative methodology, we inductively developed categories and assigned them to formal main categories. RESULTS: The following categories were developed: causal uncertainty as burden; discrepancy between subjective and objective assessment of degree of threat; knowledge of disease: conflict between information-seeking and information-avoiding behavior; dominance of medical approach to treatment; pursuit of normality; defense of emotions; orientation to workflows on the ward; adjustment as a coping strategy; positive attitude as a resource; life between hope and fear; limited future; latent fear of death. CONCLUSION: Themes of coping with the disease become visible. Some of these contents are tacit and latent, although of high subjective relevance to the patient. Their consideration could improve the patient-physician relationship."
"BACKGROUND: Intrusive re-experiencing in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) comprises distressing sensory impressions from the trauma that seem to occur 'out of the blue'. A key question is how intrusions are triggered. One possibility is that PTSD is characterized by a processing advantage for stimuli that resemble those that accompanied the trauma, which would lead to increased detection of such cues in the environment. METHOD: We used a blurred picture identification task in a cross-sectional (n=99) and a prospective study (n=221) of trauma survivors. RESULTS: Participants with acute stress disorder (ASD) or PTSD, but not trauma survivors without these disorders, identified trauma-related pictures, but not general threat pictures, better than neutral pictures. There were no group differences in the rate of trauma-related answers to other picture categories. The relative processing advantage for trauma-related pictures correlated with re-experiencing and dissociation, and predicted PTSD at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: A perceptual processing bias for trauma-related stimuli may contribute to the involuntary triggering of intrusive trauma memories in PTSD."
"Aggregation is a defensive strategy employed by many prey species in response to predatory threat. Our group has characterized defensive aggregation (huddling) in Rattus norvegicus in response to a ball of cat fur. In this situation some rats huddle less, and approach the threatening cue more than others (active vs. passive responders). The present study explored whether active responding is a stable phenotype associated with behaviors outside direct predatory encounters. The neural substrates of active and passive responding under predatory threat were explored using c-Fos immunohistochemistry. Finally, we examined whether the presence of conspecifics during predatory threat biases behavior towards active responding. Active and passive responding styles were found to be stable in individual rats across consecutive group exposures to cat fur, and were predicted by anxiety-like behavior in an open-field emergence test. Active responders displayed less conditioned fear in an environment associated with predatory threat, and had higher post-exposure intake of a weak sucrose solution (a test of ""anhedonia""). Active responding was associated with: greater cat fur-induced activation of the accessory olfactory bulb, reflecting greater olfactory stimulation in rats actively approaching the fur; lowered activation of somatosensory cortex, reflecting reduced huddling with conspecifics; and reduced activation in the lateral septum. Social exposure to cat fur promoted active responding relative to individual exposure, and lowered c-Fos expression in the dorsomedial periaqueductal grey, medial caudate putamen and lateral habenula. We conclude that individual differences in anti-predator behavior appear stable traits with active responders having a more resilient phenotype. Social exposure to predatory threat has an acute buffering effect, subtly changing the neural and behavioral response towards threat and encouraging active responding. An association between active responding and lower c-Fos expression in the lateral septum is consistent with previous studies that highlight this region as an important neurobiological substrate of defensive aggregation."
"Increasing evidence suggests that pain-related fear is key to the transition from acute to chronic pain. Previous research has shown that perceptual similarity with a pain-associated movement fosters the generalization of fear to novel movements. Perceptual generalization of pain-related fear is adaptive as it enables individuals to extrapolate the threat value of one movement to another without the necessity to learn anew. However, excessive spreading of fear to safe movements may become maladaptive and may lead to sustained anxiety, dysfunctional avoidance behaviors, and severe disability. A hallmark of human cognition is the ability to extract conceptual knowledge from a learning episode as well. Although this conceptual pathway may be important to understand fear generalization in chronic pain, research on this topic is lacking. We investigated acquisition and generalization of concept-based pain-related fear. During acquisition, unique exemplars of one action category (CS+; e.g., opening boxes) were followed by pain, whereas exemplars of another action category (CS-; e.g., closing boxes) were not. Subsequently, spreading of pain-related fear to novel exemplars of both action categories was tested. Participants learned to expect the pain to occur and reported more pain-related fear to the exemplars of the CS+ category compared with those of the CS- category. During generalization, fear and expectancy generalized to novel exemplars of the CS+ category, but not to the CS- category. This pattern was not corroborated in the eyeblink startle measures. This is the first study that demonstrates that pain-related fear can be acquired and generalized based on conceptual knowledge."
"Fear learning and regulation is a prominent model for describing the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders and stress-related psychopathology. Fear expression can be modulated using a number of regulatory strategies, including extinction, cognitive emotion regulation, avoidance strategies and reconsolidation. In this review, we examine research investigating the effects of acute stress and stress hormones on these regulatory techniques. We focus on what is known about the impact of stress on the ability to flexibly regulate fear responses that are acquired through Pavlovian fear conditioning. Our primary aim is to explore the impact of stress on fear regulation in humans. Given this, we focus on techniques where stress has been linked to alterations of fear regulation in humans (extinction and emotion regulation), and briefly discuss other techniques (avoidance and reconsolidation) where the impact of stress or stress hormones have been mainly explored in animal models. These investigations reveal that acute stress may impair the persistent inhibition of fear, presumably by altering prefrontal cortex function. Characterizing the effects of stress on fear regulation is critical for understanding the boundaries within which existing regulation strategies are viable in everyday life and can better inform treatment options for those who suffer from anxiety and stress-related psychopathology."
"According to Edmondson's Enduring Somatic Threat (EST) Model of PTSD Due to Acute Life-Threatening Medical Events, the nature of PTSD in the context of illness may differ from the nature of ""traditional"" PTSD in that it includes future-oriented alongside past-related intrusive thoughts. Yet almost no empirical studies to date have assessed the putative future-oriented quality of cardiac-disease-induced PTSD (CDI-PTSD). In the current study, we assessed the hypothesized associations between CDI-PTSD and fear of illness progression (FoP) - a novel theoretical conceptualization of patients' future-related anxieties. We hypothesized that FoP would be positively associated with CDI-PTSD, and especially with its specific items of intrusive thoughts. Patients (N=112) were interviewed three months post-hospitalization for an acute coronary event via use of the PSS-SR-5 (to assess PTSD symptomatology), the FoP-Q-SF (to assess fear of illness progression), and the HADS (to assess anxiety and depression levels). Results indicated a strong positive association between CDI-PTSD and FoP, even when controlling for anxiety and depression. As hypothesized, the concepts of CDI-PTSD and fear of illness progression were strongly associated both at the level of the clusters as well as at the level of the specific items. The current study provides an initial empirical validation of the EST Model, especially regarding the future-oriented nature of PTSD resulting from acute cardiovascular disease."
"BACKGROUND: Anxious hypervigilance is marked by sensitized sensory-perceptual processes and attentional biases to potential danger cues in the environment. How this is realized at the neurocomputational level is unknown but could clarify the brain mechanisms disrupted in psychiatric conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder. Predictive coding, instantiated by dynamic causal models, provides a promising framework to ground these state-related changes in the dynamic interactions of reciprocally connected brain areas. METHODS: Anxiety states were elicited in healthy participants (n = 19) by exposure to the threat of unpredictable, aversive shocks while undergoing magnetoencephalography. An auditory oddball sequence was presented to measure cortical responses related to deviance detection, and dynamic causal models quantified deviance-related changes in effective connectivity. Participants were also administered alprazolam (double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover) to determine whether the cortical effects of threat-induced anxiety are reversed by acute anxiolytic treatment. RESULTS: Deviant tones elicited increased auditory cortical responses under threat. Bayesian analyses revealed that hypervigilant responding was best explained by increased postsynaptic gain in primary auditory cortex activity as well as modulation of feedforward, but not feedback, coupling within a temporofrontal cortical network. Increasing inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acidergic action with alprazolam reduced anxiety and restored feedback modulation within the network. CONCLUSIONS: Threat-induced anxiety produced unbalanced feedforward signaling in response to deviations in predicable sensory input. Amplifying ascending sensory prediction error signals may optimize stimulus detection in the face of impending threats. At the same time, diminished descending sensory prediction signals impede perceptual learning and may, therefore, underpin some of the deleterious effects of anxiety on higher-order cognition."
"How fear is represented in the brain has generated a lot of research attention, not only because fear increases the chances for survival when appropriately expressed but also because it can lead to anxiety and stress-related disorders when inadequately processed. In this review, we summarize recent progress in the understanding of the neural circuits processing innate fear in rodents. We propose that these circuits are contained within three main functional units in the brain: a detection unit, responsible for gathering sensory information signaling the presence of a threat; an integration unit, responsible for incorporating the various sensory information and recruiting downstream effectors; and an output unit, in charge of initiating appropriate bodily and behavioral responses to the threatful stimulus. In parallel, the experience of innate fear also instructs a learning process leading to the memorization of the fearful event. Interestingly, while the detection, integration, and output units processing acute fear responses to different threats tend to be harbored in distinct brain circuits, memory encoding of these threats seems to rely on a shared learning system."
"Enhanced startle reactivity during exposure to unpleasant cues (aversive startle potentiation; ASP) appears in the RDoC matrix as a physiological index of acute threat response. Increased ASP has been linked to focal fear disorders and to scale measures of dispositional fearfulness (i.e., threat sensitivity; THT+). However, some studies have reported reduced ASP for fear pathology accompanied by major depressive disorder (MDD) or pervasive distress. The current study evaluated whether (a) THT+ as indexed by reported dispositional fearfulness mediates the relationship between fear disorders (when unaccompanied by depression) and ASP, and (b) depression moderates relations of THT+ and fear disorders with ASP. Fear disorder participants without MDD showed enhanced ASP whereas those with MDD (or other distress conditions) showed evidence of reduced ASP. Continuous THT+ scores also predicted ASP, and this association: (a) was likewise moderated by depression/distress, and (b) accounted for the relationship between ASP and fear pathology without MDD. These findings point to a role for the RDoC construct of acute threat, operationalized dispositionally, in enhanced ASP shown by individuals with fear pathology unaccompanied by distress pathology."
"STUDY DESIGN: Qualitative interview study. OBJECTIVE: Explore attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions related to low back pain (LBP) and analyze how these might influence the perceived threat associated with back pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Psychological factors that contribute to the perceived threat associated with LBP play an important role in back pain development and the progression to persistent pain and disability. Improved understanding of underlying beliefs may assist clinicians to investigate and assess these factors. METHODS: Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with 12 participants with acute LBP (<6-wk duration) and 11 participants with chronic LBP (>3 mo duration). Data were analyzed thematically using the framework of Interpretive Description. RESULTS: The back was viewed as being vulnerable to injury due to its design, the way in which it is used, and personal physical traits or previous injury. Consequently, participants considered that they needed to protect their back by resting, being careful with or avoiding dangerous activities, and strengthening muscles or controlling posture. Participants considered LBP to be special in its nature and impact, and they thought it difficult to understand without personal experience. The prognosis of LBP was considered uncertain by those with acute pain and poor by those with chronic pain. These beliefs combined to create a negative (mis)representation of the back. CONCLUSION: Negative assumptions about the back made by those with LBP may affect information processing during an episode of pain. This may result in attentional bias toward information indicating that the spine is vulnerable, an injury is serious, or the outcome will be poor. Approaching consultations with this understanding may assist clinicians to have a positive influence on beliefs. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3."
"BACKGROUND: Suicide remains poorly understood and unpredictable. Addressing this challenge, this study examined the independent contributions of several research domain criteria (RDoC) constructs in relation to suicidality in patients hospitalized for acute suicide risk. Specifically, we examined anhedonia, anxiety/entrapment, and attachment disturbances, reflecting disturbances in reward processes, negative valence systems, and social processes, respectively. METHODS: Anhedonia, anxiety, entrapment, and fearful attachment, were assessed quantitatively in 135 adults hospitalized for suicidality. Current suicidality and suicidal history were assessed with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Bivariate analyses (with significance threshold of p<.01 to account for multiple comparisons) and multivariate models examined relationships between symptom dimensions and severity of suicidal ideation (SI). We also assessed differences between patients with a history of suicide attempt and those who exhibited only suicidal ideations. RESULTS: Using bivariate analyses all symptoms except for fearful attachment correlated robustly with SI (r =.37-0.50, p<.001). However, when using multivariate analyses, only anhedonia (beta=.28, p=.01) and entrapment (beta=.19, p=.03) were independently associated with SI across the entire sample. No functional domain measures differed between patients with history of suicide attempt versus ideation only. LIMITATIONS: The reliance on self-report data and a cross-sectional design. CONCLUSIONS: Disturbances in reward and threat processing may represent independent factors in the development of suicidal ideation in this high suicide risk cohort. Future studies should assess their role as risk factors."
"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs in 12-25% of survivors of acute life-threatening medical events such as heart attack, stroke, and cancer, and is associated with recurrence of cardiac events and mortality in heart attack survivors. This article reviews the current state of knowledge about PTSD after such events, and proposes an Enduring Somatic Threat (EST) model of PTSD due to acute life-threatening medical events to address underappreciated differences between PTSD due to past, discrete/external traumatic events (such as combat) and PTSD due to acute manifestations of chronic disease that are enduring/internal in nature (such as heart attack and stroke). The differences include the external versus internal/somatic source of the threat, the past versus present/future temporal focus of threatening cognitions, the different types and consequences of avoidance behavior, and the different character and consequences of hyperarousal. Although important differences between the two types of PTSD exist, the EST model proposes that the underlying fear of mortality maintains PTSD symptoms due to both discrete/external and ongoing/somatic events. Finally, this article offers a research agenda for testing the EST model, with a particular focus on areas that may improve cardiovascular prognosis and health behaviors in survivors of heart attack and stroke."
"We describe the collaborative approach used by 2 health systems in Wisconsin to plan and prepare for the threat of Ebola virus disease. This was a descriptive study of the preparedness planning, infection prevention, and collaboration with public health agencies undertaken by 2 health systems in Wisconsin between September and December 2014. The preparedness approach used by the 2 health systems relied successfully on their robust infrastructure for planning and infection prevention. In the setting of rapidly evolving guidance and unprecedented fear regarding Ebola, the 2 health systems enhanced their response through collaboration and coordination with each other and government public health agencies. Key lessons learned included the importance of a rigorous planning process, robust infection prevention practices, and coalitions between public and private health sectors. The potential threat of Ebola virus disease stimulated emergency preparedness in which acute care facilities played a leading role in the public health response. Leveraging the existing expertise of health systems is essential when faced with emerging infectious diseases. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2016;10:691-697)."
"BACKGROUND: As many as 12% of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients screen positive for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms due to their cardiac event, and emergency department (ED) factors such as overcrowding have been associated with risk for PTSD. We tested the association of patients' perceptions of their proximity to a critically ill patient during ED evaluation for ACS with development of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PSS) in the month after hospital discharge. METHODS: Participants were enrolled in the REactions to Acute Care and Hospitalization (REACH) study during evaluation for ACS in an urban ED. Participants reported whether they perceived a patient near them was close to death. They also reported their current fear, concern they may die, perceived control, and feelings of vulnerability on an Emergency Room Perceptions questionnaire. One month later, participants reported on PTSD symptoms specific to the cardiac event and ED hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 763 participants, 12% reported perceiving a nearby patient was likely to die. In a multivariate linear regression model [F(9757) = 19.69, p < .001, R(2) adjusted = .18] with adjustment for age, sex, GRACE cardiac risk score, discharge ACS diagnosis, Charlson comorbidity index, objective ED crowding, and depression symptoms at baseline, perception of a nearby patients' likely death was associated with a 2.33 point (95% CI, 0.60-4.61) increase in 1 month PTSD score. A post hoc mediation analysis with personal threat perceptions [F(10,756) = 25.28, p < .001, R(2) adjusted = .24] showed increased personal threat perceptions during the ED visit, B = 0.71 points on the PCL per point on the personal threat perception questionnaire, beta = 0.27, p = .001, fully mediated association of participants' perceptions of nearby patients' likely death with 1-month PTSD score (after adjustment for ED threat perceptions,) B = 0.89 (95% CI, -1.33 to 3.12), beta = 0.03, p = .43, accounting for 62% of the adjusted effect and causing the main effect to become statistically nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS: We found patients who perceived a nearby patient was likely to die had significantly greater PTSD symptoms at 1 month. Awareness of this association may be helpful for designing ED patient management procedures to identify and treat patients with an eye to post-ACS psychological care."
"BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal injury is a significant threat to readiness in the US Army. Current injury surveillance methods are constrained by accurate injury reporting. Input into electronic medical records or databases therefore may not accurately reflect injury incidence. The purpose of this study was to evaluate injury reporting among active-duty US Army soldiers to explore potential limitations of surveillance approaches. HYPOTHESIS: A significant number of injuries go unreported to medical personnel. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4. METHODS: Surveys were completed by soldiers assigned to an Army Infantry Brigade Combat Team. Survey questions inquired about injuries sustained in the previous 12 months, injury onset, and whether injuries were reported to a medical provider. Participants were asked to rank reasons for accurately reporting, underreporting, and/or exaggerating injuries. Chi-square analyses were used to compare differences among underreported injuries in terms of injury onset (gradual vs acute) and sex. RESULTS: A total of 1388 soldiers reported 3202 injuries that had occurred in the previous 12-month period, including 1636 (51%) that were reported and 1566 (49%) that were identified as not reported to medical personnel. More than 49% of reported injuries were described as acute and 51% were described as chronic. Injury exaggeration was reported by 6% of soldiers. The most common reasons for not reporting injuries were fear that an injury might affect future career opportunities and avoidance of military ""profiles"" (mandated physical restrictions). CONCLUSION: Approximately half of musculoskeletal injuries in a Brigade Combat Team were not reported. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Unreported and untreated injuries can lead to reinjury, chronic pain, performance decrements, and increased costs associated with disability benefits. Additionally, unreported injuries can undermine injury surveillance efforts aimed at reducing the musculoskeletal injury problem in the military."
"The purpose of this study was to identify, through in-depth interview, factors that influenced 27 Hong Kong Chinese patients' decision-making in seeking early treatment for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The median delay time from the onset of symptoms to arrival at the hospital was 15.6 hours for men and 53.7 hours for women. Three major categories emerged from the data: (a) becoming aware of the threat, (b) maintaining a sense of normality, and (c) struggling to mobilize resources. A variety of decisions were made by patients from the onset of chest pain to seeking help. These decisions were heavily influenced by healthcare factors (access to emergency medical service (EMS) and treatment), personal factors (cognitive interpretations of symptoms), sociocultural factors (family situation, cultural beliefs, and practices), and coping strategies."
"In patients with acute leukemia we investigated the illness perceptions, lay theories and coping strategies 1 week after diagnosis. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 12 patients. The transcribed interviews were analyzed by methods of qualitative research. Dramatic narrations of overwhelming threat in younger patients contrast to rationalization in elderly patients. Feelings of helplessness and efforts of normalization become apparent. Intense descriptions of physical injury due to invasive procedures allow verbalizing the fear of the disease. While coping strategies are complex, the overall importance of trust is recognized. Mortal fears are indirectly indicated. The results have consequences for psycho-oncological training and patient education."
"CONTEXT: Bipolar/panic comorbidity has been observed in clinical, community and familial samples. As both are episodic disorders of affect regulation, the common pathophysiological mechanism is likely to involve deficits in amygdala-mediated, plasticity-dependent emotional conditioning. EVIDENCE: Neuronal genesis and synaptic remodeling occur in the amygdala; bipolar and panic disorders have both been associated with abnormality in the amygdala and related structures, as well as in molecules that modulate plasticity, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF). These biological elements are involved in behavioral conditioning to threat and reward. MODEL: Panic attacks resemble the normal acute fear response, but are abnormally dissociated from any relevant threat. Abnormal reward-seeking behavior is central to both manic and depressive syndromes. Appetites can be elevated or depressed; satisfaction of a drive may fail to condition future behavior. These dissociations may be the result of deficits in plasticity-dependent processes of conditioning within different amygdala subregions. CONCLUSIONS: This speculative model may be a useful framework with which to connect molecular, cellular, anatomic and behavioral processes in panic and bipolar disorders. The primary clinical implication is that behavioral treatment may be critical to restore function in some bipolar patients who respond only partially to medications."
"CONTEXT: As a multidimensional phenomenon, pain is influenced by various psychological factors. One such factor is catastrophizing, which is associated with higher pain intensity and emotional distress in cancer and noncancer pain. One possibility is that catastrophizing represents a general cognitive style that preferentially supports the processing of negative affective stimuli. Such preferential processing of threat--toward negative facial expressions, for example--is seen in emotional disorders and is sensitive to pharmacological treatment. Whether pharmacological (analgesic) treatment might also influence the processing of threat in pain patients is currently unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study investigates the effects catastrophizing on processing of facial affect in those receiving an acute opioid dose. METHODS: In a double-blind crossover design, the performance of 20 palliative care patients after their usual dose of immediate-release opioid was compared with their performance following matched-placebo administration on a facial affect recognition (i.e., speed and accuracy) and threat-pain estimation task (i.e., ratings of pain intensity). The influence of catastrophizing was examined by splitting the sample according to their score on the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). RESULTS: Opioid administration had no effect on facial affect processing compared with placebo. However, the main finding was that enhanced processing of fear, sadness, and disgust was found only in patients who scored highly on the PCS. There was no difference in performance between the two PCS groups on the other emotions (i.e., happiness, surprise, and anger). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that catastrophizing is associated with an affective information-processing bias in patients with severe pain conditions."
"BACKGROUND: Ebola is a highly infectious disease that is caused by viruses of the family Filoviridae and transmitted to humans by direct contact with animals infected from unknown natural reservoirs. Ebola virus infection induces acute fever and death within a few days in up to 90% of symptomatic individuals, causing widespread fear, panic, and antisocial behavior. Uganda is vulnerable to future Ebola outbreaks. Therefore, the survivors of Ebola and their family caregivers are likely to continue experiencing related antisocial overtones, leading to negative health outcomes. PURPOSE: This study articulated the lived experiences of survivors and their family caregivers after an Ebola outbreak in Kibale District, Western Uganda. Eliciting a deeper understanding of these devastating lifetime experiences provides opportunities for developing and implementing more compassionate and competent nursing care for affected persons. METHODS: Ebola survivors and their family caregivers were recruited using a purposive sampling method. Twelve (12) adult survivors and their family caregivers were recruited and were interviewed individually between May and July 2013 in Kibale, a rural district in Western Uganda close to the border of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where Ebola virus was first discovered in 1976. Oral and written informed consent was obtained before all in-depth interviews, and the researchers adhered to principles of anonymity and confidentiality. The interviews were recorded digitally, and data analysis employed Wertz's Empirical Psychological Reflection method, which is grounded in descriptive phenomenology. RESULTS: Living under the constant threat of Ebola is experienced through two main categories: (a) defining features of the experience and (b) responding to the traumatizing experience. Five themes emerged in the first category: (a) fear, ostracism, and stigmatization; (b) annihilation of sufferer's actualities and possibilities; (c) the lingering nature of the traumatic experience; (d) psychosomatic manifestations; and (e) the inescapable nature of the experience. The second category was composed of two themes: (a) seeking self-preservation and protection and (b) transcending victimhood and becoming empowered. CONCLUSIONS: Living under the constant threat of Ebola is experienced as distressing in the physical, social, and psychological realms. In the future, prompt treatment and nursing care are recommended to minimize deaths and to reduce the widespread terror, anxiety, ostracism, and stigmatization that affected individuals and families face. Furthermore, it is recommended that the resilience of survivors and caregivers be increased to facilitate their better coping with the rampant antisocial overtones that they are likely to experience because of their association with Ebola."
"After pediatric injury, transient traumatic stress reactions are common, and about 1 in 6 children and their parents develop persistent posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms that are linked to poorer physical and functional recovery. Meta-analytic studies identify risk factors for persistent PTS, including preinjury psychological problems, peritrauma fear and perceived life threat, and posttrauma factors such as low social support, maladaptive coping strategies, and parent PTS symptoms. There is growing prospective data indicating that children's subjective appraisals of the injury and its aftermath influence PTS development. Secondary prevention of injury-related PTS often involves parents and focuses on promoting adaptive child appraisals and coping strategies. Web-based psychoeducation and targeted brief early intervention for injured children and their parents have shown a modest effect, but additional research is needed to refine preventive approaches. There is a strong evidence base for effective psychological treatment of severe and persistent PTS via trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy; evidence is lacking for psychopharmacological treatment. Pediatric clinicians play a key role in preventing injury-related PTS by providing ""trauma-informed"" pediatric care (ie, recognizing preexisting trauma, addressing acute traumatic stress reactions associated with the injury event, minimizing potentially traumatic aspects of treatment, and identifying children who need additional monitoring or referral)."
"The threat of outbreak of infectious disease such as non-seasonal influenza A (H1N1), commonly referred to as Swine Flu, can provoke the implementation of public health control measures such as quarantine. This paper summarises the psychosocial consequences that may follow for patients and health care and other front-line workers when using quarantine controls. Those affected by quarantine are likely to report distress due to fear and risk perceptions. This distress can be amplified in the face of unclear information and communication that is common in the initial period of disease outbreaks. This paper outlines recommendations for care of those in quarantine and those working with them, such as helping to identify stressors and normalising their impact as much as possible. This should take place at all levels of response, from public information and communication messages to individual face-to-face advice and support."
"According to the Greek Penal Law if someone ""because of a morbid disturbance of his mental functioning"" (article 34) is acquitted of a crime or misdemeanour that the law punishes with more than 6 months imprisonment, then the court orders that this individual should be kept in a public psychiatric institution if the court reaches the conclusion that this person poses a threat to public safety.1 Individuals who have broken the law and deemed ""not guilty by reason of insanity"" are treated in psychiatric units of Psychiatric Hospitals according to the article 69 of the Penal Code. In Athens, in the Psychiatric Hospital of Athens and the Dromokaiteion Psychiatric Hospital, and in Thessaloniki in the Unit for ""Not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI)"". The person who is deemed not guilty by reason of insanity following a crime is facing double stigmatisation and marginalisation from both the legal and the health system. He/she is usually treated initially with fear and later since there is no therapeutic aim but only the court instruction for ""guardianship"", with indifference. The patient who is committed by the courts in a psychiatric unit for being ""NGRI"" is facing a unique legal and psychiatric status.2 In this respect he/she is disadvantaged when compared to either convicted criminals or psychiatric inpatients. If the patient was not found ""NGRI"" (ie innocent as far as sentencing is concerned) he would have been punished with loss of liberty for a certain (specific) amount of time, and like all individuals convicted in court he/she would have the right to appeal and reduce his/her sentence in a higher court and maybe released from prison earlier for good behaviour etc. In this respect the individual found to be ""NGRI"" is disadvantaged when compared to a convicted felon since he/she is kept for an undefined period of time. Additionally, he/she will be allowed to leave the psychiatric unit following a subjective assessment of a judge with no psychiatric knowledge who will decide that this certain individual has ""ceased to be dangerous"". These problems are accentuated by the difficulties that the Greek justice system is facing. On the other side, from the psychiatric point of view, the ""NGRI"" patient who is an inpatient is not receiving the holistic, (bio psycho social) treatment and assessment of needs he/she requires. The psychiatric team looking after him, once the acute symptomatology is controlled is just getting used to a patient who will not be discharged in the immediate future. These patients form the ""new chronic asylum psychiatric inpatients"" for whom the treating psychiatrists are not allowed to discharge back into the community whilst it is unclear whether they can be transferred to supported rehabilitation units. It is a medical but also legal paradox to assign to contemporary psychiatric units aiming mainly to treat patients in the community to ""keep and guard"" inpatients whilst these psychiatric units should focus on care and rehabilitation of the patients (including the ""NGRIs"").3 Keeping patients like these in psychiatric units creates problems in the functioning of the units. These patients are ""kept"" in acute beds for long periods of time (5 to 6 years minimum) with patients treated voluntarily or against their will and cannot be discharged without a court's decision. The problems are obvious if one realises that the average time of hospitalisation is not exceeding 2 months for the vast majority of psychiatric patients. With the prolonged stay patients of the ""article 69"" (NGRIs) they not only burden the already limited resources (there is an established lack of psychiatric beds nationwide) but also this prolonged hospitalisation increases their stigmatisation and marginalisation. Thus the prolonged hospitalisation for ""safety"" reasons according to the court decision leads to the absence of a therapeutic aim other than maintaining the patient on the ward. Greece has agreed that there is an urgent need in developing community psychiatry services and closure/transformation of the big psychiatric hospitals (asylums). It is impossible to close hospitals where ""NGRIs"" are kept. The decision to move them into the community is not a medical-psychiatric but a legal one. In this respect it is imperative to establish a Forensic Psychiatric Unit for these patients. In our country as the ""Psychargos"" external evaluation highlighted, there are great gaps in the provision of Forensic psychiatric services.3 It must be emphasised that these gaps affect negatively psychiatric reform and social reintegration not only for the forensic psychiatric patients but for the whole of mentally ill individuals. Given that forensic Psychiatric services are developed in Athens and Thessaloniki and that training in Forensic Psychiatry has moved forward, it is imperative that the state should build upon the existing knowledge and experience and create specialist forensic units aiming to treat and rehabilitate this special and important group of patients.4 Only when the patients found ""not guilty by reasons of insanity"" have their own (safe for the society and them) therapeutic and rehabilitative services the aim of de-institutionalisation will be visible and realistic to implement."
"Studies of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are complicated by wide variability in the intensity and duration of prior stressors in patient participants, secondary effects of chronic psychiatric illness, and a variable history of treatment with psychiatric medications. In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, patient samples have often been small, and they were not often compared to similarly stressed patients without PTSD in order to control for general stress effects. Findings from these studies have been inconsistent. The present study investigated whole-brain microstructural alterations of white matter in a large drug-naive population who survived a specific, severe traumatic event (a major 8.0-magnitude earthquake). Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we explored group differences between 88 PTSD patients and 91 matched traumatized non-PTSD controls in fractional anisotropy (FA), as well as its component elements axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD), and examined these findings in relation to findings from deterministic DTI tractography. Relations between white matter alterations and psychiatric symptom severity were examined. PTSD patients, relative to similarly stressed controls, showed an FA increase as well as AD and RD changes in the white matter beneath left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and forceps major. The observation of increased FA in the PTSD group suggests that the pathophysiology of PTSD after a specific acute traumatic event is distinct from what has been reported in patients with several years duration of illness. Alterations in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may be an important aspect of illness pathophysiology, possibly via the region's established role in fear extinction circuitry. Use-dependent myelination or other secondary compensatory changes in response to heightened demands for threat appraisal and emotion regulation may be involved."
"BACKGROUND: Infection prevention remains a significant challenge for healthcare systems. Yet despite considerable work to provide clear policies and scientifically proven techniques to reduce infection transmission, beliefs and practices of healthcare workers do not always concur with scientific rationale. AIM: To provide explanations for nurses' infection prevention behaviours. METHODS: An interpretative, qualitative approach was taken using semi-structured interviews. Twenty interviews with registered nurses working in an acute hospital setting were conducted. Analysis was conducted using the Framework method. FINDINGS: This paper focuses on the theme 'protection from dirt'. Within the findings clear distinction was made between infection and dirt. Fear of contact with dirt, particularly dirt belonging to those who were unknown, was a key driver in behaviour carried out to reduce threat. Familiarity with the patient resulted in a reduction of the protective behaviours required. These behaviours, which initially appeared as part of an infection prevention strategy, were primarily a form of self-protection from patients, who at first encounter were considered as dirty. CONCLUSION: Behaviours do not always fit with a rational response to infection, but instead may be responses to dirt. Any programme that simply attempts to address scientific knowledge and behaviour deficits is unlikely to have the desired goals if it does not take into account existing social constructions of dirt and the response it evokes."
"The Mouse Defense Test Battery was developed from tests of defensive behaviors in rats, reflecting earlier studies of both acute and chronic responses of laboratory and wild rodents to threatening stimuli and situations. It measures flight, freezing, defensive threat and attack, and risk assessment in response to an unconditioned predator stimulus, as well as pretest activity and postthreat (conditioned) defensiveness to the test context. Factor analyses of these indicate four factors relating to cognitive and emotional aspects of defense, flight, and defensiveness to the test context. In the Mouse Defense Test Battery, GABA(A)-benzodiazepine anxiolytics produce consistent reductions in defensive threat/attack and risk assessment, while panicolytic and panicogenic drugs selectively reduce and enhance, respectively, flight. Effects of GABA(A)-benzodiazepine, serotonin, and neuropeptide ligands in the Mouse Defense Test Battery are reviewed. This review suggests that the Mouse Defense Test Battery is a sensitive and appropriate tool for preclinical evaluation of drugs potentially effective against defense-related disorders such as anxiety and panic."
"BACKGROUND: Socio-emotional development is the expression and management of emotions, which in non-human primates can be examined using responses toward increasing levels of threat. Damage to the limbic system alters socio-emotional development in primates. Thus, neuronal and glial cell loss caused by exposure to general anaesthesia early in infancy might also impact socio-emotional development. We recently reported that repeated sevoflurane exposure in the first month of life alters emotional behaviours at 6 months of age and impairs visual recognition memory after the first year of life in rhesus monkeys. The present study evaluated socio-emotional behaviour at 1 and 2 yr of age in those same monkeys to determine the persistence of altered emotional behaviour. METHODS: Rhesus monkeys of both sexes were exposed to sevoflurane anaesthesia three times for 4 h each time in the first 6 weeks of life. At 1 and 2 yr of age, they were tested on the human intruder task, a well-established mild acute social stressor. RESULTS: Monkeys exposed to sevoflurane as infants exhibited normal fear and hostile responses, but exaggerated self-directed (displacement) behaviours, a general indicator of stress and anxiety in non-human primates. CONCLUSIONS: Early repeated sevoflurane exposure in infant non-human primates results in an anxious phenotype that was first detected at 6 months, and persists for at least 2 yr of age. This is the first demonstration of such a prolonged impact of early anaesthesia exposure on emotional reactivity."
"Young animals respond to threatening stimuli in an age-specific way. Their endocrine and behavioral responses reflect the potential threat of the situation at a given age. The aim of the present study was to determine whether corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is involved in the endocrine and behavioral responses to threat and their developmental changes in young rats. Preweaning 14-day-old and postweaning 26-day-old rats were exposed to two age-specific threats, cat odor and an adult male rat. The acute behavioral response was determined during exposure. After exposure, the time courses of the corticosterone response and of CRF expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) and in extrahypothalamic areas were assessed. Preweaning rats became immobile when exposed to cat odor or the male rat, whereas postweaning rats became immobile to cat odor only. Male exposure increased serum corticosterone levels in 14-day-old rats, but cat odor failed to increase levels at either age. Exposure induced elevation of CRF mRNA levels in the PVN that paralleled changes in corticosterone levels. CRF may thus play a role in endocrine regulation and its developmental changes during early life. Neither cat odor nor the adult male altered CRF mRNA levels in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) or the amygdala, but both stimuli increased levels in the hippocampus. Hippocampal CRF mRNA expression levels did not parallel cat odor or male-induced immobility, indicating that CRF is not involved in this response in young rats but may be involved in aspects of learning and memory."
"1. There is suggestive evidence that the septo-hippocampal system and the amygdala are involved in risk assessment behavior, a response to potential threat possibly related to anxiety. In addition, experimental results have been reported implicating the medial hypothalamus in coordinated escape, while the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) and the median raphe nucleus serotonergic projection to the hippocampus seem to mediate freezing. The latter defensive behaviors are evoked by distal danger stimuli and may be viewed as manifestations of fear. Finally, there is a sound body of evidence indicating that the PAG commands primitive fight or flight reactions elicited by proximal threat, acute pain or asphyxia. These defense reactions may be related to rage and panic, respectively. In contrast, the lateral septal area and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis have been shown to exert tonic inhibitory influence on defense. 2. Experimental evidence indicates that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) tonically inhibits defensive behavior in the amygdala, hypothalamus and the PAG, an effect opposed by excitatory amino acids. Among monoamines, serotonin (5-HT) has been suggested to facilitate anxiety in the amygdala while inhibiting panic in the PAG. The role of noradrenaline in defense is less clear, although hypotheses implicating the locus coeruleus in anxiety and panic have been suggested. Among peptides, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) acting as a central neurotransmitter is thought to mediate behavioral and physiological effects of acute stress, while opioid peptides have been shown to inhibit defense in the amygdala and in the dorsal PAG. Finally, acetylcholine seems to facilitate defensive behavior in the hypothalamus and the PAG."
"OBJECTIVES: To (1) identify aspects that defined the self-perceived worst panic attack, (2) determine how subjects with panic attacks perceive symptoms compared with control subjects, and (3) determine the role of symptom perceptions in seeking care for the worst panic attack. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Community-based. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-seven subjects with panic attacks as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition (with or without panic disorder), and 97 demographically matched controls. INTERVENTION: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjects and controls completed the Symptom Perception Scales, and subjects with panic attacks completed the Acute Panic Inventory and a questionnaire concerning care-seeking behavior for their self-perceived worst attack. RESULTS: Compared with controls, subjects with panic attacks perceived many symptoms as more embarrassing but differed little in their perceptions of need for treatment, threat to life, and disruption of functioning. Particular symptoms (ie, dyspnea, fear, dizziness, and faintness) tended to differ in most perceptions. However, symptom perceptions did not play a significant role in care-seeking behavior for the worst attack. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with panic attacks perceive symptoms as more embarrassing than controls, and have different perceptions about particular symptoms. Cognitive approaches addressing negative patient perceptions may reduce anxiety, inappropriate use of health care services, and adverse outcomes. Arch Fam Med. 2000;9:1028-1035"
"The inability to discriminate between threat and safety is a hallmark of stress-induced psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder. Dorsolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTdl) is critically involved in the modulation of fear and anxiety, and has been proposed to regulate discrimination between signaled (cued, predictable) and unsignaled (unpredictable) threats. We recently showed that oxytocin receptors (OTRs) in the BNSTdl facilitate acquisition of cued fear measured in a fear-potentiated startle (FPS). In the current study, using in vivo microdialysis in awake male Sprague-Dawley rats, a double immunofluorescence approach with confocal microscopy, as well as retrograde tracing of hypothalamic BNST-projecting OT neurons, we investigated whether fear conditioning activates OT system and modulates OT release. To determine the role of OTR in fear memory formation, we also infused OTR antagonist or OT into the BNSTdl before fear conditioning and measured rats' ability to discriminate between cued (signaled) and non-cued (unsignaled) fear using FPS. In contrast to acute stress (exposure to forced swim stress or foot shocks alone), cued fear conditioning increases OT content in BNSTdl microdialysates. In addition, fear conditioning induces moderate activation of OT neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and robust activation in the supraoptic and accessory nuclei of the hypothalamus. Application of OT into the BNSTdl facilitates fear learning toward signaled, predictable threats, whereas blocking OTR attenuates this effect. We conclude that OTR neurotransmission in the BNSTdl plays a pivotal role in strengthening fear learning of temporally predictable, signaled threats."
"The post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is defined as a severe anxiety disorder that develops after exposure to an event with actual, threatened, or perceived death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of oneself or others that results in significant psychological trauma. Moreover, the ability of people to handle acute severe stress experiences varies among individuals. Depending on the underlying personality and resiliency, therefore, PTSD can occur in individuals exposed to exceedingly stressful incidences or those who have encountered seemingly less overwhelming stressors. In addition to severe stressful exposure, multiple other factors including genetic susceptibility; past experiences; cultural, spiritual, and personal beliefs; bullying and harassments; and lack of support at the workplace, social, and home environement may contribute to the development of PTSD. Author investigated multiple potential mechanisms for the development and sustenance of PTSD based on the recent literature and his own experiences and insight. Based on this search, author indicates that among other pathological and biochemical abnormalities, hormonal aberrations are most likely key mechanisms initiating and the maintenance of the PTSD. These pathophysiological neuro-hormonal changes instigate maladaptive learning processes caused by sustained high levels of anxiety and fear, through a hypo-responsive hypothalamic-pituitary axis and hyper-responsive catecholamine system (persistently elevated blood norepinephrine levels and lower than appropriate glucocorticoid levels). In addition to having inappropriately low serum cortisol levels and high epinephrine and norepinephrine levels, patients with PTSD also have mitochondrial dysfunctions and other hormonal abnormalities. Based on these data, author concluded that these pathological, biochemical and sustained neurohormonal abnormalities are likely to influence the structural brain changes, particularly in the amygdala and hippocampus, which are characteristics of patients with PTSD. Considering these abnormalities, neuroendocrine system needs to be considered as a key target for new drug development for prevention and treatment of PTSD."
"There is growing evidence that drugs of abuse alter processing of emotional information in ways that could be attractive to users. Our recent report that Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) diminishes amygdalar activation in response to threat-related faces suggests that THC may modify evaluation of emotionally-salient, particularly negative or threatening, stimuli. In this study, we examined the effects of acute THC on evaluation of emotional images. Healthy volunteers received two doses of THC (7.5 and 15 mg; p.o.) and placebo across separate sessions before performing tasks assessing facial emotion recognition and emotional responses to pictures of emotional scenes. THC significantly impaired recognition of facial fear and anger, but it only marginally impaired recognition of sadness and happiness. The drug did not consistently affect ratings of emotional scenes. THC's effects on emotional evaluation were not clearly related to its mood-altering effects. These results support our previous work, and show that THC reduces perception of facial threat. Nevertheless, THC does not appear to positively bias evaluation of emotional stimuli in general."
"Terrorist acts and the fear of terrorism have become a part of everyday life in the early 21st century. Among the threats most feared is bioterrorism, including the intentional release of smallpox. With the invasion of Iraq and toppling of the Saddam Hussein regime, acute bioterrorism fears have abated; however, an ongoing threat remains.This article addresses the need for knowledge and rational policies in dealing with potential bioterrorism attacks. It presents information on four of the most likely bioterrorism agents: smallpox, anthrax, botulism, and plague. It illustrates the importance of accurate knowledge and rational decision making in addressing the threat of terrorism through the intentional release of biological weapons such as smallpox. Finally, it provides information essential for social workers to make informed practice decisions, to educate clients and the public, and to advocate for sound public policy."
"As the first emerging epidemic of the 21st century, SARS has raised much interest and fear among statesmen, economists, and the general public, as well as within the medical community. This new disease is characterized by several daunting challenges, including person-to-person transmission, an environmentally resistant agent, a non-specific clinical presentation, and a high fatality rate among high risk individuals. In Israel, as elsewhere, public health authorities were forced to quickly design appropriate measures to confront this new threat. The Israeli guidelines for surveillance, epidemiologic investigation and intervention in the event of a SARS outbreak were drafted in the absence of complete data on some of the most basic epidemiologic characteristics of the disease. Discrepancies between published guidelines from several countries made the decision-making process even more complicated. We describe the epidemiologic guidelines for SARS drafted by the Israeli working group, as well as the considerations on which they are based. The recent experience with this new outbreak has already provided several valuable lessons on policy making which may help future planning for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases."
"Inhalation of low concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) triggers anxious behaviours in rodents via chemosensors in the amygdala, and increases anxiety, autonomic arousal and hypervigilance in healthy humans. However, it is not known whether CO2 inhalation modulates defensive behaviours coordinated by this network in humans. We examined the effect of 7.5% CO2 challenge on the defensive eye-blink startle response. A total of 27 healthy volunteers completed an affective startle task during inhalation of 7.5% CO2 and air. The magnitude and latency of startle eye-blinks were recorded whilst participants viewed aversive and neutral pictures. We found that 7.5% CO2 increased state anxiety and raised concurrent measures of skin conductance and heart rate (HR). CO2 challenge did not increase startle magnitude, but slowed the onset of startle eye-blinks. The effect of CO2 challenge on HR covaried with its effects on both subjective anxiety and startle latency. Our findings are discussed with reference to startle profiles during conditions of interoceptive threat, increased cognitive load and in populations characterised by anxiety, compared with acute fear and panic."
"Not since 1945 has the world experienced nuclear warfare, although there has been the threat of nuclear terrorism and a large number of nuclear/radiological accidents. Most people fear a nuclear/radiological threat even more than a conventional explosion due both to their inability to perceive the presence of radiation with the ordinary human senses and to concerns about perceived long-lasting radiation effects. Studies of radiological accidents have found that for every actually contaminated casualty, there may be as many as 500 people who are concerned, eager to be screened for contamination, sometimes panicked, and showing psychosomatic reactions mimicking actual radiation effects. Data from the Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks revealed widespread acute reactions such as psychic numbing, severe anxiety, and disorganized behavior, and there were later chronic effects such as survivor guilt and psychosomatic reactions. Such responses would likely be common in any future nuclear/radiological accident, terrorist attack, or warfare."
"The effect of the anxiogenic beta-carboline, FG-7142, on defense and approach-attack behavior in the cat was investigated. FG-7142 (10 mg/kg) enhanced defensive responses to rats and mice when tested 10 and 20 min after injection. At the same time, FG-7142 suppressed approach and attack responses to prey. Behavioral effects of FG-7142 were blocked by the specific benzodiazepine receptor blocker RO-15-1788 (10 mg/kg). One or two administrations of FG-7142 were sufficient to produce a lasting (up to 105 days) enhancement of defensive response to rats but not to mice. Defensive response to conspecific threat vocalizations was also lastingly increased. Two injections of FG-7142 produced a lasting suppression of approach-attack on rats only, whereas one injection of FG-7142 did not. The lasting suppression of some measures of approach-attack was found to be independent of the fear-enhancing properties of FG-7142. Tests of the effects of RO-15-1788 on the lasting after-effects of FG-7142 revealed at least two mechanisms which mediate the lasting changes in behavior, one which is dependent upon the benzodiazepine receptor and one which is not. The implications of these findings for rodent models of anxiety which use response suppression to assess fearful 'anxiogenic' effects of drugs are discussed."
"A retrospective review of the charts of 52 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the New York Hospital was conducted to determine the prevalence of recorded psychiatric complications and the use of psychiatric consultation. Neuropsychiatric complications were found to be pervasive clinical features in AIDS patients hospitalized during acute illness. Mood disturbance was identified in an overwhelming majority of the patients (82.7 percent), and signs of organic mental syndrome (DSM III) were noted in 65.4 percent; references to neuropsychiatric complications appeared in every patient's chart. Neurological complications were seldom explicitly diagnosed or treated. Psychiatric consultation was requested for 10 patients (19.2 percent) because of management problems, for diagnostic assessment, or by self-referral. Only one patient was given a psychiatric diagnosis at discharge. The results suggest that the neuropsychiatric complications of AIDS are underdiagnosed during acute medical illness and that psychiatric consultation is underutilized. AIDS patients have a heightened risk of psychological problems. Contributing factors may include the threat to life, severe physical debilitation, central nervous system involvement, fear of contagion, disclosure of homosexuality or drug abuse, and guilt associated with sexual transmission."
"BACKGROUND: Users of +/-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), ""ecstasy,"" report that the drug produces unusual psychological effects, including increased empathy and prosocial feelings. These ""empathogenic"" effects are cited as reasons for recreational ecstasy use and also form the basis for the proposed use of MDMA in psychotherapy. However, they have yet to be characterized in controlled studies. Here, we investigate effects of MDMA on an important social cognitive capacity, the identification of emotional expression in others, and on socially relevant mood states. METHODS: Over four sessions, healthy ecstasy-using volunteers (n = 21) received MDMA (.75, 1.5 mg/kg), methamphetamine (METH) (20 mg), and placebo under double-blind, randomized conditions. They completed self-report ratings of relevant affective states and undertook tasks in which they identified emotions from images of faces, pictures of eyes, and vocal cues. RESULTS: MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) significantly increased ratings of feeling ""loving"" and ""friendly"", and MDMA (.75 mg/kg) increased ""loneliness"". Both MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) and METH increased ""playfulness""; only METH increased ""sociability"". MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) robustly decreased accuracy of facial fear recognition relative to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The drug MDMA increased ""empathogenic"" feelings but reduced accurate identification of threat-related facial emotional signals in others, findings consistent with increased social approach behavior rather than empathy. This effect of MDMA on social cognition has implications for both recreational and therapeutic use. In recreational users, acute drug effects might alter social risk-taking while intoxicated. Socioemotional processing alterations such as those documented here might underlie possible psychotherapeutic benefits of this drug; further investigation of such mechanisms could inform treatment design to maximize active components of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy."
"The hypothesis that panic disorder is a separate biological disease has attracted a great deal of controversy in recent years. One of the cornerstones of this theory is that panic attacks arise spontaneously, suggesting that the illness is generated by an autonomous physiological process. A number of cases are reported that illustrate Beck's theory that cognitive factors are central to the genesis of acute anxiety. Evidence for a developmental/cognitive theory of anxiety is discussed, and it is concluded that a purely biological model for panic disorder is inadequate."
"AIM: This paper reports a study to describe meanings that couples mutually assign to, and practices they develop, after the onset of cardiac disease and to understand the impact of the illness on the couples' relationships in everyday life. BACKGROUND: Patients as well as partners are affected by the onset of cardiovascular disease. Social support within intimate relationships has been shown to be important for patient survival and well-being, and couples' coping strategies are pivotal for well-being and adjustment to the chronic condition in both patients with cardiovascular disease and their partners. METHOD: Twenty-four couples participated in this phenomenological study. Data were collected during 2003. Participants were interviewed after having been hospitalized due to an acute event and having participated in a rehabilitation programme. Three in-depth interviews were obtained for each dyad: one couple interview and two individual interviews with each partner of the dyad. Paradigm cases were sought and thematic analyses conducted. FINDINGS: All couples experienced a 'brush with death' at the onset of heart disease, which called for changes in lifestyle. Three distinct patterns of dealing with the illness emerged. The first revealed that some couples assess the illness as a positive, transformative experience in their lives, bringing them closer together. The second showed that a proportion of couples experience the illness as a threat which imposes fear on both partners. The challenges are faced as mutual tasks and new routines are developed. The third pattern revealed couples who experience a missed opportunity to change. These couples are disenchanted about each other but return to life as usual. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses can use the information gained from this study to support couples in their attempts to come to terms with the illness, and can enhance their supportive role in rehabilitation efforts."
"OBJECTIVE: Virulent airborne diseases can be a real burden to a nation's health system. The most recent threat is the fear of a mutation-induced H5N1-influenza pandemic. We studied whether Belgian hospitals are able to deal with H5N1-influenza infected patients in the case of a pandemic. Many patients, including children, may require artificial ventilation within 48 h after admission. METHODS: A survey aimed at determining 'availability and preparedness' was sent by e-mail to the different Belgian Emergency Departments. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Sixty-five hospitals were finally included. The amount of patients being potentially admitted is limited, owing to the reduced number of intensive care beds equipped with automatic ventilators. Furthermore, the number of available intensive care beds for children is still lower than for adult patients. The number of mortuary places, in the case of a catastrophe, is also insufficient. Although most hospitals set up a disaster plan on H5N1, there are only limited stocks of antiviral medication to protect the hospital staff in the acute phase. A separate triage area is only available in a limited number of hospitals. We conclude that Belgian hospitals and emergency departments are not equipped to deal with potential pandemic situations."
"The Research Domain Criteria initiative aims to reorient the focus of psychopathology research toward biobehavioral constructs that cut across different modalities of measurement, including self-report and neurophysiology. Constructs within the Research Domain Criteria framework are intentionally transdiagnostic, with the construct of ""acute threat,"" for example, broadly relevant to clinical problems and associated traits involving fearfulness and stress reactivity. A potentially valuable referent for research on the construct of acute threat is a structural model of fear/fearlessness questionnaires known to predict variations in physiological threat reactivity as indexed by startle potentiation. The aim of the current work was to develop an efficient, item-based scale measure of the general factor of this structural model for use in studies of dispositional threat sensitivity and its relationship to psychopathology. A self-report scale consisting of 44 items from a conceptually relevant, nonproprietary questionnaire was first developed in a sample of 1,307 student participants, using the general factor of the fear/fearlessness model as a direct referent. This new Trait Fear scale was then evaluated for convergent and discriminant validity with measures of personality and psychopathology in a separate sample ( n = 213) consisting of community adults and undergraduate students. The strong performance of the scale in this criterion-validation sample suggests that it can provide an effective means for indexing variations along a dispositional continuum of fearfulness reflecting variations in sensitivity to acute threat."
"RATIONALE: Recent psychopharmacological studies lend support to the notion of partially dissociable neuronal systems dedicated to processing specific emotions. For example, GABA-ergic enhancement after an acute dose of the benzodiazepine, diazepam, produces specific impairments in anger and fear recognition. However, it is unclear if these impairments are a general property of benzodiazepines and other drugs that produce a similar profile of neurocognitive impairment to benzodiazepines, such as the anticholinergic, scopolamine. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of scopolamine and the benzodiazepine, lorazepam, on emotion-recognition accuracy. METHODS: A double-blind independent group design was used with 48 healthy volunteers to compare the effects of scopolamine and lorazepam with an inactive placebo on a commonly used emotion-recognition task. Control measures included an episodic memory task and subjective mood ratings. RESULTS: Anger and disgust recognition accuracy was impaired after scopolamine. In contrast, lorazepam produced no impairment in emotion-recognition despite producing similar levels of sedation and anterograde amnesia to scopolamine. CONCLUSIONS: Scopolamine-induced cholinergic hypofunction selectively impaired the recognition accuracy of disgust and anger facial expressions. The effects of scopolamine on emotion-recognition are similar to those found in Huntington's disease patients. Furthermore, the impairments in anger and fear recognition previously observed with diazepam do not appear to be a general property of benzodiazepines. This suggests that alterations in emotional processing involving changes in the ability to recognize threat-related emotions (particularly, fear and anger) may not be a principal mechanism underlying anxiolysis or paradoxical aggression seen with benzodiazepines."
"The Zika virus is a flavivirus spread by mosquitoes. Its primary vectors are the Aedes aegypti and the Aedes albopictus. Before 2007 it sporadically caused benign morbidity. Since 2015, it started spreading ""explosively"" in America, especially in Brazil. In August 2016 they reported cases from New York and Poland, too. Most of the infections don't produce any symptoms, but can cause grave complications. The most important lesion is microcephalia that forms in fetuses. Microcephalia's most serious consequence is mental retardation, which puts great burden on both the family and the society. The viral infection increases the incidence of Guillain-Barre syndrome. This is an acute autoimmune disease which causes demyelination and, in the worst cases, it can also be fatal. Yet we do not possess adequate and specific vaccination nor antiviral therapy, although, since July 2016, the effectiveness of a DNA based vaccine is being tested on humans. More than half of the world's population lives in areas contaminated by infected mosquitoes so there is a great need for the development of an effective method against the vector mosquitoes. Sadly, even the vector control strategies aren't effective enough to push back the epidemic. Pregnant or fertile women must take the highest precautions against mosquito bites, especially if they travel to regions ravaged by the epidemic. The safest solution would be to postpone both the trip and the childbearing. In Europe, the vectors aren't spread enough to cause major threat, except maybe the warmer regions bordered by the Mediterranean Sea. However, it is possible that in the near future other viruses spread by Aedes mosquitoes could appear. Naturally, the travellers and immigrants, who came from endemic regions can also contribute to the spread of the epidemic. Thanks to the changes in global weather, there were reported findings of mosquitoes of the Aedes albopictus species in Hungary, which are slowly invading the continent, although we do not have information about their settlement in the country. The doctors may encounter introduced cases and we do not have to fear the spreading of the epidemic to our country, but in the bordering Slovakia and Slovenia infections have been reported. The future of the Zika virus is yet unpredictable, although looking at the global spread of the Dengue and Chikungunya viruses, a worldwide spread is expectable in the near future. Orv. Hetil., 2017, 158(15), 563-571."
"In this review we address primarily the role of ASICs in determining sensory signals from arterial baroreceptors, peripheral chemoreceptors, and cardiopulmonary and somatic afferents. Alterations in these sensory signals during acute cardiovascular stresses result in changes in sympathetic and parasympathetic activities that restore cardiovascular homeostasis. In pathological states, however, chronic dysfunctions of these afferents result in serious sympatho-vagal imbalances with significant increases in mortality and morbidity. We identified a role for ASIC2 in the mechano-sensitivity of aortic baroreceptors and of ASIC3 in the pH sensitivity of carotid bodies. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, we reported decreased expression of ASIC2 in nodose ganglia neurons and overexpression of ASIC3 in carotid bodies. This reciprocal expression of ASIC2 and ASIC3 results in reciprocal changes in sensory sensitivity of baro- and chemoreceptors and a consequential synergistic exaggeration sympathetic nerve activity. A similar reciprocal sensory dysautonomia prevails in heart failure and increases the risk of mortality. There is also evidence that ASIC heteromers in skeletal muscle afferents contribute significantly to the exercise pressor reflex. In cardiac muscle afferents of the dorsal root ganglia, they contribute to nociception and to the detrimental sympathetic activation during ischemia. Finally, we report that an inhibitory influence of ASIC2-mediated baroreceptor activity suppresses the sympatho-excitatory reflexes of the chemoreceptors and skeletal muscle afferents, as well as the ASIC1a-mediated excitation of central neurons during fear, threat, or panic. The translational potential of activation of ASIC2 in cardiovascular disease states may be a beneficial sympatho-inhibition and parasympathetic activation. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Acid-Sensing Ion Channels in the Nervous System'."
"Many people with haematological cancers will not meet the diagnostic criteria for a psychological disorder, but will still suffer distress during treatment and beyond. The current study aimed to explore the nature and timing of psychosocial distress experienced by haematological cancer survivors. Twenty-three post-treatment haematological cancer survivors participated in a semi-structured interview. Data were analysed using thematic analysis which involved identifying, analysing and reporting themes. Four themes were identified: Apprehension about leaving the safety of the health care system comprises the struggles encountered when transitioning from patient to survivor, Uncertainty and life transitions in the post-treatment period encompasses the changes survivors face when attempting to re-enter their ""normal"" lives, Distress associated with ongoing physical problems or impairment describes issues associated with the ongoing physical sequelae, and Fear of recurrence encapsulates how the continuing threat of cancer recurrence impacted survivors. This study has found that distress is ongoing for many haematological cancer survivors in the post-treatment period. It is imperative that distress is identified and support offered to those in need to prevent further psychosocial issues. It is especially important to consider the psychosocial needs of survivors in the post-treatment stage who are discharged from the health system may be unsure where to seek help."
"Pathological changes in the organs and tissues of beach-stranded, net-caught or captive small odontocete cetaceans (whales and dolphins) are reported. These changes include contraction band necrosis of cardiac and smooth muscles, smooth muscle spasm, ischemic injury to the intestinal mucosa (especially the mucosa of the small intestine) and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) of the proximal tubules of the nephron. Spastic contraction of terminal bronchiolar muscular sphincters was also observed. The changes are consistent with multi-systemic injury caused by massive release of endogenous catecholamines or vasospasm leading to ischemic injury, followed by reperfusion and reperfusion injury. The histopathological findings suggest that the reflex response of an odontocete to any major perceived threat (the ""alarm reaction"") is to activate the physiological adaptations to diving or escape to an extreme or pathological level, resulting, if greatly prolonged, in widespread ischemic injury to tissues. These observations may explain why these species die abruptly from handling or transportation and why the mortality of highly stressed beach-stranded animals is very high."
"CONTEXT: Rapid mental health surveillance during the acute phase of a disaster response can inform the allocation of limited clinical resources and provide essential household-level risk estimates for recovery planning. OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of the PsySTART Rapid Mental Health Triage and Incident Management System for individual-level clinical triage and traumatic exposure assessment in the aftermath of a large-scale disaster. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, comparative review of mental health triage data collected with the PsySTART system from survivors of the September 2009 earthquake-tsunami in American Samoa. Data were obtained from two sources--secondary triage of patients and a standardized community assessment survey-and analyzed descriptively. The main outcome measures were survivor-reported traumatic experiences and exposures--called triage factors--associated with risk for developing severe distress and new mental health disorders following disasters. RESULTS: The most common triage factors reported by survivors referred for mental health services were ""felt extreme panic/fear"" (93%) and ""felt direct threat to life"" (93%). The most common factor reported by persons in tsunami-affected communities was ""felt extreme panic or fear"" (75%). Proportions of severe triage factors reported by persons living in the community were consistently lower than those reported by patients referred for mental health services. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of evidence-based mental health triage and community assessment gave hospital-based providers, local public health officials, and federal response teams a strategy to match limited clinical resources with survivors at greatest risk. Also, it produced a common operating picture of acute and chronic mental health needs among disaster systems of care operating in American Samoa."
The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and of the Middle East Syndrome Cornavirus (MERS-CoV) caused widespread fear and concern for their potential threat to global health security. There are similarities and differences in the epidemiology and clinical features between these two diseases. The origin of SARS-COV and MERS-CoV is thought to be an animal source with subsequent transmission to humans. The identification of both the intermediate host and the exact route of transmission of MERS-CoV is crucial for the subsequent prevention of the introduction of the virus into the human population. So far MERS-CoV had resulted in a limited travel-associated human cases with no major events related to the Hajj.
"Generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD) is associated with heightened limbic and prefrontal activation to negative social cues conveying threat (e.g. fearful faces), but less is known about brain response to negative non-threatening social stimuli. The neuropeptide oxytocin (Oxt) has been shown to attenuate (and normalize) fear-related brain activation and reactivity to emotionally negative cues. Here, we examined the effects of intranasal Oxt on cortical activation to non-threatening sad faces in patients with GSAD and matched controls (Con). In a double-blind placebo-controlled within-subjects design, the cortical activation to sad and happy (vs. neutral) faces was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging following acute intranasal administration of 24 IU Oxt and placebo. Relative to the Con group, GSAD patients exhibited heightened activity to sad faces in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC/BA 10) extending into anterior cingulate cortex (ACC/BA 32). Oxt significantly reduced this heightened activation in the mPFC/ACC regions to levels similar to that of controls. These findings suggest that GSAD is associated with cortical hyperactivity to non-threatening negative but not positive social cues and that Oxt attenuates this exaggerated cortical activity. The modulation of cortical activity by Oxt highlights a broader mechanistic role of this neuropeptide in modulating socially negative cues in GSAD."
"The less disabling phobias do not normally present a problem in that the stimulus may be avoided. This would also apply to hospital phobia until an acute medical or surgical problem might arise, when avoidance could constitute a direct threat to life. Although phobic illness is a common problem the small number of cases of hospital phobia recorded may represent the tip of the iceberg beneath which could be many phobic patients who deny their symptoms and risk their health because of their irrational fear. A case of hopsital phobia in a pregnant patient with suspected disproportion was treated by a rapid desensitization technique using hypnosis. After five sessions of 30 min each, the patient was symptom free. This simple method of desensitization, if more widely known would considerably minimize the risk caused by concealment of the phobic problem."
"AIM: This paper discusses issues central to emotional expression in illness. Its aim is to challenge the psychopathological paradigm currently utilized within healthcare and propose an alternative model based on healthy emotions. BACKGROUND: Emotions are important to human survival. It is argued that most patients will have an emotional response to their illness but anxiety and depression are unlikely to be representative of most patients experience. The paper focuses on two important negative emotions, fear and sadness, and their psychopathological associates, anxiety and depression. Problems of diagnosing anxiety and depression in practice are highlighted. It is contended that emotional reaction to illness is normal and that emotions expressed are likely to hold clues to individual adaptation. It is argued that in health care, emotions should be assessed as healthy reactions to a survival threat and merit study from this perspective if we wish to understand individual patient illness reaction and adaptation better. Literature from cardiology is used to illustrate clinical problems. RATIONALE: Given the present knowledge of emotions, it should be possible to utilize emotion theory as a paradigm for studying human reaction to illness. This in turn could help shape studies on adherence and adaptation. CONCLUSION: The reaction and experience of patient illness is unlikely to be understood through the psychopathology paradigm. A better understanding of patient reaction to their illness is more likely to emerge through the study of basic emotions during acute life-threatening episodes."
"Adolescence is the transition from childhood to adulthood, with onset marked by puberty and the offset by relative independence from parents. Across species, it is a time of incredible change that carries increased risks and rewards. The ability of the individual to respond adequately to the mental, physical and emotional stresses of life during this time is a function of both their early environment and their present state. In this article, we focus on the effects that acute threat and chronic stress have on the brain and behavior in humans and rodents. First, we highlight developmental changes in frontolimbic function as healthy individuals transition into and out of adolescence. Second, we examine genetic factors that may enhance susceptibility to stress in one individual over another using translation from genetic mouse models to human neuroimaging. Third, we examine how the timing and nature of stress varies in its impact on brain and behavior. These findings are discussed in the context of implications for adolescent mental health and illness."
"Limb movement imparts a perturbation to the body. The impact of that perturbation is limited via anticipatory postural adjustments. The strategy by which the CNS controls anticipatory postural adjustments of the trunk muscles during limb movement is altered during acute back pain and in people with recurrent back pain, even when they are pain free. The altered postural strategy probably serves to protect the spine in the short term, but it is associated with a cost and is thought to predispose spinal structures to injury in the long term. It is not known why this protective strategy might occur even when people are pain free, but one possibility is that it is caused by the anticipation of back pain. In eight healthy subjects, recordings of intramuscular EMG were made from the trunk muscles during single and repetitive arm movements. Anticipation of experimental back pain and anticipation of experimental elbow pain were elicited by the threat of painful cutaneous stimulation. There was no effect of anticipated experimental elbow pain on postural adjustments. During anticipated experimental back pain, for single arm movements there was delayed activation of the deep trunk muscles and augmentation of at least one superficial trunk muscle. For repetitive arm movements, there was decreased activity and a shift from biphasic to monophasic activation of the deep trunk muscles and increased activity of superficial trunk muscles during anticipation of back pain. In both instances, the changes were consistent with adoption of an altered strategy for postural control and were similar to those observed in patients with recurrent back pain. We conclude that anticipation of experimental back pain evokes a protective postural strategy that stiffens the spine. This protective strategy is associated with compressive cost and is thought to predispose to spinal injury if maintained long term."
"In studies employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), reactivity of the amygdala to threat-related sensory cues (viz., facial displays of negative emotion) has been found to correlate positively with interindividual variability in testosterone levels of women and young men and to increase on acute administration of exogenous testosterone. Many of the biological actions of testosterone are mediated by intracellular androgen receptors (ARs), which exert transcriptional control of androgen-dependent genes and are expressed in various regions of the brain, including the amygdala. Transactivation potential of the AR decreases (yielding relative androgen insensitivity) with expansion a polyglutamine stretch in the N-terminal domain of the AR protein, as encoded by a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat polymorphism in exon 1 of the X-chromosome AR gene. Here we examined whether amygdala reactivity to threat-related facial expressions (fear, anger) differs as a function of AR CAG length variation and endogenous (salivary) testosterone in a mid-life sample of 41 healthy men (mean age=45.6 years, range: 34-54 years; CAG repeats, range: 19-29). Testosterone correlated inversely with participant age (r=-0.39, p=0.012) and positively with number of CAG repeats (r=0.45, p=0.003). In partial correlations adjusted for testosterone level, reactivity in the ventral amygdala was lowest among men with largest number of CAG repeats. This inverse association was seen in both the right (r(p)=-0.34, p<0.05) and left (r(p)=-0.32, p<0.05) hemisphere. Activation of dorsal amygdala, correlated positively with individual differences in salivary testosterone, also in right (r=0.40, p<0.02) and left (r=0.32, p<0.05) hemisphere, but was not affected by number of CAG repeats. Hence, androgenic influences on threat-related reactivity in the ventral amygdala may be moderated partially by CAG length variation in the AR gene. Because individual differences in salivary testosterone also predicted dorsal amygdala reactivity and did so independently of CAG repeats, it is suggested that androgenic influences within this anatomically distinct region may be mediated, in part, by non-genomic or AR-independent mechanisms."
"INTRODUCTION: Voice communication may enhance performance during monotonous, potentially fatiguing driving conditions (Atchley & Chan, 2011); however, it is unclear whether safety benefits of conversation are outweighed by costs. The present study tested whether personalized conversations intended to simulate hands-free cell phone conversation may counter objective and subjective fatigue effects elicited by vehicle automation. METHOD: A passive fatigue state (Desmond & Hancock, 2001), characterized by disengagement from the task, was induced using full vehicle automation prior to drivers resuming full control over the driving simulator. A conversation was initiated shortly after reversion to manual control. During the conversation an emergency event occurred. RESULTS: The fatigue manipulation produced greater task disengagement and slower response to the emergency event, relative to a control condition. Conversation did not mitigate passive fatigue effects; rather, it added worry about matters unrelated to the driving task. Conversation moderately improved vehicle control, as measured by SDLP, but it failed to counter fatigue-induced slowing of braking in response to an emergency event. Finally, conversation appeared to have a hidden danger in that it reduced drivers' insights into performance impairments when in a state of passive fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Automation induced passive fatigue, indicated by loss of task engagement; yet, simulated cell phone conversation did not counter the subjective automation-induced fatigue. Conversation also failed to counter objective loss of performance (slower braking speed) resulting from automation. Cell phone conversation in passive fatigue states may impair drivers' awareness of their performance deficits. Practical applications: Results suggest that conversation, even using a hands-free device, may not be a safe way to reduce fatigue and increase alertness during transitions from automated to manual vehicle control."
"Objective: To compare the knowledge and behavior toward hearing protection among workers in different workplaces and investigate its influence factors. Methods: 2 manufacturing companies with obvious noise hazard in workplace were selected into the study. Health management level was distinguished through field investigation and verification. Questionnaire focus on basic knowledge of hearing health, acceptance level of noise hazard, comfort of wearing hearing protectors and atmosphere in workplace was designed and was used to investigate the knowledge and behavior toward hearing protection. Results: Hearing protectors that meet the level of protection are distributed throughout the workplaces. Although company A has a lower noise hazards level, the health management system was poorly executed. The proportion of workers persisting in wearing hearing protectors throughout the work shift in company A was lower than B (P<0.01) . Workers in company A intended to underestimate the noise level (P<0.01) and the health effect of hearing loss (P<0.01) . All the workers were worry about suffering from hearing loss (P>0.05) , but those in company B had more positive attitude toward the protection of hearing protector (P<0.01) and relied on the protector (P<0.01) . The awareness of protection, in turn, help workers adapt attitude and get used to wearing hearing protectors consciously in workplace (P<0.01) . Conclusion: Health management performance play a key role in help workers form good knowledge and behavior. To protect workplace health, employers need to creative a healthy supportive environment for workers."
"PURPOSE: To describe women's early pregnancy after loss experiences (up to 25 weeks gestation), to document the timing and frequency of their common discomforts and events, and to explore changes in these over time. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal, qualitative descriptive, and triangulated (data, methods, analyses). METHODS: Qualitative data were collected from 82 women pregnant after a past perinatal loss, who were followed through their 25th week gestation. Field notes were taken on all women; 75 women recorded events of their pregnancy through text and stickers on an investigator-supplied calendar. Thematic analysis was done from field notes and hand-written calendar entries; content analysis was conducted on sticker-entered events and symptoms. RESULTS: Themes identified in the data were Growing Confident, Fluctuating Worry, Interpreting Signs, Managing Pregnancy, and Having Dreams. The first four themes comprise the see-saw nature of these pregnancies. Managing Pregnancy includes the subthemes of Being Hypervigilant, Seeking Reassurance, and Relying on Internal Beliefs. The theme of Having Dreams was a serendipitous finding, in the sense that women reported their dreams without prompting, but the data did not reach saturation. Future research in this area is suggested. Calendar stickers indicate that fatigue and headaches are the most commonly reported discomforts. Fetal movement, felt by all the women by 25 weeks gestation, was very reassuring. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Nurses should understand that women who have experienced a previous pregnancy loss have omnipresent worry and anxiety during a subsequent pregnancy, and seek reassurance that their pregnancy and baby are okay. Therefore, the frequent calls and visits to healthcare providers from these women represent their most common and comforting way of coping with their worry."
"BACKGROUND: Effective prevention and care for type 2 diabetes requires that people link healthy behaviours to chronic disease-related wellbeing. This study explored how people perceive current and future wellbeing, so as to inform lifestyle education. METHODS: Eight focus group discussions and 12 in-depth interviews were conducted in Iganga and Mayuge districts in rural Eastern Uganda among people aged 35-60 years in three risk categories (1) People with diabetes, (2) people at higher risk of diabetes (with hypertension or overweight) and (3) community members without diabetes. RESULTS: People define wellbeing in three notions: 1) Physical health, 2) Socio-economic status and 3) Aspirational fulfilment. Most people hold the narrower view of wellbeing that focuses on absence of pain. Most overweight participants did not feel their condition as affecting their wellbeing. However, for several people with hypertension, the pains they describe indicate probable serious heart disease. Some people with diabetes expressed deep worry and loss of hope, saying that 'thoughts are more bothersome than the illness'. Wellbeing among people with diabetes was described in two perspectives: Those who view diabetes as a 'static' condition think that they cannot attain wellbeing while those who view it as a 'dynamic' condition think that with consistent treatment and healthy lifestyles, they can be well. While many participants perceive future wellbeing as important, people without diabetes are less concerned about it than those with diabetes. Inadequate knowledge about diabetes, drug stock-outs in health facilities, unaffordable healthier food, and contradictory information were cited as barriers to future wellbeing in people with diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: To make type 2 diabetes prevention relevant to healthy people, health education messages should link current lifestyles to future wellbeing. Diabetes patients need counselling support, akin to that in HIV care, to address deep worry and loss of hope."
"Patients with HCV infection have reduced work productivity (WP), in terms of both presenteeism (impairment in work productivity while working) and absenteeism (productivity loss due to absence from work). The aim of this study was to identify clinical and patient-reported factors that are predictive of WP in HCV-infected patients. HCV-infected patients enrolled in clinical trials completed 3 PRO questionnaires (CLDQ-HCV, SF-36 and FACIT-F) and one work productivity (WPAI:SHP) questionnaire. In employed subjects, work productivity and its absenteeism and presenteeism components were calculated using WPAI:SHP instrument. Of 4121 HCV-infected patients with work productivity data, 2480 (60.2%) reported to be employed, and of those, 2190 had completed all PRO questionnaires before treatment initiation. Of the study cohort, 519/2190 (23.7%) had severe work impairment. In multiple linear regression analysis, work productivity was predicted by lower scores in activity/energy domain of CLDQ-HCV, physical well-being domain of FACIT-F, worry domain of CLDQ-HCV and role physical domain of SF-36 (all P < 0.0005). Furthermore, presenteeism was independently predicted by the activity/energy of CLDQ-HCV, physical well-being of FACIT-F, worry domain of CLDQ-HCV, role physical scale of SF-36 and fatigue scale of FACIT-F (P < 0.002). Finally, absenteeism was independently predicted by physical well-being scale of FACIT-F and role physical scale of SF-36 (all P < 0.002). Clinically, work productivity impairment was predicted by the presence of cirrhosis, anxiety, depression and clinically overt fatigue (P < 0.01). Thus, the most important drivers of WP in HCV are impairment of physical aspects of PROs and clinical history of depression, anxiety, fatigue and cirrhosis."
"BACKGROUND: Patient portals have shown promise in engaging individuals in self-management of chronic conditions by allowing patients to input and track health information and exchange secure electronic messages with their providers. Past studies have identified patient barriers to portal use including usability issues, low health literacy, and concerns about loss of personal contact as well as provider concerns such as increased time spent responding to messages. However, to date, studies of both patient and provider perspectives on portal use have focused on the pre-implementation or initial implementation phases and do not consider how these issues may change as patients and providers gain greater experience with portals. OBJECTIVE: Our study examined the following research question: Within primary care offices with high rates of patient-portal use, what do experienced physician and patient users of the ambulatory portal perceive as the benefits and challenges of portal use in general and secure messaging in particular? METHODS: This qualitative study involved 42 interviews with experienced physician and patient users of an ambulatory patient portal, Epic's MyChart. Participants were recruited from the Department of Family Medicine at a large Academic Medical Center (AMC) and included providers and their patients, who had been diagnosed with at least one chronic condition. A total of 29 patients and 13 primary care physicians participated in the interviews. All interviews were conducted by telephone and followed a semistructured interview guide. Interviews were transcribed verbatim to permit rigorous qualitative analysis. Both inductive and deductive methods were used to code and analyze the data iteratively, paying particular attention to themes involving secure messaging. RESULTS: Experienced portal users discussed several emergent themes related to a need for greater clarity on when and how to use the secure messaging feature. Patient concerns included worry about imposing on their physician's time, the lack of provider compensation for responding to secure messages, and uncertainty about when to use secure messaging to communicate with their providers. Similarly, providers articulated a lack of clarity as to the appropriate way to communicate via MyChart and suggested that additional training for both patients and providers might be important. Patient training could include orienting patients to the ""rules of engagement"" at portal sign-up, either in the office or through an online tutorial. CONCLUSIONS: As secure messaging through patient portals is increasingly being used as a method of physician-patient communication, both patients and providers are looking for guidance on how to appropriately engage with each other using this tool. Patients worry about whether their use is appropriate, and providers are concerned about the content of messages, which allow them to effectively manage patient questions. Our findings suggest that additional training may help address the concerns of both patients and providers, by providing ""rules of engagement"" for communication via patient portals."
"Timely follow-up for positive cancer screening results remains suboptimal, and the evidence base to inform decisions on optimizing the timeliness of diagnostic testing is unclear. This systematic review evaluated published studies regarding time to follow-up after a positive screening for breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancers. The quality of available evidence was very low or low across cancers, with potential attenuated or reversed associations from confounding by indication in most studies. Overall, evidence suggested that the risk for poorer cancer outcomes rises with longer wait times that vary within and across cancer types, which supports performing diagnostic testing as soon as feasible after the positive result, but evidence for specific time targets is limited. Within these limitations, we provide our opinion on cancer-specific recommendations for times to follow-up and how existing guidelines relate to the current evidence. Thresholds set should consider patient worry, potential for loss to follow-up with prolonged wait times, and available resources. Research is needed to better guide the timeliness of diagnostic follow-up, including considerations for patient preferences and existing barriers, while addressing methodological weaknesses. Research is also needed to identify effective interventions for reducing wait times for diagnostic testing, particularly in underserved or low-resource settings. CA Cancer J Clin 2018;68:199-216.

"OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the psychosocial aspects of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy in Japan. METHODS: The subjects were 16 patients who underwent risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy at the Cancer Institute Hospital. Worry about cancer, emotional state and cancer-specific distress level were evaluated using a four-point Likert scale, the Profile of Mood States-Short Form and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, respectively, before and 1 year after the surgery. In addition, the subjects were interviewed regarding their expectation for the risk-reducing surgery, the effects of the surgery, and the recovery from surgery, before the surgery and at 1, 6 and 12 months after the surgery. A t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for the analysis, and literal analects were prepared for the interview and the answers were organized per question item using NVIVO10. RESULTS: The results revealed that the total score for worry about breast cancer and ovarian cancer (P = 0.021) as well as the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (P = 0.021) were significantly lower 1 year after surgery, compared with the values before the surgery. Regarding the preoperative expectations for the surgery, the expectation for reducing the cancer risk was the highest. The reported effects of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy on life included the appearance of menopausal symptoms, a loss of motivation and poor concentration; more effects were reported at 1 year after surgery than at 6 months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy can be effective for reducing worry about breast cancer and ovarian cancer and cancer-specific distress as well as contributing to a reduction in mortality from fallopian tube and ovarian related cancer."
"CASE: Zoe, a 13-year-old white girl, presents as a new patient to your pediatric clinic with complaints of frequent emesis, anxiety, and learning problems, and previous diagnosis of cerebellar ataxia. Parents accompany Zoe and state, ""it is really hard for her to go out, she gets sick and falls easily."" She was born full term by vaginal delivery without complications. Given globally delayed milestones, she received early intervention services. Feeding problems began at infancy, including gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration pneumonia.At age 2, Zoe saw a neurologist and brain MRI revealed cerebellar atrophy. She recently saw a geneticist and genetic studies are pending. Parents report receiving ""little"" information regarding prognosis; through their own research, they read about individuals having similar symptoms in adulthood, with a degenerative pattern. They worry that Zoe is ""still very young and we do not know what her future will be like.""Despite ongoing speech and feeding challenges, the parents report difficulty finding a speech and language therapist in their area. Zoe does see an otolaryngologist for frequent otitis media and hearing loss and an ophthalmologist for vision problems. Still, she continues to fall further behind in school. Furthermore, she is intensely afraid of falling at school and has few friends, resulting in the family being at a loss regarding ""what to do about school.""She lives with both parents and 2 healthy older sisters. Her mother has Crohn's disease and has been unable to work. Her maternal aunt is close to Zoe and has hypothyroidism. Her father works as an insurance agent and resources have been ""tight."" Zoe's mother describes ""making"" Zoe go out to the movies, ""otherwise she just stays home."" Zoe usually needs assistance to walk in public, to keep from stumbling. Parents share that simply being in a public place or meeting a new physician may trigger emesis. Zoe does enjoy interacting with neighborhood children and says she wants to be ""normal,"" wear nail polish, and date. She seeks independence, often refusing to use her wheelchair. Parents feel she requires more intensive occupational and physical therapy.On examination, she is very slender with hypertelorism and nystagmus. Holding an emesis bag, she gags intermittently, producing clear secretions. She has a notable tremor and walks slightly stooped with wide-based gait. Her few words demonstrate articulation differences and cognitive expression characteristic of a younger child. She wears light make-up and age-appropriate clothes. She asks, ""When can I go home?""At the end of the visit, parents share their worry that Zoe is ""so young and we do not know anything, what to expect, or what to tell her."" As the family's new medical home, they ask you to weigh in on what to do next to best support her? Where do you begin?"
"Increasing efforts have been made to investigate the underlying pathophysiology of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), but only limited consistent information is available on gray (GM) and white matter (WM) volume changes in affected adults. Additionally, few studies employed dimensional approaches to GAD pathology. This study compares structural brain imaging data from n=19 GAD subjects and n=24 healthy comparison (HC) subjects, all medication-free and matched on age, sex and education. Separate categorical and dimensional models were employed using voxel-based morphometry for GM and WM. Significantly higher GM volumes were found in GAD subjects mainly in basal ganglia structures and less consistently in the superior temporal pole. For WM, GAD subjects showed significantly lower volumes in the dlPFC. Largely consistent findings in dimensional and categorical models point toward these structural alterations being reliable and of importance for GAD. While lower volume in the dlPFC could reflect impaired emotional processing and control over worry in GAD, basal ganglia alterations may be linked to disturbed gain and loss anticipation as implicated in previous functional GAD studies. As perturbations in anticipation processes are central to GAD, these areas may warrant greater attention in future studies."
"In the study presented here, we describe our efforts to develop and validate a new measurement tool for perimenopausal menstrual blood loss. We validate this simple-to-use, subjective pencil-and-paper scale, the Mansfield-Voda-Jorgensen Menstrual Bleeding Scale (MVJ), against an objective measure, the weight of used menstrual products. Thirty-one women from the Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN region saved all their used products over three menstrual cycles, storing them in airtight zip bags, and rated their menstrual fluid volume loss using the MVJ. The overall correlation between MVJ scores and log discharge rate was quite high (r = 0.683); all MVJ categories were statistically unique with the exception of categories ""1"" and ""2."" The overall fit, then, was particularly good at the heavy bleeding end of the scale. When five women with poor performance were removed, the correlations ranged from 0.480-0.894. The MVJ is a promising tool for identifying women with excessive menstrual bleeding. It is a simple-to-use, pencil-and-paper scale that offers an inexpensive and practical method to clinicians who work with perimenopausal women, the group most vulnerable to unnecessary worry and/or interventions when menorrhagia is incorrectly diagnosed."
"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Very low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LC) diets are used for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) management, but their effects on psychological health remain largely unknown. This study examined the long-term effects of an LC diet on psychological health. METHODS: One hundred and fifteen obese adults [age: 58.5 +/- 7.1 years; body mass index: 34.6 +/- 4.3 kg m(-2) ; HbA1c : 7.3 +/- 1.1%] with T2DM were randomized to consume either an energy-restricted (~6 to 7 MJ), planned isocaloric LC or high-carbohydrate, low-fat (HC) diet, combined with a supervised exercise programme (3 days week(-1) ) for 1 year. Body weight, psychological mood state and well-being [Profile of Mood States (POMS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (SAI)] and diabetes-specific emotional distress [Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) Questionnaire] and quality of life [QoL Diabetes-39 (D-39)] were assessed. RESULTS: Overall weight loss was 9.5 +/- 0.5 kg (mean +/- SE), with no difference between groups (P = 0.91 time x diet). Significant improvements occurred in BDI, POMS (total mood disturbance and the six subscales of anger-hostility, confusion-bewilderment, depression-dejection, fatigue-inertia, vigour-activity and tension-anxiety), PAID (total score) and the D-39 dimensions of diabetes control, anxiety and worry, sexual functioning and energy and mobility, P < 0.05 time. SAI and the D-39 dimension of social burden remained unchanged (P >/= 0.08 time). Diet composition had no effect on the responses for the outcomes assessed (P >/= 0.22 time x diet). CONCLUSION: In obese adults with T2DM, both diets achieved substantial weight loss and comparable improvements in QoL, mood state and affect. These results suggest that either an LC or HC diet within a lifestyle modification programme that includes exercise training improves psychological well-being."
"BACKGROUND: There is a need for studies that follow up children and adolescents for many years post disaster since earlier studies have shown that exposure during natural disasters constitutes a risk factor for poor psychological health. AIMS: The main aim was to examine whether there was an association between severity of exposures during a natural disaster experienced in childhood or adolescence and posttraumatic stress symptoms, psychological distress, self-rated health, diagnosis of depression, anxiety or worry, thoughts about or attempted suicide, physical symptoms or daily functioning eight years later in young adulthood. A second aim was to compare psychological distress and self-rated health of exposed young adults with a matched population-based sample. METHOD: Young adults, who experienced the 2004 tsunami as children between 10 and 15 years of age, responded to a questionnaire eight years post disaster. The results were compared to a matched population sample. RESULTS: The results showed that the likelihood for negative psychological outcomes was higher for those who had been exposed to several types of exposures during this natural disaster. CONCLUSIONS: The negative psychological impact on children and adolescents can still be present eight years post-disaster and seems to have association with the type of exposure; loss, physical presence and subjective experience. It is important for clinicians, who meet young adults seeking help, to be conscious about the impact as long as eight years post disaster and to be aware of possible clinical implications associated with severity of exposures."
"Many low-income countries need to substantially increase expenditure to meet universal coverage goals for essential health services but, because they have very low-incomes, most will be unable to raise adequate funds exclusively from domestic sources in the short to medium term. Increased aid for health will be required. However, there has long been a concern that the rapid arrival of large amounts of foreign exchange in a country could lead to an increase in inflation and loss of international competitiveness, with an adverse impact on exports and economic growth, an economic phenomenon termed 'Dutch disease'. We review cross-country and country-level empirical studies and propose a simple framework to gauge the extent of macroeconomic risks. Of the 15 low-income countries that are increasing aid-financed health spending, 7 have high macroeconomic risks that may constrain the sustained expansion of spending. These conditions also apply in one-quarter of the 42 countries not presently increasing spending. Health authorities should be aware of the multiple risk factors at play, including factors that are health-sector specific and others that generally are not. They should also realize that there are effective means for mitigating the risk of Dutch disease associated with increasing development assistance for health. International partners also have an important role to play since more sustainable and predictable flows of donor funding will allow more productivity enhancing investment in physical and human capital, which will also contribute to ensuring there are few harmful macroeconomic effects of increases in aid."
"PURPOSE: The exchange from a non-tunneled hemodialysis catheter to a tunneled one over a guidewire using a previous venotomy has been reported to be safe. However, some concerns that it may increase infection risk prevent its clinical application. This approach seems particularly useful for acute kidney injury patients requiring initial renal replacement therapy, in whom we frequently worry about the choice of non-tunneled versus tunneled catheters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 2012 to February 2016, 88 cases to receive the over-the-guidewire exchange method from a non-tunneled to a tunneled catheter and 521 cases to receive de novo tunneled catheter placement from the hemodialysis vascular access cohort were compared retrospectively. RESULTS: The immediate complication, later catheter dysfunction requiring replacement, and infection rates were comparable between the two groups. Newly placed tunneled catheter survival in the over-the-guidewire exchange group was comparable with survival in the de novo tunneled catheter group (p = 0.24). In addition, when we compared the same two methods among only intensive care unit patients; they remained similar (p = 0.19). CONCLUSION: An exchange with the over-the-guidewire method from a non-tunneled to a tunneled catheter was comparable to a de novo catheter placement technique. Therefore, this method should be viewed more favorably and should especially be considered for acute kidney injury patients."
"Galen describes a syndrome he associates with an emotion called lype, with specific symptoms and a course that may lead to humoral imbalance, disease, and death. Lype is an emotion that encompasses distress at a loss, as the death of a close friend or the destruction of one's books by fire; but Galen also associates it with chronic worry about a future threat, and a physiology between the emotions of worry and fear (that is, 'anxiety'). Lype can cause a progressive syndrome characterised by insomnia, fever, pallor, and weight loss that can kill patients or degenerate into psychotic illness. This syndrome can be described in modern terms as an anxiety disorder."
"OBJECTIVE: This review is an update for the US Preventive Services Task Force on universal newborn hearing screening to detect moderate-to-severe permanent, bilateral congenital hearing loss. We focus on 3 key questions: (1) Among infants identified by universal screening who would not be identified by targeted screening, does initiating treatment before 6 months of age improve language and communication outcomes? (2) Compared with targeted screening, does universal screening increase the chance that treatment will be initiated by 6 months of age for infants at average risk or for those at high risk? (3) What are the adverse effects of screening and early treatment? METHODS: Medline and Cochrane databases were searched to identify articles published since the 2002 recommendation. Data from studies that met inclusion criteria were abstracted, and studies were rated for quality with predetermined criteria. RESULTS: A good-quality retrospective study of children with hearing loss indicates that those who had early versus late confirmation and those who had undergone universal newborn screening versus none had better receptive language at 8 years of age but not better expressive language or speech. A good-quality nonrandomized trial of a large birth cohort indicates that infants identified with hearing loss through universal newborn screening have earlier referral, diagnosis, and treatment than those not screened. These findings are corroborated by multiple descriptive studies of ages of referral, diagnosis, and treatment. Usual parental reactions to an initial nonpass on a hearing screen include worry, questioning, and distress that resolve for most parents. Cochlear implants have been associated with higher risks for bacterial meningitis in young children. CONCLUSIONS: Children with hearing loss who had universal newborn hearing screening have better language outcomes at school age than those not screened. Infants identified with hearing loss through universal screening have significantly earlier referral, diagnosis, and treatment than those identified in other ways."
"OBJECTIVES: Women at increased genetic risk of ovarian cancer (OC) are recommended to have risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) after completion of reproductive planning. Effective screening has not been established, and novel screening modalities are being evaluated. METHODS: Participants chose either RRSO or a novel OC screening regimen (OCS) as their risk management option, and provided demographic and other data on BRCA mutation status, cancer worry, perceived intervention risks/benefits, perceived cancer risk, and quality-of-life at enrollment. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses to evaluate factors influencing decision between RRSO and OCS. RESULTS: Of 2287 participants enrolled, 904 (40%) chose RRSO and 1383 (60%) chose OCS. Compared with participants choosing OCS, participants choosing RRSO were older (p<0.0001), more likely to carry deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations (p<0.0001), perceive RRSO as effective, be more concerned about surgical harms and OCS limitations, and report higher perceived OC risk and OC-related worry. OCS participants were more likely to perceive screening as effective, be more concerned about menopausal symptoms, infertility, and loss of femininity, and report better overall quality-of-life. Twenty-four percent of participants believed they would definitely develop OC, and half estimated their lifetime OC risk as >50%, both higher than objective risk estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer worry, BRCA1/2 mutation status, and perceived intervention-related risks and benefits were associated with choosing between RRSO and OCS. Efforts to promote individualized, evidence-based, shared medical decision-making among high-risk women facing management choices should focus on conveying accurate OC risk estimates, clarifying the current understanding of intervention-related benefits and limitations, and addressing OC worry."
"PURPOSE: Small reductions in body weight can decrease osteoarthritic knee pain. Intuitively this should provide a strong incentive for weight-loss. However many people undergoing knee joint replacement (KJR) are categorised as obese. Gender theories can help us to understand differential responses to illness and therefore make an important contribution to rehabilitation. We aimed to explore barriers to weight loss in a group of older men with osteoarthritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted 12 in-depth interviews, before and 1 year after surgery, with six obese men listed for KJR. Analysis was influenced by constructivist grounded theory. We abstracted conceptual themes from the data through constant comparison. RESULTS: We identified the following themes: (1) I am big and healthy and don't need to lose weight; (2) being this size isn't good for me; (3) men don't have to worry about that sort of thing; (4) I am not as active as I used to be; (5) I have worked hard all my life; (6) what is the point in trying anyway? CONCLUSIONS: Gendered narratives can make it challenging for men to lose weight. Healthcare professionals cannot ignore the influence of gender on rehabilitation and should consider gender specific strategies. Implications for rehabilitation Men may not associate being overweight with being unhealthy. Men may take pride in being in good shape and may respond better to weight loss strategies that focus on fitness not body size. Men may link weight gain with decrease in activity levels rather than overeating. Health care professionals should challenge the assumption that weight loss will follow surgery. Health care professionals cannot ignore the influence of gender on the success of rehabilitation."
"CONTEXT: Cachexia is commonly found in cancer patients and has profound consequences; yet there is only one questionnaire that examines the patient's perspective. OBJECTIVE: To report a rigorously developed module for patient self-reported impact of cancer cachexia. METHODS: Module development followed published guidelines. Patients from across the cancer cachexia trajectory were included. In Phase 1, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) issues were generated from a literature review and interviews with patients in four countries. The issues were revised based on patient and health care professional (HCP) input. In Phase 2, questionnaire items were formulated and translated into the languages required for Phase 3, the pilot phase, in which patients from eight countries scored the relevance and importance of each item, and provided qualitative feedback. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients and 12 HCPs took part in Phase 1. The literature review produced 68 HRQOL issues, with 22 new issues arising from the patient interviews. After patient and HCP input, 44 issues were formulated into questionnaire items in Phase 2. One hundred ten patients took part in Phase 3. One item was reworded, and 20 items were deleted as a consequence of patient feedback. CONCLUSIONS: The QLQ-CAX24 is a cancer cachexia-specific questionnaire, comprising 24 items, for HRQOL assessment in clinical trials and practice. It contains five multi-item scales (food aversion, eating and weight-loss worry, eating difficulties, loss of control, and physical decline) and four single items."
"Changes in how campuses respond to sexual assault under Title IX may dramatically alter the experiences of survivors and the roles of responders. This exploratory study examines how the roles of campus-based sexual assault victim advocates are changing and the effects on advocacy and survivors. Although most advocates agree that Title IX has increased awareness and reporting of sexual assault, they are concerned about the loss of confidential outlets for reporting, conflicts with other responders, and devaluation of their role. Some advocates see professionalization as a solution, whereas others worry that professionalization might negatively affect their ability to serve survivors."
"IMPORTANCE: This study provides further evidence from a national sample to generalize the relationship between depression and vision loss to adults across the age spectrum. Better recognition of depression among people reporting reduced ability to perform routine activities of daily living due to vision loss is warranted. OBJECTIVES: To estimate, in a national survey of US adults 20 years of age or older, the prevalence of depression among adults reporting visual function loss and among those with visual acuity impairment. The relationship between depression and vision loss has not been reported in a nationally representative sample of US adults. Previous studies have been limited to specific cohorts and predominantly focused on the older population. DESIGN: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2008. SETTING: A cross-sectional, nationally representative sample of adults, with prevalence estimates weighted to represent the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 10 480 US adults 20 years of age or older. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression, as measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale, and vision loss, as measured by visual function using a questionnaire and by visual acuity at examination. RESULTS: In 2005-2008, the estimated crude prevalence of depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire score of >/=10) was 11.3% (95% CI, 9.7%-13.2%) among adults with self-reported visual function loss and 4.8% (95% CI, 4.0%-5.7%) among adults without. The estimated prevalence of depression was 10.7% (95% CI, 8.0%-14.3%) among adults with presenting visual acuity impairment (visual acuity worse than 20/40 in the better-seeing eye) compared with 6.8% (95% CI, 5.8%-7.8%) among adults with normal visual acuity. After controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, living alone or not, education, income, employment status, health insurance, body mass index, smoking, binge drinking, general health status, eyesight worry, and major chronic conditions, self-reported visual function loss remained significantly associated with depression (overall odds ratio, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.6-2.3]), whereas the association between presenting visual acuity impairment and depression was no longer statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Self-reported visual function loss, rather than loss of visual acuity, is significantly associated with depression. Health professionals should be aware of the risk of depression among persons reporting visual function loss."
"BACKGROUND: A large proportion of the patients with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma are young women. Therefore, minimally invasive endoscopic thyroidectomy with central neck dissection (CND) emerged and showed well-accepted results with improved cosmetic outcome, accelerated healing, and comforting the patients. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of robotic total thyroidectomy with CND via bilateral axillo-breast approach (BABA), compared with conventional open procedure in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma. METHODS: One-hundred patients with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma from March 2014 to January 2015 in Jinan Military General Hospital of People's Liberation Army (PLA) were randomly assigned to robotic group or conventional open approach group (n = 50 in each group). The total operative time, estimated intraoperative blood loss, numbers of lymph node removed, visual analog scale (VAS), postoperative hospital stay time, complications, and numerical scoring system (NSS, used to assess cosmetic effect) were analyzed. RESULTS: The robotic total thyroidectomy with CND via BABA was successfully performed in robotic group. There were no conversion from the robotic surgeries to open or endoscopic surgery. The subclinical central lymph node metastasis rate was 35%. The mean operative time of the robotic group was longer than that of the conventional open approach group (118.8 +/- 16.5 min vs. 90.7 +/- 10.3 min, P < 0.05). The study showed significant differences between the two groups in terms of the VASs (2.1 +/- 1.0 vs. 3.8 +/- 1.2, P < 0.05) and NSS (8.9 +/- 0.8 vs. 4.8 +/- 1.7, P < 0.05). The differences between the two groups in the estimated intraoperative blood loss, postoperative hospital stay time, numbers of lymph node removed, postoperative thyroglobulin levels, and complications were not statistically significant (all P > 0.05). Neither iatrogenic implantation nor metastasis occurred in punctured porous channel or chest wall in both groups. Postoperative cosmetic results were very satisfactory in the robotic group. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic total thyroidectomy with CND via BABA is safe and effective for Chinese patients with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma who worry about the neck scars."
"The impact of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is not limited to the infection with the BSE agent but also affects psychosocial responses, such as worry and loss of confidence in public authorities. It was shown in past crises that these reactions depended upon the way the event was perceived by the public. Understanding the nature of the perceptions of BSE is therefore of great importance for risk management in all phases of the risk, including the period before the onset of a crisis, when BSE is still only a pending threat to human health. This study analyzed data from a representative national survey of Canadians (n = 1,517) on the perceived risk of prion diseases. Factor analysis revealed emerging dimensions of BSE appraisals and regression analysis identified variables that predicted worry and coping strategies. Results yielded three significant factors, each relating differently to reactions to BSE: (1) Perceived impact, which combined perceived risk for health and likelihood of occurrence of BSE crises, was the main predictor of worry about eating tainted beef; (2) perceived mastery, consisting of personal knowledge and control, predicted taking action to avoid the disease; and (3) perceived intricacy, composed of perceived complexity and uncertainty, uniquely predicted trying to ignore BSE-related risks. Further regression analysis and analysis of variance exposed a moderating role of perceived intricacy on the relationship between perceived impact of BSE crises and worry. The implications of these findings for risk communication and management are described."
"OBJECTIVES: The best model of care for long-term follow-up of survivors of childhood cancer is uncertain. We describe the care experience provided by the joint adult/pediatric AfterCare Clinic at the McMaster Children's Hospital. Secondary outcomes include an evaluation of cancer worry, self-management skills, and loss to follow-up rates. METHODS: AfterCare Clinic patients aged 19-29 years were approached for study participation between January and March 2016. Data were collected from a cross-sectional survey, consisting of the Cancer Care Experience Questionnaire (CCEQ), Cancer Worry Scale (CWS), and Self-Management Skills Scale (SMSS). Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Seventy-three (40%) patients participated in the survey, 17 (23%) anonymously. Demographic characteristics of the nonanonymous participants were representative of the total clinic cohort. Most respondents were satisfied with the quality of care and anticipatory guidance provided, demonstrated by the CCEQ responses. Respondents had a high degree of cancer worries (mean score 50.6 [+/-18.4]), but good self-management skills (72.0 [+/-10.9]). Our 5-year loss to follow-up rate was 3.8%. Sensitivity analyses showed no difference in responses between the total cohort and the nonanonymous participants. CONCLUSIONS: This sample of young adult survivors of childhood cancer had a higher degree of cancer worries and higher self-management skills scores than a younger cohort of survivors of childhood cancer in the literature. Given this, along with the positive care experience reported, and the low loss to follow-up rate, the joint adult/pediatric model of survivorship care appears to be meeting the needs of this population."
"BACKGROUND: Gilbert syndrome (GS) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of bilirubin glucuronidation which has not been investigated in Egypt. This longitudinal study investigated the frequency, clinical course, genetic profile and health related quality of life in Egyptian adults. METHODS: An initial cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the frequency of Gilbert syndrome among Egyptian adults. Subjects fulfilling the criteria of GS were enrolled into the study and prospectively followed for the clinical features, risk factors for hyperbilirubinemia, health related quality of life [Short form-36 Health Survey version 2 (SF-36v2) and Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ)], vitamins assessment and UGT1A1 polymorphisms. RESULTS: One hundred and one subjects fulfilled the criteria of GS with a prevalence of 8.016%. Recurrent jaundice was the only presentation in 47 (56.627%) GS subjects and jaundice was associated with abdominal pain, dyspepsia or loss of appetite in 54 (53.465%) subjects. A significant difference in 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 levels was detected between GS patients and control subjects (P < 00001). Twelve subjects with GS developed significant unconjugated bilirubinemia during direct antiviral therapy (DAAs) therapy for HCV despite achieving sustained virologic response. Pregnancy was associated with significant exacerbation of unconjugated bilirubin which persisted through pregnancy. Risk factors for clinical jaundice included general anesthesia, pregnancy, fasting > 12 h, pregnancy, and low calorie weight losing plans, systemic infections, and intensive physical effort. During jaundice attacks, subjects with GS had significant differences in vitality, role emotional, social functioning, worry and general health domains of the SF-36v2 and CLDQ compared to controls. The homozygous polymorphism A(TA)7TAA was the most frequent polymorphism in Egyptians with GS. CONCLUSION: Gilbert syndrome is a frequent inherited disorder in Egypt. In a substantial percentage of subjects with GS, episodes of jaundice are associated with other symptoms and nutritional deficiencies which result in impairment of HRQOL. Screening, counseling, monitoring and individualized health care are recommended for subjects with GS in the setting of anesthesia, pregnancy, treatment with DAAs, deliveries, surgery and weight loss plans."
"INTRODUCTION: A basal-bolus insulin regimen is needed to achieve glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) below 7.0% in people with type 1 (T1D) or type 2 (T2D) diabetes who have significant loss of beta-cell function. Nonadherence to therapy is common and negatively affects the ability to reach treatment goals. We examined patient assessment of a new, wearable mealtime insulin-delivery system (patch) relative to their current mealtime insulin-delivery system (syringe, pen, or pump). The patch is designed to deliver only boluses of fast-acting insulin (no basal insulin), mechanically controlled by the patient. METHODS: Adults (n = 101) with T1D or T2D assessed their current mealtime insulin-delivery system and then assessed simulated (no active medication) patch use over a 3-day period. Participants evaluated mealtime insulin-delivery systems using eight measures from five domains (convenience, interference with daily activities, diabetes-related worry, psychological well-being, and overall satisfaction/preference) on the self-administered Insulin Delivery System Rating Questionnaire. User ratings of their current insulin-delivery systems (syringe, pen, pump) were compared with those for the patch by repeated measure analysis of variance and one-sample t tests. RESULTS: Participants had significant (p < 0.05) preference for patch over syringe in all eight comparisons, and over pen in five out of eight comparisons, with no significant preference for pen. Although there was a preference for patch over pump in six out of eight comparisons, only one showed a significant preference for patch, and one for pump. Significantly more participants reported that they would like to switch to the patch than continue using a syringe (78% vs 22%) or pen (76% vs 24%) but this difference was not significant for the group using a pump (52% vs 48%). CONCLUSIONS: Participants preferred using the patch over pens and syringes. Its ease of use and discreet method of insulin delivery may contribute to improved patient adherence to mealtime insulin regimens among people currently using injection devices.

"Rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries, which use sulfur as the cathode material, promise great potentials to be the next-generation high-energy system. However, higher-order lithium polysulfides, Li2 Sx (x = 4, 6, and 8), regardless of in charge or in discharge, always form first, dissolve subsequently in the electrolyte, and shuttle to the cathode and the anode, which is called ""shuttle effect."" The polysulfides shuttle effect leads to heavy loss of the active-sulfur materials. Literature works mostly ""cover or fill"" the pores to block polysulfides from shuttling, which also hinder the lithium ion transfer. Here a protocol is invented to grasp polysulfides based on the ""soft and hard acid-base"" theory. Tertiary amine layer (TAL) polymerized on a polypropylene separator selectively coordinates with the dissolved high-order Li2 Sx in the cathode. Meanwhile, the transportation of lithium cations is not interrupted because of enough pores left for their transportation. After 400 cycles of charge/discharge at 0.5C, the TAL modified separator battery still possesses a capacity of 865 mAh g(-1) , which is among the best of the state-of-the-art performances of lithium-sulfur batteries. The flexible ""polysulfides tongs"" construction method paves a new way for Li-S batteries to reach desired performances with less worry about polysulfides shuttle."

"OBJECTIVE: Noise-induced hearing problems among young adults are increasing due to participation in loud activities. This study explored attitudes towards leisure noise, hearing protection, and perceived susceptibility to noise damage in young adults with no diagnosed hearing problems. Understanding attitudes and behaviours will assist with the future development of strategies to improve awareness and use of hearing protection. DESIGN: A qualitative study. STUDY SAMPLE: Four focus groups, with 28 adults aged 18-35 years (6 male; 22 female; mean age 23 years). RESULTS: Using framework analysis, five themes emerged. Earplug use occurred when participants had experienced previous temporary hearing damage (i.e. short-lived tinnitus or hearing loss). Others chose not to use earplugs because music venues are expected to be loud. Peer behaviours and opinions also had a strong influence over earplug use. A lack of knowledge of hearing-related damage resulted in a lack of concern for hearing health and other health conditions taking priority. CONCLUSIONS: The challenge is to present hearing health messages that are relevant and accessible to young adults. Music and entertainment venues must also take greater responsibility to protect the hearing of its customers by at least informing visitors of the dangers of loud music."
"We are astonishingly ignorant about how many species are alive on earth today, and even more ignorant about how many we can lose yet still maintain ecosystem services that humanity ultimately depends upon. Mora et al.'s paper is important in offering an imaginative new approach to assessing total species numbers, both on land and in the sea."
"BACKGROUND: To specify what patients want and worry preoperatively is important in orthopedic practice. The aim of the current study was to analyze the patient characteristics of rotator cuff disease in Korean population who were willing to undergo arthroscopic surgery, and to evaluate the differences in expectations and concerns by age and gender. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 303 patients who underwent rotator cuff surgery between April 2004 and August 2008. Three questionnaires were completed before surgery: the first one addressing preoperative patient's expectation, the second one focusing on concerns by covering 64 items using a visual analogue scale, and the third one evaluating patient's demographic characteristics. The characteristics of preoperative expectation, concern, and demographic data were evaluated according to gender and age group. RESULTS: Female patients had lower level of sports activity (p = 0.007) and lower levels of information (p = 0.028). Gender specific worries are about a caregiver during hospital stay, operating on the working side, fear about ugly scars, postoperative pain, applying makeup or combing hair. The older group responded that they can't be willing to change activities of daily living (p = 0.001), are not living with a spouse (p = 0.002), had previous shoulder operation history (p = 0.008), and had a lower level of information (p = 0.007). They especially worried about medical bills, worried about the physician being too young and inexperienced, postoperative pain, loss of arm function, and hospital food. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed what Korean patients wanted and were concerned about prior to rotator cuff surgery. This can empower patients to formulate realistic expectations and make informed decisions. We feel that we can achieve higher levels of postoperative satisfaction by analyzing expectations and concerns in depth and addressing these proactively."
"PURPOSE: Little research has been done on supportive needs of cancer patients in acute hospitals in Japan. This study aims to comprehensively assess the unmet supportive needs of hospitalized cancer patients, as well as literacy and utilization of appropriate professional care. METHODS: All cancer patients (aged 20 to 80 years) who were hospitalized in a university hospital in Tokyo during the designated 3-day period between September 1 and October 31, 2007 were recruited for participation in the study. The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory, Brief Cancer-Related Worry Inventory, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were administered. Patients' knowledge and use of relevant services were evaluated. The results were compared with those of non-cancer patients in the same treatment settings. RESULTS: A total of 125 cancer patients and 59 non-cancer patients were enrolled. Cancer patients and non-cancer patients equally suffered from physical symptoms (15-26% had severe appetite loss, 18-19% had severe dry mouth, and 16-22% had severe pain); however, psychological distress of cancer patients exceeded that of non-cancer patients (28.0% vs 8.5%; p </= 0.05). Severe psychological distress was associated with severe worry about future prospects or interpersonal and social issues and presence of two or more severe symptoms. Two thirds of the patients with severe psychological distress knew about the psychiatric division, but only one third actually sought treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Needs related to psychological issues were more prevalent among cancer patients than among non-cancer patients, despite a similar level of physical distress. Special attention should be paid to cancer patients who worry over future prospects or interpersonal and social issues, and those who have two or more severe symptoms."
"The lived experiences of elderly dementia patients are affected by their cultural beliefs. This study aims to explore the lived experiences of elderly dementia patients in Taiwan in order to understand how they view their lives given the cognitive impairments that they suffer from. A descriptive phenomenological approach was undertaken in 12 elderly dementia patients who were selected using purposive sampling. Data were analysed using Colaizzi's analysis method. Five main themes emerged from the narratives: (i) distress caused by inability to remember; (ii) counteracting memory loss; (iii) worry about being a burden to family; (iv) cherishing the current situation and gaining respect; and (v) adopting a dispassionate view about life and death. The traditions of filial piety in Chinese culture were reflected in the experiences of these elderly dementia patients. Elderly dementia patients experienced inconveniences in their daily lives due to marked impairments in memory functions, and they even doubted their own independent capabilities. To counteract their disease, many elderly dementia patients developed self-contained approaches to handle their loss of memories. While they were worried about being a burden to their families, they also valued their current situation. They were comforted by being taken care of by their children, and they adopted a dispassionate view about life and death issues. For the care of elderly dementia patients, besides reducing the inconveniences brought about by cognitive impairments, there is also a need to pay attention to the deterioration of their physical bodily functions in order to intervene in their lives holistically."
"STUDY QUESTION: Is there an optimal time to perform ICSI with respect to the times of oocyte pick-up (OPU), in order to maximize the reproductive outcomes in cycles with fresh and vitrified/warmed donor oocytes? SUMMARY ANSWER: We found no significant differences in reproductive outcomes of ICSI cycles within a wide range of times between OPU and ICSI. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In assisted reproduction, the oocyte is subject to denudation, vitrification/warming and ICSI. As shorter interaction with cumulus cells, oocyte ageing in vitro and insufficient recovery after warming may all impact the resulting embryo developmental competence, strictly controlled times between procedures are often implemented. However, most protocols have not been tested with the aim to improve reproductive results, and little information is available on the ideal times to be followed during these steps in order to optimize fertilization rates and embryo quality, and to achieve the highest pregnancy rate. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Data from 3986 ICSI cycles performed between December 2012 and May 2014 were included (3178 with fresh and 808 with vitrified/warmed donor oocytes). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: ICSI was performed using donor oocytes and either partner or donor sperm. Exact times between OPU, denudation, vitrification, warming and ICSI were recorded automatically by a radiofrequency-based system. OPU was performed strictly 36 h after GnRH agonist trigger. Biochemical pregnancy was defined as a positive serum betaHCG 15 days after transfer, clinical pregnancy was defined as a visible embryo with heartbeat 5 weeks after transfer, and ongoing pregnancy was defined as a normally developing pregnancy at 12 weeks after transfer. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Times between OPU and ICSI (OPU-ICSI) ranged from 1 h 25 min to 17 h 13 min (averagefresh +/- SD = 4 h 58 m +/- 1 h; averagevitrified= 9 h 18 m +/- 2 h). We found no effect of OPU-ICSI time on fertilization rate (pfresh=0.39; pvitrified=0.86) or embryo quality at Days 2 and 3 (pfresh=0.08; pvitrified=0.22). There was no difference in average OPU-ICSI times between positive and negative pregnancies (biochemical, clinical, ongoing and live birth rates) in either fresh (P = 0.71, 0.43, 0.79, 0.96) or vitrified (P = 0.59, 0.33, 0.73, 0.87) oocytes, respectively. Data were adjusted for oocyte donor age, semen status, number of motile spermatozoa and sperm concentration, and no effect of OPU-ICSI time on pregnancy and live birth rates for either fresh (P = 0.57, 0.16, 0.11, 0.46) or vitrified (P = 0.80, 0.73, 0.91, 0.95) oocytes was found. Further analysis for linear trend using OPU-ICSI time categorized in deciles showed that pregnancy rates and live birth rates do not increase or decrease across deciles. We found no effect of time taken for denudation to vitrification, warming to ICSI and denudation to ICSI on pregnancy rates. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This is a study with automatically collected times from a high number of ICSI cases; however, its retrospective nature cannot exclude the influence of unaccounted for variables on the results. All oocytes came from oocyte donors (</=35 years old), so results cannot be extended to older or infertile women. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results indicate that the effective window of time for insemination by ICSI might be wider than previously thought. It therefore appears that, within appropriate time frames, the management of ICSI cycles involving oocytes from young women in embryology laboratories could be adjusted to accommodate caseloads and workflow with no loss of oocyte viability or cycle efficiency."
"Background and Aim: There is a dearth of community data on nature, prevalence, clinical features, and explanatory models related to sexual dysfunction among men, particularly from rural India. This study attempted to examine different aspects of male sexual dysfunction and misconceptions in the community. Materials and Methods: Villages in Kaniyambadi Block, Vellore district were stratified, and four were randomly selected. Men living in these villages were recruited for the study. The following instruments were administered: (i) International Index of Erectile Function, (ii) Chinese Index of Premature Ejaculation (iii) Short Explanatory Model Interview, and (iv) Revised Clinical Interview Schedule. The data were analyzed using standard bivariate and multivariate statistics. Results: A total of 211 men were recruited. The majority were middle-aged (mean 40.73 years), literate (84.8%), married, and with children (72%), from nuclear families (99.6%), followed the Hindu religion (87.7%), reported satisfaction with their marriage (51.2%), had a single sexual partner (99.5%), and practised contraception (88.2%). A minority reported erectile dysfunction (29.9%), premature ejaculation (19.4%), and depression/anxiety (30.8%). Erectile dysfunction was associated with single marital status (P < 0.001), premature ejaculation (P < 0.001), worry about nocturnal emission and loss of semen (P < 0.02), and punishment by God as causal beliefs (P < 0.001). Premature ejaculation was associated with diabetes mellitus (P < 0.05), alcohol use (P < 0.05), anxiety and depression (P < 0.01), guilt about masturbation (P < 0.001), and belief that nocturnal emission is causal (P < 0.001) and erectile dysfunction (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Sexual misconception and dysfunction in men are significant problems in rural communities in India. They mandate the need for sex education in schools and the empowerment of physicians in primary and secondary care to manage such problems."
"Dieting is generally not effective in establishing weight loss and research has focused on documenting these negative consequences of dieting. Much less is known about why people diet. The present study employed a large and representative community sample to determine the demographic and psychological correlates of dieting and to examine the hypothesis that food concerns are associated with considering oneself a dieter. Participants from a community sample (n = 1113) completed an internet survey on dieting (restraint scale of the DEBQ) and its demographic and psychological correlates, with a specific focus on food concerns. In addition, they completed a 7-day snack diary to determine their food intake. According to sex-specific norm scores, 63.2% of the men and 62.7% of the women qualified as a dieter, defined as having elevated scores on the DEBQ restraint scale. Women and older people more often reported to diet, as did people with higher weights. In line with our hypothesis, food concerns (weight concerns and concerns about the diet-health link) were most strongly associated with dieting. Considering oneself as a dieter was weakly related to actual snack consumption whereas food concerns were unrelated to the consumption of snacks. Considering oneself as a dieter in terms of endorsing items on a restraint scale is an expression of food concerns that is virtually unaccompanied by changes in food intake. These findings suggest a reinterpretation of the dieting concept in terms of a strategy for coping with food concerns which need consideration in future research."
"PURPOSE: We tested whether providing a genetic risk score (GRS) for coronary artery disease (CAD) would serve as a motivator to improve adherence to risk-reducing strategies. METHODS: We randomized 94 participants with at least moderate risk of CAD to receive standard-of-care with (N = 49) or without (N = 45) their GRS at a subsequent 3-month follow-up visit. Our primary outcome was change in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) between the 3- and 6-month follow-up visits (DeltaLDL-C). Secondary outcomes included other CAD risk factors, weight loss, diet, physical activity, risk perceptions, and psychological outcomes. In pre-specified analyses, we examined whether there was a greater motivational effect in participants with a higher GRS. RESULTS: Sixty-five participants completed the protocol including 30 participants in the GRS arm. We found no change in the primary outcome between participants receiving their GRS and standard-of-care participants (DeltaLDL-C: -13 vs. -9 mg/dl). Among participants with a higher GRS, we observed modest effects on weight loss and physical activity. All other secondary outcomes were not significantly different, including anxiety and worry. CONCLUSION: Adding GRS to standard-of-care did not change lipids, adherence, or psychological outcomes. Potential modest benefits in weight loss and physical activity for participants with high GRS need to be validated in larger trials."
"BACKGROUND: Increased understanding of weight loss among healthy young people in naturalistic settings could inform the development of effective weight control programs. The aim of this study was to describe loss in BMI over 7 years in a population-based sample of healthy young adolescents (mean age 17 years at beginning of follow-up) and identify determinants of BMI loss. DESIGN AND METHOD: Data were available for 681 participants in the Nicotine Dependence in Teens Study (1999-2012), a longitudinal investigation of adolescents in Montreal (Canada). Loss in BMI was assessed between age 17 and 24 years. Potential predictors of BMI loss including age, sex, mother's education, worry about weight, physical activity, screen time, and cigarette smoking were studied in multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Males and females gained 2.0 and 1.4 BMI units, respectively, on average, between age 17 and 24 years. However, 9% of males and 14% of females experienced a loss in BMI >/=1.0 unit. Female sex and a higher BMI at age 17 were associated with a higher probability of BMI loss, but none of age, mother's education, physical activity, screen time, or cigarette smoking were associated with BMI loss between ages 17 and 24. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas BMI increased on average between age 17 and 24 years in a population-based sample of healthy young people, 12% of participants experienced a loss in BMI >/=1 unit. Weight loss was highest among the heaviest persons and did not affect the prevalence of underweight. No single behavior at age 17 stands out as associated with predicting BMI loss."
"Worry is the central characteristic of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and obsessions are a central feature of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). There are strong similarities between these disorders: repetitive cognitive intrusions, negative emotions, difficulty dismissing the intrusion and finally, loss of mental control. Direct comparisons between obsessions and worries are almost non-existent in the literature but key distinctions have been proposed. The study attempted to specify the differences between obsessive intrusive thoughts and worry in a nonclinical population across a series of variables drawn from current models (appraisal, general descriptors and emotional reactions). 254 students participated in the study. They first identified an obsession-like intrusion and a worry and then evaluated them with the Cognitive Intrusion Questionnaire. Within-subject comparisons demonstrated significant differences on several variables: frequency, duration, percentage of verbal and image content, interference, egodystonic nature, stimuli awareness, emotions, etc. Most of these differences remained significant after controlling for frequency of thought. Discriminant analysis demonstrated a low classification error rate when using nine variables to categorize thoughts as obsessions or worries. Results generally support the differences postulated in the literature with the exception that obsessive intrusive thoughts are better controlled. The egodystonic/egosyntonic dimension emerged as an important variable in understanding obsessions and worry."
"A woman aged 47 years reported the feeling of a lump in her throat for the past year. The sensation was present intermittently and usually improved when she ate. She noted it was worse with dry swallows when she felt like a tablet was stuck in her throat. The sensation had become more persistent in recent weeks leading her to worry that she had cancer. She had no cough, sore throat or hoarseness. There were no precipitating factors and no symptoms of weight loss, dysphagia, odynophagia or change in her voice. She had smoked previously and rarely had heartburn. She had no other anxieties and was not under any unusual stress. She was initially assessed by an ear, nose and throat surgeon, who found no abnormalities on examination of her neck, throat and oral cavity. Nasolaryngoscopy was normal. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was organised and reported a hiatus hernia, but a 3-month trial of a proton pump inhibitor did not have any impact on her symptoms. The benign nature of her symptoms was discussed at her gastroenterology follow-up appointment. She was discharged back to primary care with a final diagnosis of 'globus'. A trial of speech therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy or amitriptyline would be recommended if her symptoms became more troublesome in future."
"This paper presents ethical dilemmas concerning the termination of pregnancy, the management of childbirth, and the withdrawal of life-support from infants in special care, for a small sample of British Pakistani Muslim parents of babies diagnosed with fatal abnormalities. Case studies illustrating these dilemmas are taken from a qualitative study of 66 families of Pakistani origin referred to a genetics clinic in Southern England. The paper shows how parents negotiated between the authoritative knowledge of their doctors, religious experts, and senior family members in response to the ethical dilemmas they faced. There was little knowledge or open discussion of the view that Islam permits the termination of pregnancy for serious or fatal abnormality within 120 days and there was considerable disquiet over the idea of ending a pregnancy. For some parents, whether their newborn baby would draw breath was a main worry, with implications for the baby's Muslim identity and for the recognition of loss the parents would receive from family and community. This concern sometimes conflicted with doctors' concerns to minimize risk to future pregnancies by not performing a Caesarean delivery if a baby is sure to die. The paper also identifies parents' concerns and feelings of wrong-doing regarding the withdrawal of artificial life-support from infants with multiple abnormalities. The conclusion considers some of the implications of these observations for the counselling and support of Muslim parents following the pre- or neo-natal diagnosis of fatal abnormalities in their children."
"This paper reports on a systematic review undertaken in 2013 aimed at identifying evidence and dismissing some of the myths surrounding the needs of the veteran community. Papers were retrieved from a wide range of sources to ensure that literature covered the key areas of health concerns and focused also on time spent in service. Of the twenty eight papers reviewed categories relating to mental health (including PTSD and suicide), the use of alcohol, trauma, hearing loss, cancer and obesity were identified. Outcomes from the review established that while early service leavers were the most vulnerable there were also aspects within service that had an impact on future life events such as the type of leadership experienced, the cohesion of the unit and facing combat situations. The use of alcohol as a coping mechanism is also considered prevalent with adverse effects as is the worry of family situations at home. The impact of service life on the veteran, especially if suffering trauma will have long lasting psychological and physical outcomes, although it is recognised that veterans in the main have excellent physical and psychological strength and many physical illnesses are not greatly exaggerated from that of the general public."
"Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea is a diagnosis of exclusion that is common in female athletes, particularly those participating in aesthetic sports (ballet, other dance genres, figure skating, and gymnastics) and endurance sports (cross-country running). Although common, it should be considered abnormal even in the high-level elite athlete. Amenorrhea in combination with low energy availability and low bone density is labeled ""the Female Athlete Triad."" Studies have demonstrated numerous long-term consequences of athletes suffering from all or a portion of this triad, including increased rate of musculoskeletal injuries, stress fractures, abnormal lipid profiles, endothelial dysfunction, potential irreversible bone loss, depression, anxiety, low self- esteem, and increased mortality. This article provides the clinician with the tools to evaluate an athlete with secondary amenorrhea, reviews the recommended treatment options for affected athletes, and discusses when to return to the activity in an effort to facilitate ""healthy"" participation."
"BACKGROUND: The quality of life (QOL) of patients who survive early gastric cancer (EGC) is an area of increasing interest. OBJECTIVE: To compare the QOL and degree of worry of cancer recurrence in EGC patients who underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) or surgery. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTINGS: A tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: A total of 565 patients with EGC who received ESD or surgery. INTERVENTION: Questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: QOL was evaluated using the Short-form Health Survey and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QOL questionnaires (QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-STO22). Mood disorders and the worry of cancer recurrence were estimated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Worry of Cancer Scale, respectively. RESULTS: Questionnaires were completed by 55.7% of the ESD (137/246) and 58.9% of the surgery (188/319) patients. The surgery group had more QOL-related symptomatic and functional problems, including fatigue (P=.044), nausea/vomiting (P=.032), appetite loss (P=.023), diarrhea (P<.001), pain (P=.013), reflux symptoms (P=.005), eating restrictions (P<.001), anxiety (P=.015), taste impairment (P=.011), and poor body image (P<.001). The ESD group had significantly higher worry of cancer recurrence scores after adjusting for covariates, especially when visiting their physicians. The HADS results did not differ between the groups. LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional design. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic treatment for EGC provides a better QOL, but stomach preservation might provoke cancer recurrence worries. Endoscopists should address this issue for relieving a patient's concern of cancer recurrence during follow-up period after ESD. ( CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: WHO ICTRP KCT0000791.)."
"BACKGROUND: Delay in symptomatic presentation leading to advanced stage at diagnosis may contribute to poor cancer survival. To inform public health approaches to promoting early symptomatic presentation, we aimed to identify risk factors for delay in presentation across several cancers. METHODS: We surveyed 2371 patients with 15 cancers about nature and duration of symptoms using a postal questionnaire. We calculated relative risks for delay in presentation (time from symptom onset to first presentation >3 months) by cancer, symptoms leading to diagnosis and reasons for putting off going to the doctor, controlling for age, sex and deprivation group. RESULTS: Among 1999 cancer patients reporting symptoms, 21% delayed presentation for >3 months. Delay was associated with greater socioeconomic deprivation but not age or sex. Patients with prostate (44%) and rectal cancer (37%) were most likely to delay and patients with breast cancer least likely to delay (8%). Urinary difficulties, change of bowel habit, systemic symptoms (fatigue, weight loss and loss of appetite) and skin symptoms were all common and associated with delay. Overall, patients with bleeding symptoms were no more likely to delay presentation than patients who did not have bleeding symptoms. However, within the group of patients with bleeding symptoms, there were significant differences in risk of delay by source of bleeding: 35% of patients with rectal bleeding delayed presentation, but only 9% of patients with urinary bleeding. A lump was a common symptom but not associated with delay in presentation. Twenty-eight percent had not recognised their symptoms as serious and this was associated with a doubling in risk of delay. Embarrassment, worry about what the doctor might find, being too busy to go to the doctor and worry about wasting the doctor's time were also strong risk factors for delay, but were much less commonly reported (<6%). INTERPRETATION: Approaches to promote early presentation should aim to increase awareness of the significance of cancer symptoms and should be designed to work for people of the lowest socioeconomic status. In particular, awareness that rectal bleeding is a possible symptom of cancer should be raised."
"INTRODUCTION: A high percentage of the population initiate or keep diets to lose weight independently of suffering or not overweight/obesity. Nevertheless, exists a great unknowledge on the more convenient guidelines to achieve this aim. OBJECTIVE: To analyze weight perception and types of behavior to control the corporal weight in Spanish adults in order to be able to start the campaigns most adapted to provide a correct nutritional information to the population. METHODS: 2,168 subjects (18 +/- 50 years) of 5 Spanish provinces were studied. Anthropometric and information about the worry about corporal weight data was obtained. RESULTS: 65.6% of subjects declare a desire to lose weight and 44.9% have followed diets with this purpose in some moment (especially in female population). 63.9% of subjects increase physical activity to control weight, 23.9% consumes dietetic products or medicinal herbs and 48.0% compensate the excesses when they try to lose weight. Sweets (24.5%), fats (15.4%), pastries (11.4%) and bread (11.4%) are avoided and fruits and vegetables consumption is increased (specially by women) when try to lose weight. CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss practices use to be inadequate due to the desire to lose weight quickly and to the unknowledge about the most adecuate diet to achieve this aim. It is necessary to avoid this type of practices and to improve the knowledge on nutrition in the population."
"CONTEXT: Hypophosphatasia (HPP) features deficient activity of the ""tissue-nonspecific"" isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) due to loss-of-function mutation(s) within the TNSALP gene. Consequently, inorganic pyrophosphate, a TNSALP substrate and inhibitor of mineralization, accumulates extracellularly. This can cause rickets or osteomalacia. OBJECTIVE: We report a 55-year-old man with HPP and chronic renal failure (CRF) requiring hemodialysis who developed severe hypercalcemia acutely after traumatic fractures and immobilization. He manifested HPP in childhood and in middle age received hemodialysis for CRF attributed to hypertension and anti-inflammatory medication. He took 2 g of calcium carbonate orally each day to bind dietary phosphorus, but never aluminum hydroxide or any form of vitamin D. Pretrauma serum levels of calcium spanned 8.4-10.7 mg/dL (normal [Nl], 8.6-10.3), inorganic phosphate 5.8-6.4 mg/dL (Nl, 2.5-4.5), and PTH 63-75 pg/mL (Nl, 10-55). RESULTS: Rapid succession falls fractured multiple major bones. Six hours later, he became confused. Serum calcium was 14.9 mg/dL, ionized calcium was 7.4 mg/dL (Nl, 4.5-5.1), and PTH was 16 pg/mL. Hemodialysis quickly corrected his hypercalcemia and confusion. Low serum alkaline phosphatase persisted, and follow-up skeletal histopathology showed that his osteomalacia was severe. CONCLUSION: Hemodialysis does not heal the skeletal disease of HPP. During sudden fracture immobilization in HPP, sufficient calcium can emerge from bone, perhaps from a rapidly exchangeable calcium pool, to cause acute severe hypercalcemia if the kidneys cannot compensate for the mineral efflux. Hence, we worry that acute hypercalcemia might accompany sudden immobilization in CRF patients without HPP if they have adynamic bone disease."
"BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is frequent in older people and a precursor for morbidity and hospitalisation; furthermore low intake and weight loss during and after hospitalisation is well-described. Such patients are often excluded from technology projects on account of lack of skills. This is a barrier for their access to many current and future health care offers. OBJECTIVES: To test the acceptability, feasibility and preliminary efficacy of technology-supported energy- and protein-enforced homedelivered meals for older patients discharged from hospital. DESIGN: Mixed method design including a quasi-experimental controlled feasibility trial and embedded qualitative interviews. PARTICIPANTS: Older medical patients (mean age 79.4 years; women 66.7%) at nutritional risk and discharged to own home were included consecutively to first the control group (n=18) and later the intervention group (n=18). Nine intervention and 16 control group patients completed the project. METHODS: Intervention: group received: 1) enriched meals delivered to participants' homes 12 weeks after discharge, and 2) a tablet computer combining goal setting for intake with self-monitoring and feedback. Control group were treated as usual. Data collection was done at baseline, and at six and 12 weeks follow-up. Feasibility evaluation focused on 1) inclusion and retention and 2) acceptability and functionality of the intervention. Efficacy primary endpoint: Muscle strength and BMI. Secondary: Health related quality of life (HRQoL), depression; readmissions, mortality. RESULTS: Technology challenges were related to immaturity of the out-of hospital app version; however, participants were motivated and capable of using the device. Inclusion and retention was challenged by the acceptability of the nutritional intervention and exhaustion among patients. Mortality was high. Although weaker at baseline the intervention group increased their muscle strength more consistently than did the control group: Handgrip strength with 2.5kg vs 0.9kg and chairto-stand-test with 3.3 vs. 1.8 times. They also improved their depression score and HRQoL more, and patients reported increased intake, appetite, and energy in the interviews. Relatives confirmed this and also reported positive impact on their level of worry and on the relationship with the older person. CONCLUSION: The study provided valuable insight into appropriate methods and procedures as well as older people's preferences and views on barriers to successful intervention and use of technology in health care. This will guide the design of a future sufficiently powered study. Effect evaluation provided guidance for future sample size calculation."
"Hirsutism is a common medical complaint among women of reproductive age, and it affects the majority of women with the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Increased rate of androgen production and its availability in tissue represent the main pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for hirsutism. In addition, androgens may be generated de novo in the hair follicle; therefore, circulating androgen levels do not quantify the real exposure of the hair follicle to androgens, as a quota is locally generated. Hirsutism is a clinical sign and not a disease in itself; its presence does not therefore necessarily require treatment, particularly in mild-to-moderate forms, and when an affected woman does not worry about it. Physicians should decide whether hirsutism is to be treated or not by evaluating not only the severity of the phenomenon but also the subjective perception of the patient, which does not necessarily correspond to the true extent of hair growth. In any case, a physician should manage a woman with hirsutism only on the basis of a diagnosis of the underlying cause, and after a clear explanation of the efficacy of each therapeutic choice. Cosmetic procedures and pharmacological intervention are commonly used in the treatment of hirsutism and are discussed in this paper. Importantly, there are different phenotypes of women with hirsutism and PCOS that may require specific attention in the choice of treatment. In particular, when obesity is present, lifestyle intervention should be always considered, and if necessary combined with pharmacotherapy."
"OBJECTIVES: To promote a broader understanding of the psychosocial impact of childhood cancer on siblings, a systematic review was undertaken. Directions for future research are proposed and clinical strategies are suggested for addressing the needs of these children. METHODS: Searches of Medline, PsycINFO and CINAHL revealed 65 relevant qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods' papers published between 1997 and 2008. These papers were rated for scientific merit and findings were extracted for summary. RESULTS: Siblings of children with cancer do not experience elevated mean rates of psychiatric disorders, but a significant subset experiences post-traumatic stress symptoms, negative emotional reactions (e.g. shock, fear, worry, sadness, helplessness, anger, and guilt), and poor quality of life in emotional, family, and social domains. In general, distress is greater closer to time of diagnosis. School difficulties are also evident within 2 years of diagnosis. Qualitative studies reveal family-level themes such as loss of attention and status as well as positive outcomes including increased sibling maturity and empathy. CONCLUSIONS: Research regarding siblings of children with cancer continues to be methodologically limited. The conclusions of qualitative and quantitative studies differ considerably. We propose a research agenda to propel this field forward including greater attention to alterations in normative development (as opposed to psychiatric conditions), development of more appropriate quantitative measures, examination of potential moderators of adaptation, and use of prospective longitudinal designs. Siblings of children with cancer are a psychosocially at-risk group and should be provided with appropriate supportive services."
"INTRODUCTION: Falls are common in older people and increase in prevalence with advancing old age. There is limited knowledge about their impact in those aged 85 years and older, the fastest growing age group of the population. We investigated the prevalence and impact of falls, and the overlap between falls, dizziness and blackouts, in a population-based sample of 85 year olds. METHODS: DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from Newcastle 85+ Cohort Study. SETTING: Primary care, North-East England. PARTICIPANTS: 816 men and women aged 85 years. MEASUREMENTS: Structured interview with research nurse. Cost-consequence analysis of fall-related healthcare costs. RESULTS: Over 38% (313/816) of participants had fallen at least once in the previous 12 months and of these: 10.6% (33/312) sustained a fracture, 30.1% (94/312) attended an emergency department, and 12.8% (40/312) were admitted to hospital. Only 37.2% (115/309) of fallers had specifically discussed their falls problem with their general practitioner and only 12.7% (39/308) had seen a falls specialist. The average annual healthcare cost per faller was estimated at pound202 (inter-quartile range pound174- pound231) or US$329 ($284-$377). 'Worry about falling' was experienced by 42.0% (128/305) of fallers, 'loss of confidence' by 40.0% (122/305), and 'going out less often' by 25.9% (79/305); each was significantly more common in women, odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for women: men of 2.63 (1.45-4.55), 4.00 (2.27-7.14), and 2.86 (1.54-5.56) respectively. Dizziness and blackouts were reported by 40.0% (318/796) and 6.4% (52/808) of participants respectively. There was marked overlap in the report of falls, dizziness and blackouts. CONCLUSIONS: Falls in 85 year olds are very common, associated with considerable psychological and physical morbidity, and have high impact on healthcare services. Wider use of fall prevention services is needed. Significant expansion in acute and preventative services is required in view of the rapid growth in this age group."
"Complicated grief is a recently recognized condition that occurs in about 7% of bereaved people. People with this condition are caught up in rumination about the circumstances of the death, worry about its consequences, or excessive avoidance of reminders of the loss. Unable to comprehend the finality and consequences of the loss, they resort to excessive avoidance of reminders of the loss as they are tossed helplessly on waves of intense emotion. People with complicated grief need help, and clinicians need to know how to recognize the symptoms and how to provide help. This paper provides a framework to help clinicans understand bereavement, grief, and mourning. Evidence-based diagnostic criteria are provided to help clinicians recognize complicated grief, and differentiate it from depression as well as anxiety disorder. We provide an overview of risk factors and basic assumptions and principles that can guide treatment."
"AIM: to elucidate the effects of prior mental disorders on newly delivered women's mental health and to compare the outcome of different instruments to screen for maternal distress and depression after childbirth. The sample of 232 Stockholm women responded to a questionnaire on background data and three questionnaires, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Postpartum Depression Symptoms Rating Scale (PPDS) at 4-6 weeks and 10-12 weeks after childbirth. RESULTS: show that maternal distress was experienced by 20% of the women as assessed by the BDI and the EPDS at 4-6 weeks postpartum, and by 13-16% of the women at 10-12 weeks after childbirth. A regression analysis showed that a history of mental health problems influenced maternal self-assessment at both points-in-time. The following background data showed a small but significant impact on maternal self-assessment; younger age, lower educational level, and a short-term partner relationship. The most important emotional responses were sadness, guilt and self-blame across all three instruments at both points in time. Loss of pleasure, self-accusations, irritability, anger, worry and somatic symptoms such as muscular tension, headaches and stomach cramps also occurred. CONCLUSION: women with prior mental health problems are more vulnerable for maternal distress and midwives at the antenatal health clinics should encourage pregnant women to express emotional issues during their transition to motherhood in order to offer appropriate professional support and care."
"""Distress disorders,"" which include generalized anxiety disorder and major depression are often highly comorbid with each other and appear to be characterized by common temperamental features that reflect heightened sensitivity to underlying motivational systems related to threat/safety and reward/loss. Further, individuals with distress disorders tend to utilize self-referential processes (e.g., worry, rumination, self-criticism) in a maladaptive attempt to respond to motivationally relevant distress, often resulting in suboptimal contextual learning. Despite the success of cognitive behavioral therapies for emotional disorders, a sizable subgroup of patients with distress disorders fail to evidence adequate treatment response. Emotion Regulation Therapy (ERT) is a theoretically derived, evidence based, treatment that integrates principles (e.g., skills training, exposure) from traditional and contemporary therapies with findings from basic and translational affective science to offer a framework for improving intervention by focusing on the motivational responses and corresponding regulatory characteristics of individuals with high levels of chronic distress. Open and randomized controlled trials have demonstrated preliminary support for the utility of ERT as reflected by strong effect sizes comparable to and exceeding established intervention approaches. In addition, pilot findings support the role of underlying proposed mechanisms in this efficacious response. This article presents the functional model associated with ERT and describes the proposed mechanisms of the treatment. Additionally, a clinical case is presented, allowing the reader to gain a greater applied understanding of the different components of the ERT model and treatment."
"Patients who receive ambulatory-based chemotherapy worry about nausea and vomiting leading to appetite loss, decreased activity, and finally, the lowering of QOL. The management of nausea and vomiting also prevents decreased body weight loss, encourages compliance with chemotherapy treatments, and promotes social activity. Recently, NCCN, ASCO, MASCC as well as JSCO guideline for antiemesis were updated and approved for delayed antiemetic drugs in Japan. According to these guidelines, we should administer antiemetic drugs appropriately to prevent anticipatory emesis. Last year, in a retrospective analysis of head and neck cancer, in a comparison of before and after the use of aprepitant, the use can improved the dose intensity of CDDP and one-year survival after chemotherapy. We need to have prospective analyses, but appropriate use of antiemetic drugs and management of chemotherapy lead to a better clinical outcome and safety."
"BACKGROUND: In the recent literature on cancer survivorship, positive changes are emphasized in the aftermath of trauma. However, there is insufficient research on older-adult survivors and more complex transformations. OBJECTIVE: Consistent with nursing researchers' views about the duality of cancer survivor experiences, this research examined both positive and negative posttraumatic transformations (PTTs) among long-term survivors. Demographic, stress, and appraisal-related predictors of transformations were considered. METHODS: Using cross-sectional survey design, interviews were conducted with 288 survivors of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer. The sample, obtained from a hospital tumor registry, was 58% female, 33% African American, and 67% white (mean age, 72.5 [SD, 7.6] years). Demographic characteristics, cumulative stress exposure, appraisals of stress, and self-reported PTTs were measured. RESULTS: Most respondents reported diverse transformations attributed to their illness experience. Demographic characteristics and stress appraisals were more strongly associated with PTT outcomes than was cumulative stress exposure. Appraisals of the cancer experience as stressful, as generating worry, and as stigmatizing were significantly associated with diverse PTT outcomes. CONCLUSION: Many long-term older cancer survivors report PTT reflecting altered perspectives on life. Posttraumatic transformations are related to the view that cancer is a continuing worrisome and stigmatizing experience. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurses have a unique opportunity to discuss with patients the potentially life-changing nature of the cancer experience in a manner that allows for understanding and acceptance of complex changes, incorporating benefit finding along with acknowledgement of loss and suffering. This type of discussion can enhance cancer survivors' mental health."
"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to examine whether a widely available single-item measure of sleep disturbances is an acceptable alternative to a multi-item sleep questionnaire. METHODS: Data were derived from Finnish Helsinki Health Study postal questionnaires administered in 2000-2002 (n = 7777, response rate 67%). The measures were the 4-item Jenkins Sleep Questionnaire (JSQ) on difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep, and nonrestorative sleep, and an item on sleep loss due to worry, from the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analyses were done to compare the predictive performance of the GHQ-12 item with the JSQ scale. Using the above 2 measures of sleep, logistic regression models were used to examine associations between sociodemographic factors, working conditions, health-related factors, and sleep disturbance. RESULTS: The estimated area under the ROC curve was 0.68 among both women and men, which suggests that the ability of the GHQ-12 item to discriminate true positives from false positives was modest. However, the associations of sleep disturbance with its key determinants were largely similar using the GHQ-12 and the JSQ. CONCLUSIONS: A widely available, GHQ-12-based, single-item sleep measure was not an adequate substitute for a multi-item measure of overall sleep disturbance. Although the measures produced largely similar associations for key determinants of poor sleep, the discrepancies between responses must be considered when analyzing data from a measure that uses a single sleep item."
"BACKGROUND: Minority children have the highest US uninsurance rates; Latino and African-American children account for 53 % of uninsured American children, despite comprising only 48 % of the total US child population. The study aim was to examine parental awareness of and the reasons for lacking health insurance in Medicaid/CHIP-eligible minority children, and the impact of the children's uninsurance on health, access to care, unmet needs, and family financial burden. METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, a consecutive series of uninsured, Medicaid/CHIP-eligible Latino and African-American children was recruited at 97 urban Texas community sites, including supermarkets, health fairs, and schools. Measures/outcomes were assessed using validated instruments, and included sociodemographic characteristics, uninsurance duration, reasons for the child being uninsured, health status, special healthcare needs, access to medical and dental care, unmet needs, use of health services, quality of care, satisfaction with care, out-of-pocket costs of care, and financial burden. RESULTS: The mean time uninsured for the 267 participants was 14 months; 5 % had never been insured. The most common reason for insurance loss was expired and never reapplied (30 %), and for never being insured, high insurance costs. Only 49 % of parents were aware that their uninsured child was Medicaid/CHIP eligible. Thirty-eight percent of children had suboptimal health, and 2/3 had special healthcare needs, but 64 % have no primary-care provider; 83 % of parents worry about their child's health more than others. Unmet healthcare needs include: healthcare, 73 %; mental healthcare, 70 %; mobility aids/devices, 67 %; dental, 61 %; specialty care, 57 %; and vision, 46 %. Due to the child's health, 35 % of parents had financial problems, 23 % cut work hours, and 10 % ceased work. Higher proportions of Latinos lack primary-care providers, and higher proportions of African-Americans experience family financial burden. CONCLUSIONS: Half of parents of uninsured minority children are unaware that their children are Medicaid/CHIP-eligible. These uninsured children have suboptimal health, impaired access to care, and major unmet needs. The child's health causes considerable family financial burden, and one in 10 parents ceased work. The study findings indicate urgent needs for better parental education about Medicaid/CHIP, and for improved Medicaid/CHIP outreach and enrollment."
"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Individuals living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) often face progressive loss of function, uncertainty and disruption to self-image and valued roles. Previous studies show that creative self-expression is valued by some people living with long-term illness, yet its meaning for people living with MS is unclear. This research study explored the meanings of leisure-based visual art-making for people living with MS. METHOD: This qualitative study followed guidelines for Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Single semi-structured interviews were conducted with five adults (2 males; 3 females; 40-65 years), recruited from MS Ireland. FINDINGS: Participants valued art-making for contributing to a more satisfying way of life; for filling occupational voids and using time well. Deep immersion offered respite from worry about illness. Creative classes offered social camaraderie and opportunities for learning and development. Art-making processes and products were highly affirmative, increasing emotional well-being and promoting self-worth. Most felt that they expressed valued aspects of self through their art. Art-making appeared to assist with identity maintenance, accommodating functional losses associated with MS whilst opening ""new doors"". CONCLUSION: Art-making offered a multi-faceted means of supporting identity and increasing fulfilment in lives that were restricted in many ways by MS."
"OBJECTIVES: This study examines the relationship between a predisposition to hallucinations and meta-cognitive variables and thought-control techniques, controlling for the possible effect of anxiety. In order to do so, we start out with the hypothesis that anxiety does not, in itself, explain the association between meta-cognitions and a predisposition to auditory and visual hallucinations. DESIGN: A within-participants correlational design was employed. METHODS: Four psychometric tests relating to predisposition to hallucinations, anxiety, meta-cognitions and thought-control techniques were administered to 150 participants. RESULTS: It was found that, after controlling for participants' anxiety levels, the 'loss of cognitive confidence' factor predicted the score on the scale of predisposition to both auditory and visual hallucinations. Thought-control strategies based on worry were also found to be predictive of a greater predisposition to hallucinations, regardless of whether or not participants' anxiety level was controlled. CONCLUSIONS: Meta-cognitive variables of cognitive confidence and thought control through worry are positively associated with a predisposition to hallucinations. LIMITATIONS: The correlational nature of the design does not allow inferences about causal relationships."
"This paper advances conceptualization of maternal distress following incarceration. We utilized a multiple case study methodology based on interviews with 10 mothers who demonstrated various permutations of ""the triple threat"" (depression, domestic violence, and substance abuse; Arditti & Few, 2006). Findings suggest that depressive symptomology persisted and worsened for mothers in our study and that maternal distress was indicative not only of women's psychological state, but also a relational and situational construct that embodied women's core experience. Maternal distress was largely characterized by health challenges, dysfunctional intimate relationships, loss related trauma, guilt and worry over children, and economic inadequacy. Further, maternal distress seemed to be intensified by the punitive traumatic context of prison and lessened by rehabilitation opportunities as well as support by kin and probation officers after reentry. Recommendations for clinicians and professionals who work with reentry mothers center around the need to alleviate maternal distress and better address women's emotional and physical health needs during incarceration and reentry."
"BACKGROUND: Childhood cancers evoke various emotional reactions in caregivers which can impair their well-being and roles. Little is known about caregiving and which cancer-associated factors are related to caregiver's depression in resource-restricted settings. We sought to investigate if child's symptom burden is related to depressive symptoms in caregivers. METHODS: Seventy-two caregivers and children with cancers were administered questionnaires to elicit socio-demographic and disease-related data. Subsequently, the child's symptoms were profiled with Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS 7-12); while screening for depressive symptoms in caregivers was done using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised (CES-DR). RESULTS: All the caregivers were parents, and largely mothers (83.7%). The mean ages of caregivers and children were 39+/-2 and 10+/-2 years respectively. Majority of caregivers (90.3%) were either ignorant or attributed spiritual causation to the cancers. The common symptoms with prevalence >50% in the children included pain, nausea, worry, and lack of energy (LE); symptoms' prevalence ranged from LE (68%) to itching (32%). Approximately, one-third each of the children reported hair and weight loss which were considered 'unusual' in the design of MSAS 7-12. The symptoms showed variability in distress, frequency and intensity. In particular, pain, lack of appetite (LA) and feeling sad (FS) were reported as most burdensome in >50% of the children. More than one-third of caregivers (38.2%) screened positive for significant depressive symptoms. The global symptom burden (r=0.58) and individual symptom correlated positively with depressive symptoms in caregivers (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the need for improved awareness creation on childhood cancers to obviate late presentations and poor access to care. Again, early integration of pediatric palliative care in childhood cancer care to ensure symptom management as well as its extended benefits on caregivers' wellbeing is desirable. The pattern of certain ""unusual"" symptoms in children with cancer in our work suggests the need to put into consideration 'novel' symptoms which were not captured in existing instruments. Future research on supportive care in pediatric cancers is indicated."
"This article reports the qualitative arm of a mixed-methods study designed to test an in-home nighttime monitoring system (NMS) that tracks the nighttime activity of persons with dementia. Fourteen caregiver interviews were analyzed using grounded theory/full conceptual description methods to determine the issues associated with providing care at night and to explore the benefits of using the NMS. Caregivers not using the NMS experienced sleep disruption, overwhelming worry, and loss of personal space, leading to decreased energy and changes in mood. When the NMS was used, caregivers reported improved ""peace of mind."" The fear and uncertainty associated with worry was alleviated by reliable alerts regarding the whereabouts of the person with dementia. Some caregivers were able to better balance needs for personal space with needs to remain in contact with the person with dementia. Generally, caregivers reported improved quality of sleep, although some caregivers reported more awakenings due to the system alerts."
"RECORD LOW CONFIDENCE LEVELS: Workers who say they are very confident about having enough money for a comfortable retirement this year hit the lowest level in 2009 (13 percent) since the Retirement Confidence Survey started asking the question in 1993, continuing a two-year decline. Retirees also posted a new low in confidence about having a financially secure retirement, with only 20 percent now saying they are very confident (down from 41 percent in 2007). THE ECONOMY, INFLATION, COST OF LIVING ARE THE BIG CONCERNS: Not surprisingly, workers overall who have lost confidence over the past year about affording a comfortable retirement most often cite the recent economic uncertainty, inflation, and the cost of living as primary factors. In addition, certain negative experiences, such as job loss or a pay cut, loss of retirement savings, or an increase in debt, almost always contribute to loss of confidence among those who experience them. RETIREMENT EXPECTATIONS DELAYED: Workers apparently expect to work longer because of the economic downturn: 28 percent of workers in the 2009 RCS say the age at which they expect to retire has changed in the past year. Of those, the vast majority (89 percent) say that they have postponed retirement with the intention of increasing their financial security. Nevertheless, the median (mid-point) worker expects to retire at age 65, with 21 percent planning to push on into their 70s. The median retiree actually retired at age 62, and 47 percent of retirees say they retired sooner than planned. WORKING IN RETIREMENT: More workers are also planning to supplement their income in retirement by working for pay. The percentage of workers planning to work after they retire has increased to 72 percent in 2009 (up from 66 percent in 2007). This compares with 34 percent of retirees who report they actually worked for pay at some time during their retirement. GREATER WORRY ABOUT BASIC AND HEALTH EXPENSES: Workers who say they very confident in having enough money to take care of basic expenses in retirement dropped to 25 percent in 2009 (down from 40 percent in 2007), while only 13 percent feel very confident about having enough to pay for medical expenses (down from 20 percent in 2007. Among retirees, only a quarter (25 percent, down from 41 percent in 2007) feel very confident about covering their health expenses. HOW WORKERS ARE RESPONDING: Among workers who have lost confidence in their ability to secure a comfortable retirement, most (81 percent) say they have reduced their expenses, while others are changing the way they invest their money (43 percent), working more hours or a second job (38 percent), saving more money (25 percent), and seeking advice from a financial professional (25 percent). Among all workers, 75 percent say they and/or their spouse have saved money for retirement, one of the highest levels ever measured by the RCS. IGNORANCE STILL A MAJOR FACTOR: Many workers still do not have a good idea of how much they need to save for retirement. Only 44 percent of workers report they and/or their spouse have tried to calculate how much money they will need to have saved by the time they retire--and an equal proportion (44 percent) simply guess at how much they will need for a comfortable retirement."
"OBJECTIVES: To describe the impact upon maternal anxiety of newborn hearing screening and examine the Possible moderating role of knowledge. METHODS: Questionnaires assessing maternal state anxiety, worry and certainty about the baby's hearing, and knowledge about screening, were sent to four groups of mothers three weeks after screening: Group 1 consisted of mothers whose babies had clear responses on a first or second screening test (n=103); Group 2 consisted of mothers whose babies had clear responses on the third screening test (n=81); Group 3 consisted of mothers whose babies did not have clear responses in one ear at the third screening test and were referred for audiological assessment (n=105); and Group 4 consisted of mothers whose babies did not have clear responses in either ear at the third hearing test and were referred for audiological assessment (n=55). RESULTS: Although mean anxiety levels were in the normal range, there was a significant trend for anxiety to rise as testing increased (F(1,327)=4.280, P<0.05). Worry increased significantly (F(1,337)=70.432, P<0.001) and certainty decreased significantly (F(1,339)=27.474, P=0.001) as the number of tests increased. Although total knowledge did not significantly moderate anxiety (R(2)=0.016, P=0.096), there was a significant interaction between mothers' group and one knowledge item, understanding that receipt of no clear responses was unlikely to mean that the baby had a hearing loss: mothers in Group 4 who understood this had lower anxiety (F(3,323)=4.791, P<0.01) and lower worry (F(3,332)=3.565, P<0.01) compared with mothers who did not. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the meaning of being recalled following screening may avoid some of the anxiety associated with this."
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjunctive zonisamide (ZNS) therapy in Korean adults with uncontrolled partial epilepsy. METHODS: Study patients had an average of at least one seizure per 4-week (averaged over a 12-week historical baseline) despite the use of one to three antiepileptic drugs. The starting dose of ZNS was 100mg/day, and was increased to 200mg/day after 2weeks. During the 12-week maintenance period, the dose of ZNS was adjusted to 200-400mg/day based on the physicians' discretion. The global evaluation scale (GES) and quality of life (QOLIE-31) were also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 121 patients were enrolled, of which 88 patients completed the study. The median percent reduction in weekly seizure frequency over the treatment period was 59.0%. The >/=50% and >/=75% responder rates were 57.3% and 38.5%, respectively. Seizure freedom over the treatment period was observed in 25 patients, but seizure freedom throughout the 16-week treatment period was attained in only 16 patients. On investigator's GES, 84 patients were considered improved, with 33 patients showing marked improvement. In QOLIE-31 scale, seizure worry improved significantly but emotional well-being deteriorated. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were reported in 80 patients. The most common AEs were dizziness (28.1%), somnolence (24.0%), anorexia (18.2%), headache (14.0%), nausea (13.2%), and weight loss (10.7%). Twenty-two patients discontinued the trial due to drug-related AEs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that adjunctive ZNS therapy for the treatment of refractory partial epilepsy, though efficacious, is associated with significant tolerability problems."
"BACKGROUND: Offering patients online access to medical records, including doctors' visit notes, holds considerable potential to improve care. However, patients may worry about loss of privacy when accessing personal health information through Internet-based patient portals. The OpenNotes study provided patients at three US health care institutions with online access to their primary care doctors' notes and then collected survey data about their experiences, including their concerns about privacy before and after participation in the intervention. OBJECTIVE: To identify patients' attitudes toward privacy when given electronic access to their medical records, including visit notes. METHODS: The design used a nested cohort study of patients surveyed at baseline and after a 1-year period during which they were invited to read their visit notes through secure patient portals. Participants consisted of 3874 primary care patients from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA), Geisinger Health System (Danville, PA), and Harborview Medical Center (Seattle, WA) who completed surveys before and after the OpenNotes intervention. The measures were patient-reported levels of concern regarding privacy associated with online access to visit notes. RESULTS: 32.91% of patients (1275/3874 respondents) reported concerns about privacy at baseline versus 36.63% (1419/3874 respondents) post-intervention. Baseline concerns were associated with non-white race/ethnicity and lower confidence in communicating with doctors, but were not associated with choosing to read notes or desire for continued online access post-intervention (nearly all patients with notes available chose to read them and wanted continued access). While the level of concern among most participants did not change during the intervention, 15.54% (602/3874 respondents, excluding participants who responded ""don't know"") reported more concern post-intervention, and 12.73% (493/3874 respondents, excluding participants who responded ""don't know"") reported less concern. CONCLUSIONS: When considering online access to visit notes, approximately one-third of patients had concerns about privacy at baseline and post-intervention. These perceptions did not deter participants from accessing their notes, suggesting that the benefits of online access to medical records may outweigh patients' perceived risks to privacy."
"BACKGROUND: People living with cancer experience wide variety of symptoms. If symptoms are not managed well, it may hamper an individual's ability to continue his or her activities of daily life. Treatment of symptoms relieves suffering and improves the rate of recovery as well as the quality of life. OBJECTIVES: To assess the symptoms of suffering among cancer patients and to identify the perceived barriers to their symptom management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out among 768 cancer patients selected by stratified sampling with a proportionate selection from each stratum. Data were collected from cancer patients by interview technique using structured validated questionnaire. RESULTS: Majority of the samples (30.2%) belonged to the age group of 51-60 years, most of them were diagnosed with head and neck cancer (40.1%) and 57.7% had stage III disease. The majority of the patients studied had pain (77%), tiredness (96.5%), disturbed sleep (96.4%), weight loss (63.3%), and irritability (85.7%). Most of the patients had lack of appetite (89.4%), feeling of sadness (96.6%), worry (94.5%), and feeling of nervousness (82.8%). Majority of the patients had some misconception regarding symptoms, that is, increasing pain signifies disease progression (92.7%), medicine to control pain may weaken the immune system (89.9%) and pain is inevitable for cancer patients (78.5%). Seventy-seven percent of samples reported that the anxiety or depression is expected after the diagnosis of cancer. CONCLUSION: This study provides an overview of symptoms among cancer patients and barriers experienced by them."
"Newborns are routinely screened for hearing loss; screening typically occurs in the newborn nursery and newborn intensive care unit. Understanding the process and outcomes of initial hearing screening and ongoing early hearing detection and intervention programs (EHDI) are important roles of the newborn/neonatal intensive care (NICU) nurse. Infants that require NICU care are at higher risk of hearing loss and need close follow-up and repeat hearing testing throughout their first 3 years of life. Parents experience anxiety and worry related to potential hearing loss problems and need guidance, education, and information on infant hearing to ensure the best possible outcome for their infant."
"We assessed the quality of life (QOL) at least one year after sequential chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of localized gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We used the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire for Stomach Cancer (EORTC QLQ-STO22). Among the 45 patients available at the one-year follow-up after radiation therapy, 40 patients completed the EORTC QLQ-STO22 questionnaire. Their median age was 54.5 (range, 20-70 years). Social functioning was most adversely affected among the respondents with a score of 59, whereas other functions and the global scales were preserved above a score of 70 by linearly transformed values. Fatigue, the financial impact and specific emotional problems such as ""thinking about their illness"" (STO-ANX) and ""worry about weight loss or future health"" (STO-BI) were persistently bothersome for some patients. Other stomach-related symptoms such as dysphagia, pain, or reflux were negligible at 1 year after treatment. Therefore, this organ-preserving combined approach was effective for the maintenance of the QOL and minimization of stomach abnormalities in patients with gastric lymphoma."
"BACKGROUND: The majority of persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience onset of MS between the ages of 20 and 40. Since two-thirds of the persons with MS are young women of childbearing age, parenthood is an essential issue during this period of life. The potential influence of parental MS on children arises from the varied symptoms of the chronic illness, which affect physical and cognitive abilities. MS disabilities and fatigue can restrict daily life and result in less energy for activities or job loss and thus worse conditions for the family. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: This PhD thesis was designed to investigate whether parental MS influences children in different areas throughout the children's life course (i.e. education, employment, disability pension, and income) as well as to explore the experiences of having a parent with MS. We investigated the research question using two distinct METHODS: A quantitative method based on nationwide population-based Danish registers comparing a group of children with one biological parent with MS (termed 'MS offspring') with a matched group of children of parents without MS (termed 'reference cohort') up to 58 years of age (Papers I-II). A qualitative method based on phenomenological face-to-face interviews with young adults with parental MS (Paper III). The nationwide register-based epidemiological method complemented by a phenomenological interview method, the long time-span and the age groups of 'children' up to age 58 are original within this area of research. RESULTS: In Paper I, we investigated the educational achievements of 4,177 MS offspring compared with 33,416 reference children. MS off-spring achieved a higher grade point average in the final class of basic school, at age 15, although they achieved similar educational levels as did the reference children at ages 15 to 58. There was a trend toward more MS offspring women attaining health-related educations than did reference women at ages 21 to 58. In Paper II, we investigated employment and income of 2,456 MS offspring compared with 19,648 reference children. At age 30, the MS offspring were less often employed, and at ages 30 and 40 MS offspring more often received disability pension than did reference children. The mean income at the age interval of 45 to 49 years was similar. Analyzing whether the MS offspring earned more than DKK 250,000 annually (~ EUR 33,650), which is approximately double the level defined as poverty in Denmark in 2012, they earned above this level in annual gross personal in-come less frequently than did reference children. This income level was only sufficient for the bare necessities. In Paper III, we explored the experiences of children growing up with a parent with MS by interviewing 14 young adults between 18 and 25 years. The results in the interview study showed two essential themes: 'Caring' and 'Restraint'. Each essential theme emerged from four subthemes. Caring: Assuming responsibility; worry and guilt; choosing health-related educations; advantage of being responsible. Restraint: Concealing feelings and desires; anxiety and depression; shame; lack of openness and knowledge. All the young adults had experiences of the essential themes of caring and restraint. Half of the participants in the interview study were enrolled in a health-related education. CONCLUSION: Growing up with a parent with MS can have both beneficial and adverse influences on children late into adulthood. On the one hand, the educational achievements of MS offspring are either better or similar to those of reference children because they attained better grades and similar educational levels. Also, some of the young adults interviewed found advantages to having learned to be responsible. On the other hand, we found an ad-verse association regarding employment, disability pension, and income. Also, the young adults interviewed had experiences of caring for and of practicing restraint toward the parent with MS, the other parent, and siblings, with most participants continuing this pattern toward friends and partners. The results of caring and restraint might partly explain some of the associations found in the register-based studies. The children might continue taking care of their parents and striving to find a balance between helping others and fulfilling their own desires. This caregiver challenge might also partly explain the beneficial association between parental MS on education and the adverse association on employment. Thus, having a parent with MS might be associated with long-term socioeconomic influence on education, employment, disability pension, income, and social relations in children's life course: Parental MS influences children far into adulthood."
"OBJECTIVES: To show that hearing loss has such a high prevalence in the older population to justify screening, if effective and acceptable methods are available; and that population take-up and benefit can make a measurable outcome difference in quality of life. DESIGN: A population study of people aged 55-74 years was undertaken. A clinical effectiveness study of differently organised screening programmes was carried out using a controlled trial to identify those who might benefit from intervention (and the extent of the benefit). A retrospective case-control study examined the very long-term (more than 10 years) compliance of patients in using their hearing aids after early identification and determined the extent to which early-identified hearing-impaired people have better outcomes than equivalent people identified later. An examination of the costs and cost-effectiveness of different potential screening programmes was also undertaken. SETTING: A population study was designed in the UK, with specific stages being conducted in more depth on a sample of people from Nottingham and Southampton. The clinical effectiveness study was conducted in general practices in Nottingham and Bath using a systematic or opportunistic screen. The retrospective case-control study compared a group of early-identified hearing aid users, with control matched for age, gender and occupation, in Cardiff, Glasgow and Manchester. PARTICIPANTS: In Great Britain responses were obtained for 34,362 individuals from the postal questionnaire as part of a population study, 506 were interviewed, 351 were assessed for benefit from amplification and 87 were fitted with a hearing aid. The clinical effectiveness study received 1461 replies from the first-stage questionnaire screen, with 306 people assessed in the clinic, of whom 156 were fitted with hearing aids. The retrospective case-control study traced 116 previously fitted hearing aid users, who had been identified by a screen, and then conducted a case-control using 50 of these for whom complete data were available, matching with two control groups of 50 people. INTERVENTIONS: The major prospective interventions were to introduce amplification through offering people, with minimal hearing impairment, hearing aid(s) in a rehabilitative setting. In the population study, aids were offered as a monaural in-the-ear (ITE) hearing aid and in the clinical effectiveness study people who met the criteria were randomised to be offered two different ITE hearing aids to be fitted bilaterally. The retrospective case-control study used unilateral and bilateral hearing aids. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of hearing problems and degree to which services meet need in 55-74-year age group. Public acceptability and individual benefits of hearing screening and intervention as a function of demographic and hearing domain-specific characteristics. Improvement in quality of life. Screening costs and cost-effectiveness as a function of proposed programmes. RESULTS: It was found that 12% of people aged 55-74 years have a hearing problem that causes moderate or severe worry, annoyance or upset, 14% have a bilateral hearing impairment of at least 35 dB hearing level (HL) and only 3% currently receive intervention, through the use of hearing aids. Good amplification was shown to benefit about one in four of this 55-74-year-old population and the degree of hearing loss predicted benefit well. Overall, there was a strong correlation between benefit from amplification and from using hearing aids. Questionnaires and audiometric screens gave good screening operating characteristics. The systematic screening programme was more acceptable and gave a better response than the opportunistic. About 70% of those who were offered an aid accepted a bilateral fitting. This increased to 95% for those with > or =35 dB HL (averaged over 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz in the better ear). The retrospective case-control study showed that long-term hearing aid use was low, unless hearing impairment was quite high (e.g. >35 dB HL). Those identified early had greater benefit through additional years of use/better adaptation to use than those of the same age and hearing impairment who were fitted with hearing aids later. Different screening programmes were modelled. The 35 dB HL better ear average hearing impairment level was found to be a good, robust and justifiable target group for screening and here the most efficient and practicable method was to use two questions in primary care concerning hearing problems and a hearing screen using a pure tone at 3 kHz 35 dB HL. The average cost of the screening programme was 13 pounds per person screened or about 100 pounds if treatment costs were included. Making the conservative assumption that identification gives an extra 9 years using hearing aids, the costs of screening and intervention were in the range of 800-1000 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year when using the Health Utilities Index and about 2500 pounds using the Short Form 6 Dimensions metric. CONCLUSIONS: A simple systematic screen, using an audiometric screening instrument, has been shown to be acceptable to people in the age range 55-74 years, is likely to provide substantial benefit and may be cost-effective to those in that target group. Hearing screening appears to meet the National Screening Committee's criteria in most respects, provided screening is targeted at those with at least 35 dB HL better ear average. Based on the research carried out here there is sufficient evidence to support a larger and more definitive study of hearing screening. Further research into who should be referred for and benefit from audiological assessment and provision of hearing aid in a primary care trust setting is needed as is investigation into screening devices and the various aspects of introducing such a programme."
"BACKGROUND: Prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing due to lifestyle changes, particularly affecting those genetically at risk. We developed DiAlert as a targeted group-based intervention aimed to promote intrinsic motivation and action planning for lifestyle changes and weight loss in first degree relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.The main objective of the pilot of the DiAlert intervention was to assess fidelity, feasibility and acceptability prior to starting the randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Individuals with a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus were self-identified and screened for eligibility. DiAlert consists of two group sessions. Feasibility, fidelity, acceptability and self-reported perceptions and behavioral determinants were evaluated in a pre-post study using questionnaires and observations. Determinants of behavior change were analyzed using paired-samples t tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. RESULTS: DiAlert was delivered to two groups of first degree relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (N = 9 and N = 12). Feasibility and fidelity were confirmed. Overall, the DiAlert group sessions were positively evaluated (8.0 on a scale of 1 to 10) by participants. The intervention did not impact perceived susceptibility or worry about personal diabetes risk. Action planning with regard to changing diet and physical activity increased. CONCLUSIONS: DiAlert proved feasible and was well-accepted by participants. Positive trends in action planning indicate increased likelihood of actual behavior change following DiAlert. Testing the effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial is imperative. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherlands National Trial Register (NTR): NTR2036."
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate Telephone-Delivered Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (T-CBT) compared to CBT face to face treatment as usual (TAU-CBT), in cancer patients with high psychological needs, in terms of mental health and coping. METHOD: A prospective randomised equivalence trial with Patient Reported Outcome (PRO's), measured pre- and post-therapy including; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale: Helpless/Hopeless subscale only (MAC H/H), Checklist of Cancer Concerns (CLCC) and the Cancer Coping Questionnaire (CCQ). A study-specific Service Evaluation Questionnaire (SEQ) was include. RESULTS: Assessment of change scores, in n = 118 randomised patients referred for psychological care, indicate significant improvements (P < 0.01 or greater) for both therapy groups pre- and post-therapy in HADS anxiety, depression and total scores and cancer concerns (CLCC). Overall, for the groups combined, there is a significant shift towards reduction of CCQ stress (P = 0.028) and worry (P = 0.003) post-therapy when compared to baseline levels. Median number of therapy sessions was four. For cancer coping (CCQ) and for Mental Adjustment to Cancer (MAC) there were significant change scores only for Positive Focus and Helpless/hopeless scores respectively, in the TAU-CBT group. Although equivalence was not observed, the data demonstrate that T-CBT was non-inferior to TAU-CBT. CONCLUSIONS: Delivery of CBT to patients with clinician identified high need can be offered according to patient choice without loss of mental health benefit. Both TAU-CBT and T-CBT are effective at reducing mental health problems on the specific outcome measures."
"The dying process is characterized by feelings of sadness and fear. It is normal for patients at the end of life to worry and grieve the loss of their health. However, when these feelings become excessive and interfere with all aspects of the patient's life, they are abnormal responses to the stress of terminal illness. Screening for depression in terminally ill patients can optimize their physical comfort at the end of life and provide them the opportunity to confront and prepare for death."
"BACKGROUND: Evidence about trends in adolescent emotional problems (depression and anxiety) is inconclusive, because few studies have used comparable measures and samples at different points in time. We compared rates of adolescent emotional problems in two nationally representative English samples of youth 20 years apart using identical symptom screens in each survey. METHODS: Nationally representative community samples of 16-17-year-olds living in England in 1986 and 2006 were compared. In 1986, 4524 adolescents and 7120 parents of young people participated in the age-16-year follow-up of the 1970 British Cohort Study. In 2006, 719 adolescents and 734 parents participated in a follow-up of children sampled from the 2002/2003 Health Surveys for England. Adolescents completed the Malaise Inventory and 12-item General Health Questionnaire. Parents completed the Rutter-A scale. Individual symptoms of depression and anxiety were coded combining across relevant questionnaire items. Young people also reported frequency of feeling anxious or depressed. RESULTS: Youth- and parent-reported emotional problems were more prevalent in 2006 for girls, and rates of parent-reported problems increased for boys. Twice as many young people reported frequent feelings of depression or anxiety in 2006 as in 1986. Some symptoms showed marked change in prevalence over time (e.g., worry, irritability, fatigue), whereas others showed no change (e.g., loss of enjoyment, worthlessness). There was no evidence of differential trends in emotional problems for young people from socially advantaged and disadvantaged or intact and non-intact families. Changes in family structure and ethnic composition did not account for trends in youth emotional problems. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence for a substantial increase in adolescent emotional problems in England over recent decades, especially among girls."
"OBJECTIVES: This study explores the experience of gastrostomy insertion from the perspective of the patients and their informal carers. Gastrostomy feeding is commonly used to support motor neurone disease (MND) patients with dysphagia. However, there is lack of information describing patient and carer experiences following gastrostomy insertion. The effect of gastrostomy on quality of life for these patients and their family is currently not well understood. METHODS: Retrospective qualitative exploration using semistructured interviews with patients and their informal carers to elicit in-depth descriptions of their experiences and views following gastrostomy. RESULTS: 27 patients consented to the study; of these, 23 underwent a successful gastrostomy. 10 patients and 8 carers were interviewed, approximately 3 months following a successful gastrostomy. Participants described clinical complications, practical issues, time restrictions imposed by strict feeding regimens and psychological issues, which adversely impacted on quality of life. However, the establishment of a safe alternative route for feeding and medication, and the reduced worry over difficult meals and weight loss, were described by all as outweighing these negative impacts. Participants also described having received education/training on gastrostomy feeding both in hospital and in the community, which helped them to cope during the transition from oral to gastrostomy feeding. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the challenges and benefits of gastrostomy as well as the importance of education and information provision. Emphasis should be given to education before and after insertion along with support and care in the community. While the significant impact of gastrostomy on patients and carers should not be underestimated, the potential benefits were described as outweighing these concerns."
"The call to the Emergency Medical Dispatch Centre is often a person's first contact with the health-care system in cases of acute illness or injury and acute chest pain is a common reason for calling. The aim was to illuminate how spouses to persons with acute chest pain experienced the alarm situation, the emergency call and the prehospital emergency care. Interviews were conducted with nineteen spouses. A phenomenological-hermeneutic approach was used for the analyses. The themes responsibility and uneasiness emerged as well as an overall theme of aloneness. Being a spouse to a person in need of acute medical and nursing assistance was interpreted as ""Being responsible and trying to preserve life"" and ""Being able to manage the uneasiness and having trust in an uncertain situation."" When their partners' life was at risk the spouses were in an escalating spiral of worry, uncertainty, stress, fear of loss, feeling of loneliness and desperation. They had to manage emotional distress and felt compelled to act to preserve life, a challenging situation."
"INTRODUCTION: Xerostomia is a common complication of radiotherapy for head and neck cancer because irreparable damage is caused to the salivary glands if they are included in the radiation fields. The aim of the study was to evaluate the degree of xerostomia in survivors of head and neck cancer and to determine its impact on quality of life. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A xerostomia questionnaire consisting of three parts (xerostomia score, quality of life survey, and visual analogue scale) was completed by 75 head and neck cancer patients, more than 6 months after radiotherapy and without evidence of disease. RESULTS: The majority of patients (93%) suffered from a dry mouth, and 65% had moderate to severe xerostomia (grade 2 to 3). Both dysphagia (65%) and taste loss (63%) were common, although oral pain was less frequent (33%). The emotional impact of xerostomia was significant, causing worry (64%), tension (61%), or feelings of depression (44%). Furthermore, patients reported problems with talking to (60%) or eating with (54%) other people and to feel restricted in amount and type of food (65%). Quality of life was influenced by T classification, clinical stage, a higher radiation dose or the use of concomitant chemotherapy, but was independent of the interval since the end of radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Xerostomia after radiotherapy for head and neck cancer is extremely common and significantly affects quality of life. No recuperation is seen over time, and the use of concomitant chemotherapy significantly increases the oral complications of radiation. These results warrant the continuing efforts put into the development of salivary gland-sparing radiotherapy techniques and effective treatments of radiation-induced xerostomia."
"Delta areas such as the Netherlands are more and more at risk of future flooding due to global climate change. Motivating residents living in flood-prone areas to effectively cope with local floods may lead to minimization of material losses and loss of life. The aim of this research was to investigate whether the extent to which residents had been exposed to flooding in the past was a key factor in motivating residents to effectively cope with future flooding. We also focused on the psychological variables that mediated this relationship. We conducted a survey (N = 516) among flood victims and nonvictims. We assessed subjective experiences due to past flooding, affective and cognitive appraisals, and coping responses. Results show that victims reported stronger emotions (negative and positive), and the receipt of more social support due to past flooding than did nonvictims. Moreover, victims worry more about future flooding, perceive themselves as more vulnerable to future flooding, perceive the consequences of future flooding as more severe, and have stronger intentions to take adaptive actions in the future than nonvictims. Structural equation modeling reveals that the latter effect was fully mediated by specific experiences and appraisals. Insights into factors and processes that have the potential to motivate residents to effectively cope with future floods may prove helpful in developing interventions to inform residents how to act effectively in case of an imminent flood."
"Worry content as assessed by using a modified Worry Domains Questionnaire (WDQ) was compared among participants diagnosed with a depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and both a depressive disorder and GAD. A discriminant function analysis of worry domains yielded two significant functions. The worry domains Lack of Confidence, Aimless Future, Relationships, and Financial Concerns loaded significantly on Function 1, which was termed ""Depressive Worries."" The worry domain Loss of Control loaded significantly on Function 2, which was termed ""Anxious Worries."" The three participant groups differed in their pattern of worries in a way that lends support to the content-specificity hypothesis for both depression and anxiety. In addition, multiple regression analysis indicated that WDQ domain scores (in particular the Aimless Future domain) predicted the severity of depressive symptoms even after the variance contributed by anxiety symptoms was removed from the analysis. These findings suggest that the content of a person's worries may be significantly associated with the presence of depression, anxiety, or comorbid depression and anxiety."
"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the changes in symptoms experienced by rectal cancer patients during preoperative chemoradiotherapy, with a specific focus on fatigue and to explore how symptoms impact the quality of life. BACKGROUND: Rectal cancer continues to be a healthcare issue internationally, despite advances in management strategies, which includes the administration of preoperative chemoradiotherapy to improve locoregional control. It is known that this treatment may cause adverse effects; however, there is a paucity of literature that specifically examines fatigue, symptoms and quality of life in this patient cohort. DESIGN: A prospective, quantitative correlational design using purposive sampling was adopted. METHODS: Symptoms and quality of life were measured with validated questionnaires in 35 patients at four time points. RESULTS: Symptoms that changed significantly over time as examined using rm-anova include fatigue, bowel function issues, nutritional issues, pain, dermatological issues and urinary function issues. Findings indicate that fatigue leads to poorer quality of life, with constipation, bloating, stool frequency, appetite loss, weight worry, nausea and vomiting, dry mouth and pain also identified as influencing factors on quality of life. CONCLUSION: Findings have highlighted the importance of thorough symptom assessment and management of patients receiving preoperative chemoradiotherapy, particularly midway through treatment, in order to optimise quality of life and minimise interruptions to treatment. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Close monitoring of symptoms during preoperative chemoradiotherapy, particularly at week 4, will enable the implementation of timely interventions so that interruptions to treatment are prevented and the quality of life is optimised, which may hasten postoperative recovery times."
"Medical research shows that healthy sleep has benefits for human wellbeing. We contribute to the emerging social-epidemiological literature on the social determinants of sleep by considering how living in an area with poor economic circumstances can result in sleep loss through financial worry, uncertainty and stress. We use multilevel regression models and nationally-representative data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey (n = 9181) and find that individuals who live in areas with high unemployment rates or experience individual-level economic vulnerability sleep less than comparable individuals in areas with low unemployment rates, or who do not experience financial hardships. The negative association between local economic conditions and sleep duration is substantially stronger amongst economically vulnerable individuals. This highlights the importance of considering multiple levels in the analysis of health inequalities, as status and location can intersect to produce and reproduce disadvantage systems."
"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by constant worry or anxiety over every day life activities and events. The neurobiology of the disorder is thought to involve a wide cortical and subcortical network that includes but is not limited to the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). These two regions have been hypothesized to play different roles in stress and anxiety; the amygdala is thought to regulate responses to brief emotional stimuli while the BNST is thought to be involved in more chronic regulation of sustained anxiety. In this study, we exposed medication-free GAD patients as well as non-anxious controls to a gambling game where one of the conditions involved non-contingent monetary loss. This condition of high uncertainty was intended to elicit a stressful response and sustained anxiety. Functional MRI scans were collected simultaneously to investigate BOLD activity in the amygdala and BNST during performance of this task. Compared to controls, we found that GAD patients demonstrated decreased activity in the amygdala and increased activity in the BNST. Skin conductance measures showed a consistent early versus late effect within block where GAD patients demonstrated higher arousal than controls late in the task blocks. Based on these results, we hypothesize that GAD patients disengage the amygdala and its response to acute stress earlier than non-anxious controls making way for the BNST to maintain a more sustained response. Future studies are needed to investigate the temporal dynamics of activation and deactivation in these regions."
"OBJECTIVE: To create a taxonomy of distress and depression for use in primary care, that mirrors the thinking and practice of experienced general practitioners. DESIGN: Qualitative study, using an ethnomethodological approach, with observation of videotaped routine GP-patient consultations and in-depth interviews with GPs. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted in metropolitan Melbourne in 2005. Fourteen GPs conducted 36 patient consultations where depression was a focus; nine GPs participated in in-depth interviews to elicit details of how they recognised and diagnosed depression in their patients. RESULTS: GPs consider distress and depression in three steps. In the first step, a change in a group of symptoms and signs is observed (eg, facial expression, loss of drive). The second step categorises the syndrome according to whether or not there is an identifiable environmental cause (reactive or ""endogenous""), with the final step categorising the reactive syndromes according to their most prominent symptoms: either anxiety and worry, or helplessness and hopelessness. The resulting taxonomy includes: endogenous depression (a chronic and perhaps characterological depression characterised by a lack of interest and motivation); anxious depressive reaction (stress or worry); and hopeless depressive reaction (demoralisation). CONCLUSION: This simple and parsimonious taxonomy has validity based on its derivation from within the primary care setting."
"INTRODUCTION: The community care philosophy in Australia has led to a number of older people remaining in their own homes, dependant on others for the majority of their care needs. A small number of older people being cared for by a family member or friend will move into residential aged care facilities for full-time care. This article describes a qualitative study that explored the meanings that older rural Australian caregivers gave to their day-to-day lives after their care-receiver had entered full-time residential aged care. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with seven older caregivers were conducted to gain understandings about their 'life after placement'. Thematic analysis was employed to identify common themes. Quality of life concepts provided the boundaries to the research questions. RESULTS: The sample included four men and three women. In the study, the men reported spending more time continuing their carer role, while the women reported being more focussed on reconnecting with the community. Both men and women reported that their own health was a major constraint in being able to maintain these two tasks. The findings mirrored those of similar studies with one notable exception: this study highlighted the meanings that caregivers gave to their lives after placement in a more holistic way, as opposed to focussing on caregivers in relation to the residential aged care facility context alone. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that there are differences found in relation to gender and tasks after in-home caring roles have ended. Worry about loss of driving ability was a major concern in the caregivers' lives. The experiences of the caregivers in this study give a better understanding of what life is like for caregivers after in-home caring has ceased. Understanding of 'life after placement' expands our knowledge about carers and the role of carer. The findings suggest a need for funding and programs for caregivers after their in-home carer role has ended to assist caregivers (particularly men) in reconnecting with people and activities outside their immediate family. The findings may direct rural community development workers to appreciate the challenges that older rural caregivers face when their in-home caring role ends and visiting and socializing is dependant on their ability to drive. This study also offers a perspective for residential aged care staff to consider as they work with families placing an older family member into full-time care. If aged care staff recognise the value of the continuing caring role of the caregiver and integrate them into the care plan, enhanced positive outcomes could transpire for both caregiver and care-recipient."
"OBJECTIVE: Effective risk communication may enable clients to participate effectively in decision-making about their health and health care. A systematic review of existing literature on risk communication in genetics, and its effects on key outcomes for clients, was undertaken. METHOD: Systematic searching of six electronic databases and data extraction from included studies; narrative synthesis of results. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were included, principally from cancer genetics. Sixteen communication interventions have been evaluated, generally showing improvements in cognitive outcomes for users, such as knowledge, understanding and risk perception, and without adverse effects on anxiety, cancer-related worry and depression. However, often it was the supportive or emotional elements of counselling that provided benefits to users, rather than the informational or educational elements. Similar results were found in 12 further studies of decision aids which also appear to achieve shorter consultations that can focus more on the supportive elements of counselling. CONCLUSION: For both communication models and decision aids, the supportive or emotional elements of counselling provided more benefits to users than the informational or educational elements. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Debate is required on how to strike a balance between the medical model, its agenda and perceived requirements to disclose or discuss a range of issues and the sometimes competing goals of addressing users' concerns, needs for support, issues of loss and relationship problems."
"The increasing applications of microwaves, mainly in mobile phones and radar, induce a higher rate of exposed people, sometimes cause of worry. Eyeballs are hotspots of radiofrequency field radiation because of their anatomy and composition. We propose a review of the various effects on the eye. The studies are hardly comparable because the exposure systems, power densities and dosimetries are different. While the thermal effects on the eye are well known including cataracts, corneal edema, endothelial cell loss and retinal degeneration, the non-thermal effects are still controversial. Cell cycle abnormalities, early apoptosis were reported in experimental conditions likely due to oxidative stress, but the studies could not show any significant effect on human eyes when exposed to long-term and low-dose radiation. Next studies need to be closer to human exposure."
"The use of deception in association with sexual encounters may take many forms, ranging from outright lies to more subtle, evasive manipulations. To address such deceptions, a behavior-based sexual deception scale was developed utilizing social exchange theory. Participants were 267 individuals associated with two large universities who were surveyed regarding different aspects of their sexual deceptive behaviors. In addition, items addressing sexually related behaviors and attitudes were assessed for validation purposes. Principal components analysis identified three components of sexual deception, labeled Blatant Lying, Self-Serving, and Avoiding Confrontation. Confirmatory factor analysis verified the resulting structure, and promising validity was noted. In general, those using any of these deceptions reported more sexual partners and one-night stands. Those telling blatant lies to have sex were more likely to report greater needs for sex, while those using self-serving lies or having sex to avoid confrontation experienced greater worry about partner loss. Men were more likely to use blatant lies to have sex, while women were more likely to have sex to avoid confrontation. Results support sexual deception as an exchange process, with sex for pleasure and positive relationship outcomes acting as rewards, and unwanted sex and deception consequences as costs. Implications for health interventions and primary prevention applications are discussed."
"Conservation biologists worry that fragmenting a bloc of natural habitat might reduce its species diversity. However, they also recognize the difficulty and importance of isolating the effect of fragmentation from that of simple loss of area. Using two different methods (species-area curve and Fisher's alpha index of diversity) to analyse the species diversities of plants, tenebrionid beetles and carabid beetles in a highly fragmented Mediterranean scrub landscape, we decoupled the effect of degree of fragmentation from that of area loss. In this system, fragmentation by itself seems not to have influenced the number of species. Our results, obtained at the scale of hectares, agree with similar results at island and continent scales."
"BACKGROUND: There is currently no instrument to systematically assess the range of symptoms/problems and their bothersomeness in patients with chronic non-cancer pain (CNPN). Systematic assessment and prioritizing may target treatments and improve outcomes. METHODS: The authors developed a checklist of symptoms and problems, the Copenhagen Symptom Checklist (CSC), presented clinically by patients. Fifty-three items representing biological, psychological and social areas were selected. Symptom/problem severity was rated on a 5-point scale anchored at 0 = 'not at all' and 4 = 'severe'. Patients ranked the five most bothersome symptoms/problems and could add five open-ended items. Patients completed the CSC after the first visit at the multidisciplinary pain centre. RESULTS: One hundred and twelve consecutive patients completed the CSC. Eighty-nine percent scored pain as rather severe or very severe (score = 3 plus score = 4), followed by reduction in physical activity (67%), fatigue (66%) and sleep disturbance (53%). Pain and fatigue, but not reduction in physical activity, were given highest priority. Cognitive problems were important to a third of the patients. Depressive symptoms, cognitive problems and worry explained 17.5% of the total variance. Patients filled in the CSC without important loss of information, but a minority prioritized more than three areas or used the free text alternative. CONCLUSIONS: Patients prioritized pain and fatigue as the most burdensome symptoms, but reduction in physical activity and sleep problems were also highly ranked. Patients were positive to the idea of symptom reporting; however, the 53-item number in this version of CSC is larger than may be necessary."
"INTRODUCTION: The symptomatic heterogeneity of depression poses a barrier to understanding the smoking-depression relationship. Different types of depressive symptoms have evidenced disparate relations to smoking. Yet, depression measures employed in past depression-smoking research yield symptom subdimensions, which may not be sufficiently comprehensive or distinct. The Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS; Watson, D., O'Hara, M. W., Chmielewski, M., McDade-Montez, E. A., Koffel, E., Naragon, K., et al. (2008). Further validation of the IDAS: Evidence of convergent, discriminant, criterion, and incremental validity. Psychological Assessment, 20, 248-259. doi:10.1037/a0012570) produce 8 distinguishable depressive symptom dimensions: dysphoria (anhedonia, sadness, psychomotor disturbance, worthlessness, worry, and cognitive difficulty), lassitude (anergia and hypersomnia), suicidality (self-harm thoughts/behaviors), ill temper (anger), well-being (positive thinking), appetite loss, appetite gain, and insomnia. The present study examined common and unique relations of IDAS depression subdimensions to (a) smoking rate (cigarettes perday), (b) tobacco dependence, and (c) smoking motivation. METHODS: Secondary analysis of cross-sectional associations in baseline data collected from 338 daily smokers enrolled in a larger cessation study. RESULTS: In individual models examining each symptom dimension in isolation, each symptom dimension was significantly with associated smoking rate, tobacco dependence, and/or various aspects of smoking motivation (e.g., subjective addiction, habit, appetite control, affect modulation). In combined models including all 8 dimensions as simultaneous regressor variables, dysphoria was the only dimension to retain most of its significant associations to smoking characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Relations of depressive symptoms to tobacco dependence, smoking rate, and motivation may be explained by (a) variance specific to dysphoria symptoms and (b) shared variance across depressive symptom subdimensions. Dysphoria symptoms, which contain core DSM-IV depression criteria, may be central to depression-smoking comorbidity, whereas other symptoms may play a less prominent role."
"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to measure health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of community-dwelling patients with enterocutaneous fistulas (ECFs). DESIGN: The study was nonexperimental and used mixed methods, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative techniques to guide data collection and analysis. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Participants were recruited using a nonprobability, convenience sampling strategy. Patients living with ECFs in the community were identified by an ET nurse at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. INSTRUMENT: The questionnaire incorporated a modified version of the Stoma Quality of Life Scale (SQOLS); specifically, the term stoma was replaced with enterocutaneous fistula. The SQOLS is divided into 2 sections: The first queries overall satisfaction with life, and the second section queries 5 domains related to HRQOL, work/social functioning, sexual/body image, stoma (altered to query ECF) function, financial concerns, and skin irritation. This modified version of the SQOLS underwent face and content validation from clinicians with expertise in ECF management. METHODS: Questionnaires were distributed to eligible participants over a 20-month period in 2009 to 2010. Sixteen questionnaires were completed and returned yielding a response rate of 47.1%. RESULTS: Health-related quality of life was negatively affected by an ECF, as evidenced by low scores across all domains. The median scores for overall satisfaction with life in general in the past month were low (median scores 2.75 and 2.25, respectively) out of a possible score of 10. Respondents' median scores on 5 HRQOL domains queried by the SQOLS were also low at 25 to 39.59 out of 100. Thematic analysis of patient comments revealed a loss of normalcy, constant worry about the ECF and management of adjacent skin, depression and anxiety, and discomfort associated with presence of the ECF. The few positive comments primarily focused on support provided by family and caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study reveal that an ECF exerts a markedly negative impact on HRQOL that may be partially ameliorated by support from family and caregivers."
"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Relief from work stress has been hypothesized to explain improvements in sleep duration and quality following retirement, but this has not been confirmed with longitudinal studies. By using repeat sleep data, we examined the role of removal of work-related stressors in changes in sleep at retirement. METHODS: The study population consisted of 2,053 participants from the Finnish Retirement and Aging study. Participants' sleep duration, sleep difficulties (difficulties falling asleep, difficulties maintaining sleep, waking up too early in the morning, nonrestorative sleep), daytime tiredness, and sleep loss due to worry were assessed using surveys conducted once a year before and after retirement (average number of repeat surveys 3.5 [range 2-5] per participant). We used Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations to examine the associations between work-related stressors (job strain, low work time control, effort-reward imbalance, and organizational injustice) and changes in sleep at retirement. RESULTS: An increase in sleep duration and decrease in waking up too early in the morning, nonrestorative sleep, daytime tiredness, and sleep loss due to worry were observed shortly after retirement. No systematic associations across the work-related stressors and changes in sleep characteristics were observed. Higher number of work-related stressors before retirement was not associated with a greater magnitude of favorable changes in any of the post-retirement sleep characteristics investigated. CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study suggests that perceived sleep improves shortly after retirement, and that these changes are mainly driven by factors other than relief from work stress."
"Complaints of memory loss are frequent as one ages. Individuals worry about the presence of Alzheimer's disease, but the presence of other intact intellectual abilities is reassuring to these people. We do not know the cause of Alzheimer's disease. There are now 5.4 million confirmed cases in the United States. We know that the disease is an age-related, non-reversible brain disorder that develops over many years. Investigation is helped with the use of structural imaging (magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography). Functional imaging is also valuable. Therapy for the problem involves various drugs; these help but do not cure the difficulty."
"A needs survey was administered by mail in the Coalfields area of the Hunter region (a lower socioeconomic area around Cessnock) and in a higher socioeconomic area of Newcastle. The purpose was to assist planning for Coalfields Healthy Heartbeat--a community-action heart disease prevention program. Response rates from random samples of residents were 435/897 (49 per cent) for the Coalfields and 565/875 (65 per cent) for Newcastle. In both study areas heart attack was ranked eleventh from a list of 17 potential community worries, well below drugs, crime, road safety, the environment, cancer and 'loss of health'. Coalfields respondents were more worried about all issues on the list than were the residents in Newcastle and were less likely to have heard about recent health promotion campaigns. Coalfields respondents felt that heart disease prevention was the responsibility of the individual, the family, and the medical profession, in that order, and much less the responsibility of local community groups. Results suggest that health promotion strategies incorporating values, language and symbols that are meaningful to distinct subgroups may be more successful than disease-specific programs aimed at the general population."
"In a recent judgment on medical negligence, the Supreme Court awarded compensation amounting to Rs. 11 crore to a victim, which was to be paid by the doctors and the private hospital deemed responsible for the wrongful death of a patient. This landmark decision was by far the largest compensation award in the history of Indian medical negligence litigation. Hence, the process of calculating compensation for medical negligence has received great attention and debate, largely due to the impact that it is going to have on the practice of medicine within the country, in the near future. However, the method of calculation of compensation is unpredictable as it varies hugely across different cases, courts and tribunals resulting, in a loss of faith in the system, protracted litigation, and frequent appeals. With over 80% of India's healthcare being provided by the private sector, predictability and uniformity in the regulation of compensation in medical negligence would benefit the victims and the doctors concerned. A basic knowledge of how medical negligence compensation is calculated and adjudicated in the judicial courts of India will aid a doctor in planning his/her professional indemnity insurance, as well as in practicing his/her profession without undue worry about facing litigation for alleged medical negligence. This article addresses the merits and demerits of large compensation awards, and also discusses whether the system is broken, needs a quick fix, or a massive overhaul."
"CASE: Nicole is a beautiful 14-month wide-eyed girl who presents for routine health care maintenance in your office. Since her 9 month visit, her weight has fallen from the 25th percentile to significantly less than the 5th percentile. Her height has dropped from the 10th percentile to slightly less than the 5th percentile, while her head circumference has remained at about the 25th percentile. Her language, motor, cognitive, and social development are normal. She is 2 months late for this visit as her family has recently had significant family loss because of the earthquake in Haiti. When you take a feeding history, she seems to eat age-appropriate foods--macaroni, chicken pieces--but her mother notes that she tends to be restless and fidgety while eating and will no longer sit still in her mother's lap while she feeds her. Her stools tend to be frequent, with particles of food seen. Urine is normal. There are no symptoms of respiratory or neurological disease, and her review of systems is otherwise negative. She has been a healthy child and this is the first time they have fallen behind in routine health care maintenance visits. Her medical history is entirely unremarkable. She was born at term, weighing 3.5 kg, without any perinatal complications. The family has lived in the United States for the last 10 years. Mother recalls that there were other children in her family who were deemed small as young children but who caught up later in childhood. Mother describes a history of increased sadness and worry in the last 2 months. They receive phone calls from family in Haiti several times per week and she admits to being upset during and after these calls. When asked how the event has impacted her family, she states, ""It has rocked our entire world but Nicole is just a baby who won't eat!"" Parents are married, and there is no history of abuse or violence in the household. Her physical examination is essentially normal. Her anterior fontanelle is still open, roughly 2 cm. Two teeth (one just emerging) are present. She is alert and interactive and appears to relate well with her mother. You update her vaccinations and then struggle with where to head next."
"The objective of this study was to examine the agreement between health care professionals' (HCPs) and patients' evaluation of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) issues for cancer patients with bone metastases. A total of 413 patients and 152 HCPs were interviewed across five centres worldwide. Mean scores were almost always higher for HCPs than for patients. Patients and HCPs agreed that four issues affect HRQOL of bone metastases patients profoundly: 'long-term (chronic) pain', 'difficulty in carrying out usual daily tasks', 'able to perform self-care' and 'able to perform role functioning'. A substantial difference was found with respect to the perceived importance of psychosocial and somatic issues. Patients emphasised psychosocial issues with a particular focus on 'worry' about loss of mobility, dependence on others and disease progression, HCPs however rated 'symptom' issues as more important, specifically those related to 'pain'. In conclusion, patients and HCPs agreed that pain and physical/role functioning are important to the HRQOL of cancer patients with bone metastases, but patients also emphasized the importance of psychosocial issues to HRQOL. This information has been an important component in the development of a health-related quality of life questionnaire for patients with bone metastases (EORTC QLQ-BM 22)."
"The increase in obesity and the many educational messages prompting us to eat a healthy diet have heightened people's concerns about the effects of food choice on health and weight. An unintended side effect may be that such awareness fuels feelings of guilt and worry about food. Although guilt has the potential to motivate behaviour change, it may also lead to feelings of helplessness and loss of control. The current study examined the relationship between a default association of either 'guilt' or 'celebration' with a prototypical forbidden food item (chocolate cake), indicators of healthy eating and choosing food for mood regulation reasons. Following a 'diathesis-stress' perspective, the moderating roles of depressive symptoms and stress were examined. Although a default association of guilt was found to be harmless under some circumstances (i.e. under low stress), those who associated chocolate cake with guilt (vs. celebration) reported unhealthier eating habits and lower levels of perceived behavioural control over healthy eating when under stress, rated mood regulation reasons for food choice as important irrespective of their current affective state, and did not have more positive attitudes towards healthy eating. Implications for public health messages and interventions will be discussed."
"BACKGROUND: Stress is very common psychological phenomena where medical students faced in day to day activities. Epidemiological studies have asserted that about 70-80% of the diseases may be related to stress. Research related to this stress especially among medical students is essential, considering their learning, role and responsibilities as a future physician and health intervention programs. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of stress and identify stressors among medical students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Cross-sectional study was carried out among undergraduate medical students and self administered GHQ-12 and stressor questionnaire were used to collect information regarding stress. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to calculate odds ratio (OR). RESULTS: Prevalence of stress was 94.52% and more common among females. 33.56% students felt constantly under strain and 25.34% had loss of sleep over worry. Majority of the students of all semesters had stress (P > 0.05) and stressors viz. 'competition for marks' (P = 0.005), 'frequent examination' (P = 0.001), 'difficulty in finding time for recreation' (P = 0.014) and 'being away from home' (P = 0.027) were predominantly experienced by the 1(st) year medical students. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed the causal effect of main parameter on the GHQ caseness and students who found difficulties in following teaching language among the caseness had 81.59% higher chance of developing stress (OR = 8.159, CI = 1.228-54.213). CONCLUSION: The stress experience was more common due to academics and seen among all year of medical students. Strategy development for eliminating stressors is necessary for promoting healthy life."
"In recent years, studies of essential tremor (ET) have demonstrated that the disease is associated with functionally-relevant cognitive abnormalities, a mood disturbance and other psychiatric co-morbidities, a functionally significant gait disorder, hearing deficits, and a variety of types of tremor. The tremor has been shown to be progressive in nature and quite disabling for a large number of sufferers. Also, recent clinical-epidemiological studies have linked prevalent ET to other neurodegenerative diseases and at least one study has demonstrated an increased risk of mortality in an ET cohort. While many of these studies are derived from clinic-based samples, population-based studies have also substantiated these findings, suggesting that even in the general population, the disease is associated with disability and with co-morbidity. Based on these available studies, it would seem inaccurate to append the word ""benign"" to ET. Not unlike the word ""essential"" itself, the word ""benign"" is an antiquated and outdated term that reflects an era where little was understood about ET. Historically, the general doctors who frequently encountered the disorder would educate patients that it was a benign, non-progressive condition not associated with any co-morbidity or risk of long-term worry. This notion, conceived by prior generations of physicians, is now known to be inaccurate. It is therefore our recommendation that the medical community open the dialog to consider formally discontinuing this nosology (""benign essential tremor"") and to adopt the use of the term ""essential tremor."" Use of the word ""benign"" is a mischaracterization of the disease course, and could be prove misleading especially in the evolving doctor-patient relationship. In those cases with currently-mild tremor, the nosology ""mild essential tremor"" would be a more accurate reflection of disease."
"BACKGROUND: Recruiting and retaining human participants in cancer clinical trials is challenging for many investigators. Although we expect participants to identify and weigh the benefits and burdens of research participation for themselves, it is not clear what burdens adult cancer participants perceive in relation to benefits. We identify key attributes and develop an initial conceptual framework of benefit and burden based on interviews with individuals enrolled in cancer clinical research. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 32 patients enrolled in cancer clinical trials at a large northeastern cancer center. Krueger's guidelines for qualitative methodology were followed. RESULTS: Respondents reported a range of benefits and burdens associated with research participation. Benefits such as access to needed medications that subjects otherwise might not be able to afford, early detection and monitoring of the disease, potential for remission or cure, and the ability to take control of their lives through actively participating in the trial were identified. Burdens included the potentiality of side effects, worry and fear of the unknown, loss of job support, and financial concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Both benefit and burden influence research participation, including recruitment and retention in clinical trials. Dimensions of benefit and burden include physical, psychological, economic, familial, and social. Understanding the benefit-burden balance involved in the voluntary consent of human subjects is a fundamental tenet of research and important to ensure that subjects have made an informed decision regarding their decision to participate in clinical research."
"OBJECTIVE: To derive an MRI score for assessing severity, therapeutic response and prognosis in acute severe inflammatory colitis. METHODS: Twenty-one patients with acute severe colitis underwent colonic MRI after admission and again (n = 16) after median 5 days of treatment. Using T2-weighted images, two radiologists in consensus graded segmental haustral loss, mesenteric and mural oedema, mural thickness, and small bowel and colonic dilatation producing a total colonic inflammatory score (TCIS, range 6-95). Pre- and post-treatment TCIS were compared, and correlated with CRP, stool frequency, and number of inpatient days (therapeutic response marker). Questionnaire assessment of patient worry, satisfaction and discomfort graded 1 (bad) to 7 (good) was administered RESULTS: Admission TCIS correlated significantly with CRP (Kendall's tau=0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.11-0.79, p = 0.006), and stool frequency (Kendall's tau 0.39, 95% CI 0.14-0.64, p = 0.02). TCIS fell after treatment (median [22 range 15-31]) to median 20 [range 8-25], p = 0.01. Admission TCIS but not CRP or stool frequency was correlated with length of inpatient stay (Kendall's tau 0.40, 95% CI 0.11-0.69, p = 0.02). Patients reported some discomfort (median score 4) during MRI. CONCLUSIONS: MRI TCIS falls after therapy, correlates with existing markers of disease severity, and in comparison may better predict therapeutic response."
"Phosphorus loss from land, due to agricultural intensification, can impair water quality. The quantity lost is a function of runoff and availability, which is affected by inputs and the ability of the soil to retain P. Losses are exacerbated if surface runoff or drainage occurs soon after P inputs (e.g. fertiliser and/or manure and dung). Strategies to mitigate P losses depend on the farming system. The first step is to maintain a farm P balance (inputs-outputs) close to zero and the agronomic optimum. The next step is to use mitigation strategies in areas that lose the most P, but occupy little of the farm or catchment's area. Focusing on these areas, termed critical source areas, is more cost-effective than farm or catchment-wide strategies. However, the worry is that mitigation strategies may not keep pace with losses due to increasing intensification. Therefore, a proactive approach is needed that identifies areas resilient to P inputs and unlikely to lose P if land use is intensified."
"AIMS: To determine key worries about hypoglycaemia among insulin-using adults with Type 2 diabetes using a focus group approach. METHODS: Thirteen focus groups were conducted in three diabetes outpatient care units and one peer support group was set up, in Germany. A total of 64 insulin-dependent adults with Type 2 diabetes (36.5% women, mean age 65.2 +/- 11.0 years) discussed their worries about hypoglycaemia. The qualitative results were assigned into thematic categories using a bottom-up coding procedure. Participants completed the Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey and demographic measures were recorded. The results of the Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey were contrasted with the focus group findings to evaluate how accurately the Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey comprehensively captures features of fear of hypoglycaemia in Type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Eight themes were identified: 'unconsciousness/death'; 'aloneness/ helplessness', 'fear of hurting somebody'; 'shame'; 'loss of physical control'; 'long-term complications'; 'diabetes self-management issues'; and 'impaired awareness'. A total of 30 participants (46.9%) scored >/=3 on at least one item of the Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey worry subscale, indicating elevated worries. The Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey comprehensively captured all identified themes. Self-efficacy with regard to diabetes self-management seemed to play an important role in fear of hypoglycaemia in Type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Given that even subclinical worries can have negative effects on quality of life and diabetes self-management, emphasis should be placed on diabetes education; in particular, to help patients to develop self-efficacy concerning diabetes self-management. The Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey comprehensively captures hypoglycaemia worries in Type 2 diabetes. Additional assessment of self-efficacy might be beneficial to identify people at risk of developing hypoglycaemia worries."
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This qualitative interview study was designed to highlight the symptoms and functional limitations experienced by patients in the year following a myocardial infarction (MI). This information can support the use or development of patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments in the post-MI population. METHODS: Individual face-to-face interviews were conducted with 38 participants who had experienced an MI (with or without ST segment elevation) within the past month to <6 months (n = 17), or 6 months to </=12 months (n = 21). Using content and thematic analysis, patient reports of symptoms and functional limitations were coded and then grouped into categories. The specific content and frequency of the symptom and functional limitation reports were summarized. RESULTS: Nearly half of all symptom expressions were related to fatigue. Within this fatigue category, patients reported experiencing general tiredness, as well as a loss of physical energy, mental energy, and/or motivation. Chest pain and discomfort, sleep disruption, and shortness of breath were also frequently reported. Additionally, patients reported emotional effects, including worry and depression, as well as a negative impact on relationships and social activities. CONCLUSIONS: Patients reported a wide variety of symptoms and functional limitations after an MI. Fatigue was the most commonly reported symptom and included several specific dimensions related to tiredness. Consideration of these concepts associated with the patient's experience following an MI may yield novel endpoints for use in clinical trials and better therapies."
"AIMS: This study was conducted in order to investigate the effect of flying on Indian male and female flight attendants (FAs), flying for over 10 years and up to 30 years. METHODS: The FAs selected for this study were subjected to the same set of conditions, such as number of hours flown per month and flight routes. Questionnaires were prepared, based on complaints heard on a regular basis, and also after talking to a small sample of FAs. Nearly 100 completed questionnaires were returned, from 500 delivered directly to FAs by post. In addition to this, we met 130 FAs either before their departure or after their arrival and secured completed questionnaires from them, being sure to maintain anonymity. RESULTS: According to this study there are five major problems faced by the FAs: Stress (88.85%). Back pain (72.65%). Loss of memory (67.47%). Headaches (58.42%). Loss of hearing (51.37%). 88.85% of FAs have reported feeling stressed 'often' or 'sometimes'. Many participants felt that if the work environment were more employee-friendly their stress level might come down. Back pain was reported by 72.65% of FAs which, according to them, could be largely remedied by being provided with better equipment and user-friendly galleys. Loss of memory was prevalent in 67.47% of FAs studied. 58.42% of FAs suffer from headaches. Stress, loss of memory and headaches seem to share the same etiology such as hypoxia, jetlag and irregular sleep. Diminished hearing, prevalent in 51.37% of FAs, was not a major cause of worry but was largely perceived as an inconvenience. CONCLUSIONS: These occupational health problems of flight attendants require serious and immediate attention."
"Behavioral factors are an integral part of the overall morbidity of patients with vertigo, dizziness, and balance disorders. Anxiety, depression, and more importantly, loss of balance confidence and sense of debility and handicap beleaguer patients with acute and chronic vestibular symptoms. Vestibular rehabilitation originated as a physical therapy, but a careful look at its research development and clinical applications show it to be as much, or perhaps more, a behavioral intervention. More patients referred for vestibular rehabilitation require habituation to chronic vestibular symptoms and motion sensitivity than compensation for active peripheral or central vestibular deficits. Vestibular rehabilitation may exert a positive effect on behavioral morbidity, but the benefits are somewhat uneven and do not always correlate with physical improvements. Health anxiety (i.e., excessive worry about the cause and consequences of physical symptoms) is an emerging concept in clinical psychiatry and psychology. It may offer an important key to understanding the debility and handicap experienced by many patients with vestibular symptoms and enhance the ability of vestibular rehabilitation to ameliorate their suffering."
"Social determinants of health describe the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age and their influence on health. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national and local levels, which are themselves influenced by policy choices. Armed conflict and forced displacement are important influences on the social determinants of health. There is limited evidence on the social determinants of health of internally displaced persons (IDPs) who have been forced from their homes due to armed conflict but remain within the borders of their country. The aim of this study was to explore the social determinants of overall physical and mental health of IDPs, including the response strategies used by IDPs to support their health needs. Northern Uganda was chosen as a case-study, and 21 face-to-face semi-structured interviews with IDPs were conducted in fifteen IDP camps between November and December 2006.The findings indicated a number of key social determinants. Experiencing traumatic events could cause ""over thinking"" which in turn could lead to ""madness"" and physical ailments. Respondents also attributed ""over thinking"" to the spirit (cen) of a killed person returning to disturb its killer. Other social determinants included overcrowding which affected physical health and contributed to an emotional sense of loss of freedom; and poverty and loss of land which affected physical health from lack of food and income, and mental health because of worry and uncertainty. Respondents also commented on how the conflict and displacement and led to changes in social and cultural norms such as increased ""adultery"", ""defilement"", and ""thieving"". Response strategies included a combination of biopsychosocial health services, traditional practices, religion, family and friends, and isolating.This study supports work exploring the political, environmental, economic, and socio-cultural determinants of health of IDPs. Addressing these determinants is essential to fundamentally improving the overall physical and mental health of IDPs."
"The public is increasingly concerned about risks associated with food. Food-borne diseases can easily mobilize public concerns and create strong emotional, behavioral, and political reactions with significant negative economic and psychosocial outcomes. This was observed in various countries globally experiencing the presence of prion disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). This study highlights case-study material from various countries for key psychosocial impacts such as the public's worry and fear vis-a-vis beef consumption and the loss of confidence and trust in authorities stemming from the occurrence and management of the BSE crisis. These psychosocial impacts and resultant public behavioral responses are presented at a number of levels including individual, family, community, and societal for several European countries, with special emphasis on the UK case study. Given failures to identify the scope of individual concern about prion diseases, and to address these concerns in decision-making processes and risk communication strategies, there remains a need for further systematic research and psychosocial monitoring of the ripple effects of BSE."
"This research examines the influence of message framing (gain vs. loss), motivational orientation (approach vs. avoidance), and gender on intentions to receive human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and HPV-/HPV vaccine-related risk perceptions among young adults ages 18-26 years. Results of an experiment show an interaction between message framing and motivational orientation in predicting intentions to receive HPV vaccination. Loss-framed messages are more persuasive than gain-framed messages for avoidance-oriented individuals, whereas both frames are equally effective for approach-oriented individuals. Gender differences in intentions to get HPV vaccination and worry about vaccine safety are found."
"PURPOSE: The outcomes of pharmacist-managed diabetes care services in a community health center were studied. METHODS: Eligible patients were over age 18 years and had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients were randomly assigned by the clinical pharmacist and nurse to the intervention group (n = 76) or control group (n = 73). Patients in the intervention group were enrolled in a pharmacist-managed diabetes care program. Patients in the control group received the standard diabetes care. The primary endpoint was reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)); secondary outcome measures included weight loss, an improved body mass index, decreased blood pressure, and an improved lipid panel. Quality-of-life measures (health level, satisfaction, impact, worry about disease, and worry about social and vocational issues) were also assessed. RESULTS: Demographic differences between groups were not remarkable. Mean HbA(1c) levels fell significantly (p < 0.05) from baseline to nine months in both groups. A difference of 1.0 was reported between the groups' HbA(1c) levels (95% confidence interval, 0.08-1.78; p < 0.05). Satisfaction level improved from 63.7 to 77.4 in the intervention group, which was significant when compared with the control group, whose satisfaction score improved from 57.0 to 63.4 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who received pharmacist-managed diabetes care demonstrated improved HbA(1c), systolic blood pressure, and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels and quality-of-life measures and met treatment goals more often than patients receiving standard care."
"Recent work on comorbidity finds evidence for hierarchical structure of mood and anxiety disorders and symptoms. This study tests whether a higher-order internalizing factor accounts for variation in depression and anxiety symptom severity and change over time in a sample experiencing a period of major life stress. Data on symptoms of depression, chronic worry, and social anxiety were collected five times across seven months from 426 individuals who had recently lost jobs. Growth models for each type of symptom found significant variation in individual trajectories. Slopes were highly correlated across symptom type, as were intercepts. Multilevel confirmatory factor analyses found evidence for a higher-order internalizing factor for both slopes and intercepts, reflective of comorbidity of depression and anxiety, with the internalizing factor accounting for 54% to 91% of the variance in slopes and intercepts of specific symptom sets, providing evidence for both a general common factor and domain-specific factors characterizing level and change in symptoms. Loadings on the higher order factors differed modestly for men and women, and when comparing African American and White participants, but did not differ by age, education, or history of depression. More distal factors including gender and history of depression were strongly associated with internalizing in the early weeks after job loss, but rates of change in internalizing were associated most strongly with reemployment. Findings suggest that stressors may contribute in different ways to the common internalizing factor as compared to variance in anxiety and depression that is independent of that factor."
"The relation between analogue generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) assessed the day before the events of September 11, 2001 (9/11) and long-term outcome was examined in 44 young adults who were directly exposed the following day to the terrorist attacks in New York City. After controlling for high exposure to the attacks, preattack analogue GAD was associated with greater social and work disability, loss of psychosocial resources, anxiety and mood symptoms, and worry, but not symptoms of posttraumatic stress, assessed 12 months after 9/11. Fear and avoidance of emotions assessed 4 months after 9/11 statistically mediated the relation between preattack analogue GAD and social and work disability, loss of psychosocial support, mood and anxiety symptoms, and worry at 12-month follow-up. Avoidance of emotions 4 months after 9/11 also mediated the relation between preattack analogue GAD and posttraumatic stress symptoms 12 months after 9/11."
"BACKGROUND: The Ostomy Adjustment Scale (OAS) has been widely used to measure the adjustment to an ostomy. Although the instrument had been used among subjects from various backgrounds, psychometric properties had never been evaluated. OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to test the psychometric properties of the OAS among Chinese colostomy patients, and the secondary aim was to examine the predictors of colostomy adjustment. METHODS: The translated OAS was tested using a convenience sample of 207 colostomy patients from a university-affiliated cancer center in China. RESULTS: The content validity of the OAS was 0.91. Four items were removed during the process of validity and reliability testing. The final Chinese version of the OAS consisted of 30 items (OAS-C-30) with 4 subscales as follows: negative affect, normal functioning, therapy attitude, and life worry. The Cronbach's alpha, the intraclass correlation, and a split-half Spearman-Brown coefficient for the total scale were 0.915, 0.902 and 0.871, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that stoma self-efficacy, stoma acceptance, excessive aerofluxus, constipation, family relationship, and body image loss were the predictors of adjustment among Chinese colostomy patients. CONCLUSION: The OAS-C-30 has been proven to be a valid and reliable measure to assess the adjustment among colostomy patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The OAS-C-30 is a useful instrument to assess and monitor the level of adjustment among patients with permanent colostomies. The identified predictor variables for adjustment also provide insights to clinicians to assist them in planning interventions to facilitate the adjustment of colostomy patients."
"INTRODUCTION: More than 70,000 new cases of bladder cancer are diagnosed in the United States annually; with 75% being non-muscle-invasive (NMIBC). Research examining sexual dysfunction in bladder cancer survivors is limited, and previous studies have focused on cystectomy patients. AIMS: To evaluate the impact of sexual dysfunction on NMIBC survivors. METHODS: Mixed-methods data collection integrated a quantitative survey (Study 1; n = 117) and semi-structured qualitative interviews (Study 2; n = 26) from a non-overlapping sample of NMIBC survivors. We performed descriptive and classification and regression tree (CART) analyses of survey data and qualitative analysis of interviews. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported sexual activity, interest in sex, and physiologic symptoms (e.g., male erectile/ejaculatory difficulties, female vaginal dryness) over the previous 4 weeks; partner communication about sexuality; contamination concerns; illness intrusiveness. RESULTS: Participants in these studies averaged 65 years of age (mean and median) and were male (77%), white (91%), and married (75%). Survey (Study 1) results linked NMIBC treatment to sexual symptoms and relationship issues. Many participants reported sexual inactivity (38.8%). Sexually active participants reported erectile difficulties (60.0%), vaginal dryness (62.5%), and worry about contaminating partner with treatment agents (23.2%). While almost one-half reported the usefulness of talking with partners about sexual function, only one-fifth of participants reported sharing all concerns with their partners. CART analysis supported the importance of communication. One-half of interviewees (Study 2) reported sexual dysfunction. Two-thirds reported negative impacts on their relationships, including perceived loss of intimacy and divorce; over one-third were sexually inactive for fear of contaminating their partner or spreading NMIBC. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors' sexual symptoms may result from NMIBC, comorbidities, or both. These results inform literature and practice by raising awareness about the frequency of symptoms and the impact on NMIBC survivors' intimate relationships. Further work is needed to design symptom management education programs to dispel misinformation about contamination post-treatment and improve quality of life.

"OBJECTIVES: Health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) issues of cancer patients are considered an important clinical outcome. We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of HRQOL on long-term survival outcomes in disease-free cervical cancer survivors (CCSs). METHODS: The study sample consisted of 860 disease-free CCSs from 6 Korean cancer hospitals recruited for HRQOL survey during 2005 (median time from diagnosis, 5.9 years). Health-related quality-of-life measures included the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and its Cervical Cancer Module (CX24). Survival data were retrieved from the Korean Statistical Office after 6 years from the survey. Health-related quality-of-life domains along with sociodemographic and clinicopathologic variables were analyzed as prognostic factors for survival from the date of survey. RESULTS: During the median follow-up period of 6.3 years after the survey, 30 (3.5%) patients died from all causes. Age, time since diagnosis, and physical activity were independent prognostic factors, which constituted the baseline model along with cancer stage. When HRQOL domains were tested separately against the baseline model, functional scales (physical, role, social, and emotional functioning), global health status, symptom scales (pain and appetite loss), and cervical cancer module items (body image, sexual inactivity, and sexual worry) were significantly associated with survival (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that, in addition to well-known prognostic factors, including age, time since diagnosis, and physical activity, HRQOL scores obtained from disease-free CCSs are associated with survival."
"The headache to worry about is one that is unique or different from headaches which the patient has suffered in the past. The association with the headache of meningismus or of focal neurologic symptoms of oculoparesis, other cranial nerve palsies, hemiparesis, or loss of consciousness are particularly worrisome, especially if onset is recent and acute. Headaches related to arteritis or vasculitis usually have a slower subacute course but may also produce focal neurologic deficits. For subjects over 50 years old, temporal arteritis is always a consideration and any new type of headache requires testing of the sedimentation rate to rule out this treatable but potentially devastating problem."
"PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to examine the impact of a 12-month weight loss intervention with either a low-carbohydrate or a low-fat diet on quality of life (QOL) among obese patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Participants were enrolled in a randomized trial comparing a low-carbohydrate to a low-fat diet in type 2 diabetes. QOL was assessed with the Diabetes-39 questionnaire, which measures QOL within 5 distinct scales: anxiety and worry, diabetes control, energy and mobility, social burden, and sexual functioning. Repeated measures ANOVA compared change in QOL scales at baseline and 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: Forty-six participants completed all measures. Following 12 months, there was a significant reduction in the scores related to sexual function and energy and mobility, suggesting improvement in QOL related to these domains. These changes were not significantly different between dietary arms. Changes in weight, A1C, and dietary composition were not significantly correlated with changes in QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with diabetes have various options for weight loss. Dietary interventions with either low-carbohydrate or low-fat diets may lead to some improvements in QOL in patients with type 2 diabetes."
"BACKGROUND: Trachomatous trichiasis is thought to have a profound effect on quality of life (QoL), however, there is little research in this area. We measured vision and health-related QoL in a case-control study in Amhara Region, Ethiopia. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We recruited 1000 adult trichiasis cases and 200 trichiasis-free controls, matched to every fifth trichiasis case on age (+/- two years), sex and location. Vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were measured using the WHO/PBD-VF20 and WHOQOL-BREF questionnaires. Comparisons were made using linear regression adjusted for age, sex and socioeconomic status. Trichiasis cases had substantially lower VRQoL than controls on all subscales (overall eyesight, visual symptom, general functioning and psychosocial, p<0.0001), even in the sub-group with normal vision (p<0.0001). Lower VRQoL scores in cases were associated with longer trichiasis duration, central corneal opacity, visual impairment and poor contrast sensitivity. Trichiasis cases had lower HRQoL in all domains (Physical-health, Psychological, Social, Environment, p<0.0001), lower overall QoL (mean, 34.5 v 64.6; p<0.0001) and overall health satisfaction (mean, 38.2 v 71.7; p<0.0001). This association persisted in a sub-group analysis of cases and controls with normal vision. Not having a marriage partner (p<0.0001), visual impairment (p = 0.0068), daily labouring (p<0.0001), presence of other health problems (p = 0.0018) and low self-rated wealth (p<0.0001) were independently associated with lower overall QoL scores in cases. Among cases, trichiasis caused 596 (59%) to feel embarrassed, 913 (91.3%) to worry they may lose their remaining eyesight and 681 (68.1%) to have sleep disturbance. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Trachomatous trichiasis substantially reduces vision and health related QoL and is disabling, even without visual impairment. Prompt trichiasis intervention is needed both to prevent vision loss and to alleviate physical and psychological suffering, social exclusion and improve overall well-being. Implementation of the full SAFE strategy is needed to prevent the development of trachomatous trichiasis."
"BACKGROUND: Concussion is a traumatic brain injury, resulting in the alteration of mental status with or without loss of consciousness. There is increasing awareness that recurrent concussion may contribute to long-term neurological complication. AIMS: To determine player knowledge and attitudes regarding concussion. To identify sources of information and medical care, and to estimate the incidence of concussion in this group. To determine if player gender and grade of competition are associated with differences in knowledge, attitudes, medical care, and incidence. METHODS: Five rugby teams were recruited and players invited to complete a paper-based questionnaire. The questionnaire sought information on player demographics, knowledge level, attitudes and concussion experience. RESULTS: 90.8 % of players knew they should not continue playing when concussed. 75 % of players would continue an important game even if concussed. Of those concussed, 39.1 % have tried to influence medical assessment with 78.2 % stating it is possible or quite easy to do so. Males are less likely to worry about long-term effects of concussion (chi (2) = 9.23, p = 0.026). Club players are less likely to have medical care at training (chi (2) = 28.2, p < 0.001) or matches (chi (2) = 19.47 p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Despite good knowledge of concussion complications, management players engage in unsafe behaviour with little difference between gender and competition grades. Information regarding symptoms and management should be available to all players, coaches, and parents. Provision of medical care should be mandatory at every level of competition."
"AIM: To explore the women's experiences of being booked for induction of labour for a pregnancy greater than 41 weeks gestation. PARTICIPANTS: 23 primigravidae who were booked for induction: 18 were induced (induction group) and 5 went into spontaneous labour (comparison group). METHOD: Data were collected by a series of interviews from booking to after birthing: interpretative techniques analysed verbatim transcriptions. FINDINGS: Two dimensions of being in the process of induction were identified: (1) a sense of ""Time's Up,"" when the natural, temporal aspects of pregnancy end with an imposed birth date and sequenced induction procedures and, (2) a required ""Shift in Expectations"" from the women's original plan for labour and birth. The women varied in their responses from welcoming the end of pregnancy to feeling that their body or their baby was not ready for birth. A lack of meaningful information regarding the process of induction was also identified. The comparison group focused their worry on the impact of induction on the baby whereas the induction group expressed concern about the effect on themselves and loss of a natural birth. Worries in both groups were dissipated by successfully birthing a healthy baby. IMPLICATIONS AND OUTCOMES: The findings sensitise midwives to women's possible responses to being booked for induction. Antenatal educators can use this knowledge to prepare women and their partners for required shifts in their birthing plan when induction is deemed necessary. Midwives can help women adapt their birth plans during the induction process."
"Although previous research has attempted to identify the needs of caregivers for individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), most has focused on the demands associated with the physical needs of the patient, and not on ""mental burden."" This study used the repertory grid method to capture the full range of caregivers' subjective experience, quantify their perceptions, and to acquire information that might be useful in directing remediation attempts. Within this sample, caregivers reported far greater burden from ""mental stress"" (e.g., worrying about individual's safety) than from ""physical stress"" (e.g., lifting individual into bed). Specifically, caregivers were primarily concerned about spousal safety, as this requires continuous vigilance and constant worry. Caregivers also reported experiencing ""little deaths"" as the disease progresses, related to a loss of independence for the couple, and the steady diminishment of social networks. Increasing attention on the mental burden experienced by spousal caregivers promises to increase quality of care, and quality of life for individuals with PD, by improving quality of life for the caregiver."
"Shortage of donor cornea is a significant problem in Asia, and xenocorneal transplantation is being actively studied to alleviate this problem. However, the attitudes of subjects who await corneal transplants toward xenocorneal transplantation are not known at all. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the attitudes of subjects on the waiting lists for corneal transplants, toward corneal xenotransplantation. A telephone questionnaire survey comprising six items was conducted in 132 subjects among the wait-listed individuals (n = 590) who were awaiting corneal transplantation or had undergone corneal transplantation at Seoul National University Hospital from July, 2003 to August, 2012. Among six inquiries, four questions were used to analyze attitudes toward corneal xenotransplantation. Each question pertained to (1) the acceptance of xenocorneal transplantation, (2) willingness to participate in clinical trials, (3) worries in xenocorneal transplantation, and (4) the concern of self-identity or social life after xenocorneal transplantation. To analyze demographic factors influencing the question, the subjects were arbitrarily divided into two groups: the young (age < 60 yr, n = 58) and the elderly (age >/= 60 yr, n = 74) or the less-educated (n = 53) and the well-educated with high school diploma, college graduation, or higher education (n = 79). Collected demographic data were analyzed as influencing factors on each question using a chi-square and logistic regression tests. In this study, 42.4% of the subjects (n = 56) expressed favorable views on xenocorneal transplantation using porcine corneas to cure visual loss from corneal blindness. Among those subjects expressing favorable views (n = 56), the willingness to participate in clinical trials, knowing they and their spouses must undergo long-term surveillance, was 62.5% (n = 35). There were 76.5% of subjects (n = 101) expressing worries regarding xenocorneal transplantation, while 28.8% of subjects (n = 38) expressed their concerns about self-identity or social life after xenotransplantation. Younger subjects expressed more worry about xenotransplantation than elderly subjects. The well-educated expressed less concern over self-identity and social life than the less-educated. This survey among subjects who are wait-listed for corneal transplant or who have received a corneal transplant demonstrates that there is an interest in xenocorneal transplantation as an alternate procedure, although there are worries about the procedure that should be further explored in educational campaigns and future studies of the general population."
"BACKGROUND People are not expected to die from multiple sclerosis although, as the condition progresses over a period of time, some people become increasingly disabled and will require assistance with all activities of daily living. Their partners invariably carry out these tasks. OBJECTIVE To gain a deeper understanding of the experiences of the partner living with and caring for a spouse disabled by multiple sclerosis. METHODOLOGY In a qualitative study, eight partners who live and care for a person with multiple sclerosis were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire to explore their experience of their role. RESULTS The interview transcripts were analyzed using a thematic framework approach. Codes, themes and five categories were identified, which were worry, planning, frustrations, commitment to marriage and coping strategies. These categories were examined using quotes from the transcripts as evidence. CONCLUSION This qualitative study identified that these couples had been married for at least 20 years before disability of the spouse significantly affected their lifestyle. Partners felt obliged to continue in their caring role due to a sense of duty and commitment of marriage. Partners felt a sense of loss as they prioritized the health and needs of their spouse above their own and, finally, partners lost their identity as husband/wife as they were called 'the carer'. Partners felt out of control due to the unpredictable and progressive nature of MS and because it consumed their life 24 hours every day. Partners often felt guilty at not being satisfied with their life and wanting some independence."
"AIM: Annually about 500,000 women worldwide are diagnosed with cervical cancer. For many patients, young age at the time of diagnosis and a good prognosis regarding the disease imply a long life with the side-effects and sequels of various treatment options. The present study investigated the extent to which different quality of life (QoL) domains in patients during and after treatment for cervical cancer are affected according to menopausal status, treatment status and treatment modality. METHODS: QoL data from 346 cervical cancer patients from 14 countries who were included in a cervical cancer module validation study of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of life Group were analysed according to menopausal status, treatment status and treatment modality. QOL was assessed using the EORTC Quality of life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 and the QLQ-CX24 module. Statistical analyses were performed using descriptive statistics and analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Active treatment had the strongest negative impact on 13 different QoL domains: physical, role, emotional, cognitive, social functioning, global health/QoL, fatigue, nausea and emesis, pain, appetite loss, constipation, symptom experience and sexual enjoyment. Irradiation alone +/- other therapy was associated with most symptoms of diarrhoea. Age had the most negative impact on sexual activity and the strongest positive effect on sexual worry. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that patients with cervical carcinoma had different side-effects with different impacts on QOL depending on the menopausal status and therapy modalities. Patients should be informed about the possibility that therapy may have a negative impact on QoL."
"BACKGROUND: The National Cancer Institute's Symptom Management and Health-Related Quality of Life Steering Committee held a clinical trials planning meeting (September 2011) to identify a core symptom set to be assessed across oncology trials for the purposes of better understanding treatment efficacy and toxicity and to facilitate cross-study comparisons. We report the results of an evidence-synthesis and consensus-building effort that culminated in recommendations for core symptoms to be measured in adult cancer clinical trials that include a patient-reported outcome (PRO). METHODS: We used a data-driven, consensus-building process. A panel of experts, including patient representatives, conducted a systematic review of the literature (2001-2011) and analyzed six large datasets. Results were reviewed at a multistakeholder meeting, and a final set was derived emphasizing symptom prevalence across diverse cancer populations, impact on health outcomes and quality of life, and attribution to either disease or anticancer treatment. RESULTS: We recommend that a core set of 12 symptoms--specifically fatigue, insomnia, pain, anorexia (appetite loss), dyspnea, cognitive problems, anxiety (includes worry), nausea, depression (includes sadness), sensory neuropathy, constipation, and diarrhea--be considered for inclusion in clinical trials where a PRO is measured. Inclusion of symptoms and other patient-reported endpoints should be well justified, hypothesis driven, and meaningful to patients. CONCLUSIONS: This core set will promote consistent assessment of common and clinically relevant disease- and treatment-related symptoms across cancer trials. As such, it provides a foundation to support data harmonization and continued efforts to enhance measurement of patient-centered outcomes in cancer clinical trials and observational studies."
"Providing adults tailored risk estimates of getting colorectal cancer (CRC) can increase screening. A concern is that receipt of lower risk estimates will demotivate screening; this effect may be curbed by matching level of risk with message framing. Theoretically, pairing lower risk estimates with gain-frame messages, and higher risk estimates with loss-frame messages, should increase screening and screening intentions more than pairing lower risk estimates with loss-frame messages/higher risk estimates with gain-frame messages. These effects may be mediated by how screening is construed (e.g., to find health problems vs. to reaffirm one is healthy). These predictions were tested experimentally among 560 men and women ages 50-75 who have never screened. Participants at baseline received online a tailored comparative risk estimate with gain- or loss-frame information on screening. Screening was assessed six months later. Among the 400 reached at six months, 9.5% reported screening. There were no main effects or interactions between risk feedback and framing predicting construals, screening intentions, or screening. Worry about getting CRC and screening intentions predicted screening. While hypothesized interactions were not found, future research should explore further mechanisms through which online interventions utilizing risk feedback and framing motivate screening among adults who have never screened."
"BACKGROUND: This study explores the effect of age at the time of parental cancer diagnosis or death on psychological distress and cancer risk perception in individuals undergoing genetic testing for a specific cancer susceptibility. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer-related distress, worry and risk perception were assessed in 271 applicants for genetic testing of an identified mutation in BRCA1/2 (BReast CAncer) or a HNPCC (Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer) related gene before, one week after, and six months after genetic test disclosure. The course of distress and risk perception were compared between individuals having witnessed parental cancer or loss due to cancer in childhood, adolescence, adulthood and having unaffected parents. RESULTS: Individuals with parental cancer in childhood (under age 13) reported the highest level of cancer related distress, worry and risk perception. Women having their mother affected by breast cancer in puberty (aged 10-13 years) perceived higher breast cancer risks than women with an affected mother in adulthood or without an affected mother. Individuals with an affected parent perceived cancer risks as higher than individuals without an affected parent, but were not more distressed. CONCLUSIONS: Experience of parental cancer in childhood is a risk factor for psychological distress during the genetic testing process."
"As leading barriers to specialist care, wait times are at the forefront of the Canadian healthcare policy agenda. However, knowledge is limited about how wait times affect patients' lives. We utilized the 2010 Canadian Community Health Survey to examine the experience of patients requiring a consultation with a medical specialist for a new condition. Multivariate logistic regression predicted the likelihood that a respondent self-reported his or her life was affected. Subsequent cross-tabulations determined the ways in which life was affected. Females, middle-aged respondents, new immigrants and those with low income and poor health status were more likely to report their life was affected. Worry, stress and anxiety were the most frequently reported impacts, followed by pain, stress on family/friends, deterioration of health and loss of work. Our research demonstrates a need to address the impacts of wait times on health and well-being, with a focus on particular subpopulation groups."
"Whereas changes to the existing legal situation regarding assisted suicide have been a topic of controversial debate in Germany for the last few years, this issue has long been of interest for international film-makers. Since the mid-1980s, the theme of assisted suicide has repeatedly been taken up by cinema, predominantly as central to a relationship drama. A sick person asks somebody close to them for help. Often this somebody is a physician or a nurse, ultimately an obvious way of solving the practical problem of how the assistant is to gain access to a lethal substance. At the same time, this constellation enables a physician or nurse to be forced into a dramatic conflict between professional ethics and a personal obligation towards a loved one.Alongside more classic clinical pictures such as terminal cancer, recent films about assisted suicide have featured neurodegenerative diseases and physical disabilities. Another new development is that elderly patients are no longer alone in requesting assistance; films also and increasingly portray young adults. Besides a fear of unbearable pain, more recent films have also increasingly addressed the worry that permanent nursing might be required, as well as the subjectively experienced loss of dignity. The possibilities offered by palliative care hardly play a role in feature films. However, we should not forget, that movies are fictional and orchestrated, or, in other words, they are neither educational nor documental. They neither need nor want to portray reality, although they do wish to draw upon real experiences. They exploit highly emotional and ethically controversial themes to create tensions and stir up emotions in the audience, but ultimately they seek to entertain. Movies about death and dying are always ""die-tainment""."
"AIM: This paper is a report of a study conducted to explore the transformational experiences of adult-to-adult living-donor liver transplant recipients. BACKGROUND: Living-donor liver transplant was developed to overcome the shortage of cadaveric livers available for transplantation. However, living-donor liver transplant generates multifaceted psychosocial problems for recipients. METHOD: Data were collected from 2002 to 2004 through in-depth interviews and participant observations. We adopted a phenomenological approach that examined the experience of 30 recipients. FINDINGS: We classified the experiences into three types: common, innate and unrealized. Analysis of the transcripts revealed four themes, all with associated sub-themes. The first theme, guilt and concrete issues, includes anguish when thinking about survival by hurting a potential donor and problems associated with donor and cost. The second theme, let it happen includes leave it to fate; ambivalence; and worry about the donor candidate and whether he/she will change their mind. The third theme, pain, includes extreme physical and mental pain for me and the donor; and worry about cost. The fourth theme, balancing gains and losses, includes grateful for and hoping to enjoy my new life; burden of new body; difficulty in adapting to modified life plan; and changes in family relationships. CONCLUSION: Nursing practice should be developed to (1) give support to patients and their families during decision-making; (2) give support for the dramatic life change; (3) help recipients accept the reality of the transplant; and (4) help achieve the essential balance between feelings of attainment and loss."
"INTRODUCTION: While the importance and magnitude of the burden of low back pain upon the individual is well recognized, a systematic understanding of the impact of the condition on individuals is currently hampered by the lack of an organized understanding of what aspects of a person's life are affected and the lack of comprehensive measures for these effects. The aim of the present study was to develop a conceptual and measurement model of the overall burden of low back pain from the individual's perspective using a validity-driven approach. METHODS: To define the breadth of low back pain burden we conducted three concept-mapping workshops to generate an item pool. Two face-to-face workshops (Australia) were conducted with people with low back pain and clinicians and policy-makers, respectively. A third workshop (USA) was held with international multidisciplinary experts. Multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis, participant input and thematic analyses organized participants' ideas into clusters of ideas that then informed the conceptual model. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-nine statements were generated. Considerable overlap was observed between groups, and four major clusters were observed--Psychosocial, Physical, Treatment and Employment--each with between two and six subclusters. Content analysis revealed that elements of the Psychosocial cluster were sufficiently distinct to be split into Psychological and Social, and a further cluster of elements termed Positive Effects also emerged. Finally, a hypothesized structure was proposed with six domains and 16 subdomains. New domains not previously considered in the back pain field emerged for psychometric verification: loss of independence, worry about the future, and negative or discriminatory actions by others. CONCLUSIONS: Using a grounded approach, an explicit a priori and testable model of the overall burden of low back pain has been proposed that captures the full breadth of the burden experienced by patients and observed by experts."
"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a culturally sensitive instrument that addressed how individuals express and experience depression to detect this disorder in Koreans. We also assessed the validity, reliability, and diagnostic utility of this scale (Lee and Rhee Depression Scale; LRDS). METHODS: The sample consisted of 3,697 normal adults selected from 12 administrative districts (Do) and 448 Korean patients diagnosed with depression using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders (SCID-I). Reliability was calculated using Cronbach's alpha. Construct validity, discriminant validity, and concurrent validity were also measured. Receiver-operator-characteristic (ROC) analysis was employed to evaluate diagnostic efficiency. RESULTS: The LRDS was found to be a reliable instrument (Cronbach's alpha=0.95) consisting of six factors: negative thinking about the future, negative thinking about the self, worry and agitation, depressed mood, somatization, and loss of volition. Comparison of LRDS scores discriminated the group of patients with depression from the normal individuals in the control group. The measure showed good concurrent validity in that scores were significantly and strongly correlated with scores on established scales such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), and the D scale of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-second edition (MMPI-2). Diagnostic efficiency was 77.7%, and the cut-off scores were 65 for males and 70 for females. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to develop a depression-screening scale on the basis of Korean patients' complaints about the disorder. As a culturally sensitive tool, the LRDS will be useful in clinical and research settings in Korea."
"Children with alopecia areata often have multiple patches of hair loss. When administering intralesional steroid injections, it can be difficult to monitor which areas have already been treated. Additionally, patients and their parents may worry that we did not treat all of the affected areas. We describe a simple technique to keep track of which areas have been treated."
"OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize the perceptions of emergency medicine (EM) residents and fellows of their clinical and procedural competence, as well as their attitudes, practices and perceived barriers to reporting these perceptions to their supervisors. METHODS: A Web-based survey was distributed to residents and fellows, via their residency directors, in all Canadian EM residency programs outside of Quebec. RESULTS: Of 220 residents and fellows contacted in 9 of 10 EM programs of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and 12 of 13 EM programs of The College of Family Physicians of Canada, 82 (37.3%) completed all or part of the survey. Response rates varied slightly by question; 25 of 82 re-spondents (30.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 19.9%-41.1%]) agreed with the statement, ""I sometimes feel unsafe or un-qualified with undertaking unsupervised responsibilities or procedures, but I do not report this to my senior physician"" and 32 of 81 (39.5% [95% CI 28.2%-50.8%]) had felt this within the past 6 months. Moreover, 34 of 82 (41.5% [95% CI 30.2%-52.7%]) reported their lack of competence to a supervisor half the time or less. Trainees reported worry about loss of trust, autonomy or respect (38/80, 47.5% [95% CI 35.9%-59.1%]) or reputation (32/80, 40.0% [95% CI 28.6%-51.4%]). Nights on-call (30/79, 38% [95% CI 26.6%-49.3%]), admission decisions (13/79, 16.5% [7.6%-25.3%]) and central line insertion (13/79, 16.5% [95% CI 7.6%-25.3%]) were reported to be frequently undertaken despite not feeling competent. Suggestions to improve reporting included encouragement to report without penalty (41/82, 50.0% [95% CI 38.6%-61.4%]) and a less judgmental environment (32/82, 39.0% [95% CI 27.9%-50.2%]). CONCLUSION: Emergency medicine trainees report that they frequently do not feel competent when undertaking responsibilities without supervision. Barriers to reporting these feelings or reporting adverse events appear to relate to social pressures and authority gradients. Modifications to the training culture are encouraged to improve patient safety."
