"BACKGROUND: Community violence is an important social determinant of health in many high-poverty, urban communities. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore and characterize self-described experiences of community violence among adults with chronic health conditions. DESIGN: Qualitative study design was implemented in 2017 using in-depth, semi-structured focus groups and interviews; data were collected from two clinical sites located in geographic epicenters of high violent crime in Chicago. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients, ages 35 years and older, who had at least one chronic condition. APPROACH: Data were analyzed using grounded theory and the constant comparison method. KEY RESULTS: The overall sample (N = 51) was predominantly female (67%) and black non-Hispanic (75%); a large proportion had hypertension (65%), arthritis (55%), obesity (53%), and/or diabetes (45%). The majority reported that a close friend or family member was seriously injured or killed due to community violence (71%); a similar proportion had never discussed their experiences of community violence with a healthcare provider (73%). Several major themes emerged: (1) perceived risk of being targeted, (2) chronic stress and worry, (3) hypervigilance, (4) social breakdown, (5) chronic isolation, (6) constrained choice (loss of freedom), (7) limited access to material resources, and (8) inadequate healthcare responses. CONCLUSIONS: Patients often struggled to balance the challenges imposed by community violence with the demands of living with and managing their chronic conditions. Emergent themes may inform practical targets for addressing community violence as a social determinant of health in vulnerable populations.",1
"We developed transgenic (Tg) mice modeling an autosomally inherited mitochondrial disease, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, patients with which sometimes have comorbid mood disorders. The mutant animals exhibited bipolar disorder-like phenotypes, such as a distorted day-night rhythm and a robust activity change with a period of 4-5 days, and the behavioral abnormalities were  improved by lithium. In this study, we tested the effect of electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS) on the behavioral abnormalities of the model. Electroconvulsive therapy, which has long been used in clinical practice, provides fast-acting relief to depressive patients and drug-resistant patients. We performed long-term recordings of wheel-running activity of Tg and non-Tg mice. While recording, we administrated a train of ECS to mice, six times over two weeks or three times over a week. The treatment ameliorated the distorted day-night rhythm within three times of ECS, but it had no effect on the activity change with a period of  4-5 days in the female mice. To study the mechanism of the action, we investigated whether ECS could alter the circadian phase but found no influence on the circadian clock system. The potent and fast-acting efficacy of ECS in the  mutant mice supports the predictive validity of the mice as a model of bipolar disorder. This model will be useful in developing a safe and effective alternative to lithium or electroconvulsive therapy.",0
"BACKGROUND: Fetal death causes women to experience negative feelings after the loss. These lived experiences influence the future pregnancies and maternal health of women negatively. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the experiences of women whose pregnancies were terminated because of medical indications. METHODS: A ""design for definitive status study"" type of qualitative research design was used. Ten women who were hospitalized between April and July 2017 at the Akdeniz University Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology and had subsequently experienced pregnancy loss during their hospitalization were enrolled as participants. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The pregnancy loss experiences of participants were investigated under the five main themes of (a) lived experiences before the termination of pregnancy, (b) lived experiences after pregnancy termination, (c) willingness to see the baby after termination, (d) posttermination care requirements, and (e) physical condition of hospital rooms during hospitalization. The participants expressed feelings of hope, fear, and worry over being unsuccessful before fetal death and feelings of loneliness, disappointment, blame, and avoidance after fetal death. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In the aftermath of fetal death, health professionals should use insightful and empathic communication skills to help mothers cope with their loss. In addition, some of the participants wanted to see their babies, and some did not. Thus, individualized care is very important for women who experience pregnancy loss.",1
"BACKGROUND: Headache and musculoskeletal pain are associated with both physical and mental health symptoms, which together are mutually reinforcing. Addressing mental and physical health symptoms (including pain) concomitantly may provide an effective and efficient way to improve outcomes in this population. We tested an  evidence-based, eight-session multimodal group program, the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (3RP), in patients with headache and musculoskeletal pain. A total of 109 adults (30 with headaches, 79 with musculoskeletal pain). METHODS: Participant were 109 adults (30 with headaches, 79 with musculoskeletal  pain) referred by their medical doctor, who completed a battery of questionnaires before and after completion of the 3RP. RESULTS: On average, patients with headache and musculoskeletal pain had higher pretreatment scores for anxiety, depression, and somatization symptoms than the nonpatient normative sample for the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised. Significant improvements were identified from pre- to post-treatment in all mental health symptoms (moderate to large effects) and frequency of pain and co-occurring physical health symptoms (small to moderate effects). Patients also reported significant decreases in degree of discomfort and life interference, which were relatively more modest in the musculoskeletal pain group compared with the headache group. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, results of this study suggest that the 3RP may be an effective treatment for reducing pain and psychological symptoms in patients with headaches and musculoskeletal pain. Future work is needed to evaluate the 3RP via a randomized clinical trial in these patient populations.",0
"INTRODUCTION: As Hurricane Katrina bore down on New Orleans in August 2005, the city's mandatory evacuation prompted the exodus of an estimated 80% of its 485,000 residents. According to estimates from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at least 18 states subsequently hosted more than 200,000 evacuees. HYPOTHESIS/PROBLEM: In this case study, ""Operation Helping Hands"" (OHH), the Massachusetts health and medical response in assisting Hurricane Katrina evacuees is described. Operation Helping Hands represents the largest medical response to  evacuees in recent Massachusetts history. METHODS: The data describing OHH were derived from a series of structured interviews conducted with two leading public health officials directing planning  efforts, and a sample of first responders with oversight of operations at the evacuation site. Also, a literature review was conducted to identify similar experiences, common challenges, and lessons learned. RESULTS: Activities and services were provided in the following areas: (1) administration and management; (2) medical and mental health; (3) public health;  and (4) social support. This study adds to the knowledge base for future evacuation and shelter planning, and presents a conceptual framework that could be used by other researchers and practitioners to describe the process and outcomes of similar operations. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a description of the planning and implementation efforts of the largest medical evacuee experience in recent Massachusetts history, an effort that involved multiple agencies and partners. The conceptual framework can inform future evacuation and shelter initiatives at the state and national levels, and promotes the overarching public health goal of the highest attainable standard of health for all.",0
"Lifestyle-related factors influence risk of endometrial and ovarian cancers, but  few studies have examined their joint associations with risk of these cancers. Using multivariable Cox regression models, we assessed the association of a healthy lifestyle index (HLI-a composite score (range, 0-20) involving diet, alcohol consumption, physical activity, body mass index, and smoking; higher scores represent healthier behavior) with risk of endometrial and ovarian cancers among 108,136 postmenopausal women who were recruited in the US Women's Health Initiative study between 1993 and 1998. After a median follow-up of 17.9 years, 1,435 endometrial cancer cases and 904 ovarian cancer cases had been ascertained. Women in the highest quintile of the HLI score had a lower risk of overall, type  I, well-differentiated, moderately differentiated, poorly differentiated, and localized endometrial cancer than those in the lowest quintile (for quintile 5 vs. quintile 1, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.61 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.72), HR = 0.60 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.72), HR = 0.66 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.96), HR = 0.69 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.90), HR = 0.49 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.72), and HR = 0.61 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.74), respectively). The HLI score had a weak positive association with risk of serous ovarian cancer. Our findings underscore the potential importance of a healthy lifestyle in lowering endometrial cancer risk among postmenopausal women.",0
"Little is known regarding how hypoglycemia and associated fears influence day-to-day life among adults with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) who use contemporary diabetes management strategies. To address this gap, we performed an exploratory qualitative study with five focus groups of 30 people aged 20 to 57 years with T1DM. Sessions were audiotaped and transcribed, and then analyzed. Eight themes emerged: (a) hypoglycemic worry, (b) unpredictability and loss of control, (c) contending with life stress, (d) exercise benefits and challenges, (e) a changed relationship with food, (f) sleep fears, (g) a love/hate relationship with technology, and (h) coping strategies to make it better. Fear of hypoglycemia, diabetes management, and work demands confer a high degree of stress. Challenges surround food, exercise, and sleep. Technology is important but does not relieve fear of hypoglycemia. Developing strong coping skills and creating a safety net of support are necessary.",1
"A non-pharmacological method to reduce anxiety is ""progressive relaxation"" (PR).  The aim of the method is to reduce mental stress and associated mental processes  by means of progressive suppression of muscle tension. The study was addressed to evaluate changes in brain glucose metabolism induced by PR in patients under a stressing state generated by a diagnostic medical intervention. The effect of PR  was compared to a dose of sublingual diazepam, with the prediction that both interventions would be associated with a reduction in brain metabolism. Eighty-four oncological patients were assessed with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. Maps of brain glucose distribution from 28 patients receiving PR were compared with maps from 28 patients receiving sublingual diazepam and with 28 patients with no treatment intervention. Compared to reference control subjects, the PR and diazepam groups  showed a statistically significant, bilateral and generalized cortical hypometabolism. Regions showing the most prominent changes were the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. No significant differences were identified  in the direct comparison between relaxation technique and sublingual diazepam. Our findings suggest that relaxation induced by a physical/psychological procedure can be as effective as a reference anxiolytic in reducing brain activity during a stressful state.",0
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Repetitive thought is a trans-diagnostic risk-factor for development of psychopathology. Research on repetitive thought in bereaved individuals has focused primarily on clarifying the role of rumination, repetitive thinking about past negative events and/or negative emotions. While detrimental effects of rumination have been demonstrated following bereavement, surprisingly few studies have aimed to clarify the role of worry, repetitive thinking about potential future negative events, in adjustment to loss. This study sought to fill this gap in knowledge. METHODS/DESIGN: One hundred eighty-three bereaved individuals (85.3% women) filled out questionnaires on sociodemographic and loss-related characteristics, worry, and symptom measures of depression, anxiety, and prolonged grief. After six months, 155 participants completed worry and symptom measures again. Using multiple regression analyses, concurrent and longitudinal associations between loss-related variables, worry, and symptoms of psychopathology were examined. RESULTS: Main results were that worry was strongly positively associated with symptoms of anxiety, depression and prolonged grief concurrently and also predicted higher levels of anxiety, depression and prolonged grief longitudinally. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that worry influences adjustment to bereavement negatively and may be a potential target in grief therapy, especially when aiming to reduce anxiety.",1
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Rumination, a risk factor in adjustment to bereavement, has often been considered a confrontation process. However, building on research on worry in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and rumination in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), researchers recently developed the Rumination as Avoidance Hypothesis (RAH), which states that rumination after bereavement serves to avoid the reality of the loss. In the present study, RAH was tested by investigating if rumination is associated with implicit loss avoidance. METHODS: An Approach Avoidance Task (AAT) was used to assess automatic behavior tendencies. Using a joystick, 71 persons who recently lost a first-degree relative (90.1% women), pulled stimuli toward themselves or pushed them away from themselves. Stimuli represented the loss (picture deceased + loss word), were loss-related but ambiguous (picture deceased + neutral word; picture stranger + loss word), or were non-loss-related (picture stranger + neutral word; puzzle picture + X's). RESULTS: Participants who ruminated more were relatively faster in pushing loss stimuli away from themselves and slower in pulling loss stimuli towards themselves, implying more rumination was associated with stronger implicit loss avoidance. Effects were maintained after controlling for depressive or post-traumatic stress symptom levels, but not when controlling for prolonged grief symptom levels. LIMITATIONS: Conjugally bereaved women were overrepresented in the sample, which limits generalizability of results. The study was correlational, precluding causal inferences. CONCLUSIONS: In line with RAH, rumination was positively associated with loss avoidance. This may indicate that the application of exposure-based techniques can reduce rumination and loss-related psychopathology.",1
"OBJECTIVE: Sleep difficulties are common in individuals exposed to stress or trauma, and maladaptive cognitive coping strategies, such as worry and fear of losing vigilance, as well as low social support, may further impair sleep quality. This study examined the severity and correlates of sleep difficulties in a sample of treatment-seeking veterans of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom (OEF-OIF). METHOD: A total of 167 OEF-OIF veterans seeking behavioral or primary care services completed a questionnaire containing measures of sleep quality, combat exposure, psychopathology, fear of loss of vigilance, cognitive coping strategies, and unit and postdeployment social support within 1 year of returning from deployment. RESULTS: Mean Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory scores in the full sample were indicative of severely impaired sleep. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was associated with increased sleep difficulties, most notably sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction, and sleep quality. Hierarchical regression analysis in the full sample revealed that PTSD symptoms and scores on measures of worry and fear of loss of vigilance were positively associated with sleep difficulties and that scores on a measure of unit member support were negatively associated with sleep difficulties. Among veterans with PTSD, fear of loss of vigilance was positively associated with sleep difficulties and cognitive distraction and unit member support were negatively associated with sleep difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment-seeking OEF-OIF veterans report severe sleep difficulties, with more pronounced impairment in veterans with PTSD. The results of this study suggest that interventions to mitigate worry and fear of loss of vigilance and to enhance perceived unit member support may be helpful in reducing sleep difficulties following return from deployment in this population.",1
"Our view is that insomnia may be a causal factor in the occurrence of psychotic experiences such as paranoia and hallucinations. However, the causal relationship is not established. The aim of the study was to investigate the causal role of insomnia in psychotic experiences via a sleep restriction manipulation. The study was a within-subjects crossover design that included a planned mediation analysis. Sixty-eight nonclinical volunteers underwent a sleep loss condition (restricted to 4 h sleep for 3 nights) and a control condition (standard sleep) in randomized order in 2 consecutive weeks, with a weekend washout period. Psychotic experiences (paranoia, hallucinations, grandiosity, and cognitive disorganization) and candidate mediating variables (negative affect and related processes, working memory, decision making, and perceptual processing) were assessed before and after each condition. Actigraphy verified an average sleep duration of 5 h 15 min in the sleep loss condition, vs 6 h 58 min in the control condition. After the sleep loss condition, relative to the control condition, participants reported significant increases in paranoia, hallucinations, and cognitive disorganization, with no significant changes in grandiosity. The sleep loss condition was also associated with significant increases in negative affect, negative self and other cognitions, worry, and working memory impairment. Mediation analyses indicated that changes in psychotic experiences were mediated by changes in negative affect and related processes, but not memory impairment. The overall conclusion is that insomnia has a causal role in the occurrence of certain psychotic experiences, and that a key route is via negative affect.",1
"According to Wells' metacognitive model of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD; [Wells, A. (1995). Meta-cognition and worry: A cognitive model of generalised anxiety disorder. Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy, 23, 301-320]), GAD patients attempt to suppress intrusions that trigger worry. Wells postulates that these attempts are rarely effective and may increase the frequency of worry triggers. These apparent failures are interpreted as evidence for loss of mental control, thereby exacerbating beliefs about worry uncontrollability. The current study tested these predictions. Sixty-two high worriers completed a naturalistic experiment comprising two sessions separated by 1 week. In Session 1, participants recorded their beliefs about worry in general, including its uncontrollability. They then selected a current worry and recorded how often it came to mind over the following week. The Suppression group (N=32) suppressed their chosen worry during the week. The Mention group (N=30) simply monitored its occurrence. In Session 2, Session 1 measures were repeated. Contrary to prediction, the Suppression group reported a significant increase in worry controllability in general. No shift was demonstrated by the Mention group. In addition, relative to the Mention group, the Suppression group reported more success at suppressing their chosen worries, spent less time thinking about them, and found them more controllable and less distressing. Findings are discussed within the context of Wells' model.",1
"Despite the success of available medical and psychosocial treatments, a sizable subgroup of individuals with commonly co-occurring disorders, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), fail to make sufficient treatment gains thereby prolonging their deficits in life functioning and satisfaction. Clinically, these patients often display temperamental features reflecting heightened sensitivity to underlying motivational systems related to threat/safety and reward/loss (e.g., somatic anxiety) as well as inordinate negative self-referential processing (e.g., worry, rumination). This profile may reflect disruption in two important neural networks associated with emotional/motivational salience (e.g., salience network) and self-referentiality (e.g., default network, DN). Emotion Regulation Therapy (ERT) was developed to target this hypothesized profile and its neurobehavioral markers. In the present study, 22 GAD patients (with and without MDD) completed resting state MRI scans before receiving 16 sessions of ERT. To test study these hypotheses, we examined the associations between baseline patterns of intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) of the insula and of hubs within the DN (anterior and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex [MPFC] and posterior cingulate cortex [PCC]) and treatment-related changes in worry, somatic anxiety symptoms and decentering. Results suggest that greater treatment linked reductions in worry were associated with iFC clusters in both the insular and parietal cortices. Greater treatment linked gains in decentering, a metacognitive process that involves the capacity to observe items that arise in the mind with healthy psychological distance that is targeted by ERT, was associated with iFC clusters in the anterior and posterior DN. The current study adds to the growing body of research implicating disruptions in the default and salience networks as promising targets of treatment for GAD with and without co-occurring MDD.",1
"Prior research indicates that physical health and social support have substantial influences on subjective well-being among older adults. However, little research  has examined the influences of coping style and cognitive functioning on subjective well-being among older adults. This study investigated cognitive and psychosocial predictors of subjective well-being among 129 adults, ages 65-89 years. Canonical correlation indicated that subjective well-being was characterized by two dimensions: life satisfaction and affective balance (happiness). The use of emotion-focused coping strategies and poor perceived health were associated with diminished perceptions of life satisfaction, whereas  task-oriented and avoidance-oriented coping were positively related to happiness. Cognitive functioning was positively related to life satisfaction and pleasant emotions independent of education and income.",0
"Persistent middle ear effusion in infancy and early childhood has been blamed for impairments of speech, language, cognition and psychosocial development later in life. Whether that blame is justified remains unresolved and a matter of controversy, because studies of the relationships involved have been limited and often contradictory and because none was designed so as to address the issue of causality. At issue in particular is the common practice of subjecting infants and young children with persistent otitis media with effusion (OME) to tympanostomy tube placement specifically to reduce the risk of developmental impairment. Currently children younger than age 3 years undergo an estimated 313000 tympanostomy tube placement operations per year, at a cost of about $750 million. If a causal association between early life OME and later developmental impairment were to be established, answers would also be needed to the questions whether the adverse effects of OME are linear or threshold, whether they are permanent or transient and whether they are preventable by timely tube placement. A prospective study designed to address all of these questions is currently under way at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. The study involves enrolling a large, demographically diverse sample of normal infants before 2 months of age; monitoring them for the presence or absence of otitis media throughout the first 3 years of life; identifying those in whom OME has persisted for specified minimum periods; randomly assigning those subjects either to prompt tube placement or to delayed tube placement if OME persists; and administering a battery of standardized developmental tests to those subjects and to a sample of the others at ages 3, 4 and 6 years. Details of the study design and procedures are described in this report.",1
"BACKGROUND: Dietary habits have a great influence on physiological health. Even though this fact is generally recognized, people do not eat as healthily as they  know they should. The factors that support a healthy diet, on the other hand, are not well known. It is supposed that there is a link between personal traits and dietary habits. Personal traits may also partially explain why some people manage to make healthy dietary changes while some fail to do so or are not able to try to make changes even when they desire to do so. There is some information suggesting that dispositional optimism plays a role in succeeding in improving dietary habits. The aim of this study was to determine the role of optimism and pessimism in the process of dietary changes. METHODS: Dispositional optimism and pessimism were determined using the revised Life Orientation Test in 2815 individuals (aged 52-76 years) participating in the GOAL study in the region of Lahti, Finland. The dietary habits of the study subjects were analysed. After 3 years, the subjects' dietary habits and their possible improvements were registered. The associations between dispositional optimism and pessimism, dietary habits at baseline, and possible changes in dietary habits during the follow-up were studied with logistic regression. We also studied if the dietary habits or certain lifestyle factors (e.g. physical exercising and smoking) at baseline predicted success in improving the diet. RESULTS: Pessimism seemed to correlate clearly negatively with the healthiness of the dietary habits at baseline - i.e. the higher the level of pessimism, the unhealthier the diet. Optimism also showed a correlation with dietary habits at baseline, although to a lesser extent. Those who managed to improve their dietary habits during follow-up or regarded their dietary habits as healthy enough even without a change were less pessimistic at baseline than those who failed in their attempts to improve their diet or did not even try, even when they recognized the need for a change. CONCLUSIONS: Pessimistic people are more likely to eat an unhealthy diet than others. Pessimism reduces independently the possibilities to improve dietary patterns.",0
"Introduction: At the time of selection, police personnel undergo various health and fitness tests but subsequently health assessments are not done regularly. Unhealthy lifestyle and challenging work environment predispose them to various somatic sequelae, including cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and psychological disorders, etc., There is limited epidemiological data on the morbidity profile among police personnel in India. Aim: To study the morbidity profile and the treatment-seeking behavior among police personnel in National Capital Region (NCR), India. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between May and November, 2014 on 300 police personnel working in the NCR, India. We administered a predesigned, pretested questionnaire (α = 0.63) to the study participants based on World Health Organization-STEPS tool for assessing morbidity profile, lifestyle risk factors, and treatment-seeking behavior after obtaining informed consent from the study participants. Results: Health complaints were reported by around half (n = 149, 49.6%) of the participants with the morbidity risk of 0.71 per person. The most common complaints were related to the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal system. Only around half of the affected participants took any treatment. Hospitalization rate reflected from past 1-year hospital admissions among participants was (n = 23, 7.7%). Data analysis suggested morbidity status of police personnel to be significantly associated with lifestyle risk factors such as abdominal obesity (n = 129, 86.5%), obstructive sleep apnea (n = 54, 36.2%), and distress (n = 48, 32.2%). Conclusion: Busy and challenging work life and poor control of health lead to high morbidity among police personnel. Regular health checks and lifestyle promotional activities are highly recommended to maintain a healthy police force.",0
"Five- to 13-year-old European American children (N = 76) predicted characters' decisions, emotions, and obligations in prosocial moral dilemmas. Across age, children judged that characters would feel more positive emotions helping an unfamiliar child from the racial in-group versus out-group (African American), happier ignoring the needs of a child from the racial out-group versus in-group,  and greater obligation to help a child from the racial in-group versus out-group. Situations varied by whether the race of the needy child matched versus mismatched that of the focal character. With increasing age, children attributed  more positive emotions to people who sacrifice their own desires to help needy others as well as became more discriminating about the situations that call for altruistic action.",0
"In April 2008, the Medical Advisory Secretariat began an evidence-based review of the literature concerning pressure ulcers.Please visit the Medical Advisory Secretariat Web site, http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/providers/program/mas/tech/tech_mn.html to review these titles that are currently available within the Pressure Ulcers series.PRESSURE ULCER PREVENTION: an evidence based analysisThe cost-effectiveness of prevention strategies for pressure ulcers in long-term care homes in Ontario: projections of the Ontario Pressure Ulcer Model (field evaluation)MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC PRESSURE ULCERS: an evidence-based analysisOBJECTIVE: The Medical Advisory Secretariat (MAS) conducted a systematic  review on interventions used to treat pressure ulcers in order to answer the following questions: Do currently available interventions for the treatment of pressure ulcers increase the healing rate of pressure ulcers compared with standard care, a placebo, or other similar interventions?Within each category of  intervention, which one is most effective in promoting the healing of existing pressure ulcers? BACKGROUND: A pressure ulcer is a localized injury to the skin and/or underlying  tissue usually over a bony prominence, as a result of pressure, or pressure in conjunction with shear and/or friction. Many areas of the body, especially the sacrum and the heel, are prone to the development of pressure ulcers. People with impaired mobility (e.g., stroke or spinal cord injury patients) are most vulnerable to pressure ulcers. Other factors that predispose people to pressure ulcer formation are poor nutrition, poor sensation, urinary and fecal incontinence, and poor overall physical and mental health. The prevalence of pressure ulcers in Ontario has been estimated to range from a median of 22.1% in  community settings to a median of 29.9% in nonacute care facilities. Pressure ulcers have been shown to increase the risk of mortality among geriatric patients by as much as 400%, to increase the frequency and duration of hospitalization, and to decrease the quality of life of affected patients. The cost of treating pressure ulcers has been estimated at approximately $9,000 (Cdn) per patient per  month in the community setting. Considering the high prevalence of pressure ulcers in the Ontario health care system, the total cost of treating pressure ulcers is substantial. TECHNOLOGY: Wounds normally heal in 3 phases (inflammatory phase, a proliferative phase of new tissue and matrix formation, and a remodelling phase). However, pressure ulcers often fail to progress past the inflammatory stage. Current practice for treating pressure ulcers includes treating the underlying causes, debridement to remove necrotic tissues and contaminated tissues, dressings to provide a moist wound environment and to manage exudates, devices and frequent turning of patients to provide pressure relief, topical applications of biologic  agents, and nutritional support to correct nutritional deficiencies. A variety of adjunctive physical therapies are also in use. METHOD: Health technology assessment databases and medical databases were searched from 1996 (Medline), 1980 (EMBASE), and 1982 (CINAHL) systematically up  to March 2008 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the following treatments of pressure ulcers: cleansing, debridement, dressings, biological therapies, pressure-relieving devices, physical therapies, nutritional therapies, and multidisciplinary wound care teams. Full literature search strategies are reported in appendix 1. English-language studies in previous systematic reviews and studies published since the last systematic review were included if they had  more than 10 subjects, were randomized, and provided objective outcome measures on the healing of pressure ulcers. In the absence of RCTs, studies of the highest level of evidence available were included. Studies on wounds other than pressure  ulcers and on surgical treatment of pressure ulcers were excluded. A total of 18  systematic reviews, 104 RCTs, and 4 observational studies were included in this review. Data were extracted from studies using standardized forms. The quality of individual studies was assessed based on adequacy of randomization, concealment of treatment allocation, comparability of groups, blinded assessment, and intention-to-treat analysis. Meta-analysis to estimate the relative risk (RR) or  weighted mean difference (WMD) for measures of healing was performed when appropriate. A descriptive synthesis was provided where pooled analysis was not appropriate or not feasible. The quality of the overall evidence on each intervention was assessed using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) criteria. FINDINGS: Findings from the analysis of the included studies are summarized below: CLEANSING: There is no good trial evidence to support the use of any particular wound cleansing solution or technique for pressure ulcers. DEBRIDEMENT: There was no evidence that debridement using collagenase, dextranomer, cadexomer iodine, or maggots significantly improved complete healing compared with placebo.There were no statistically significant differences between enzymatic or mechanical debridement agents with the following exceptions:Papain urea resulted in better debridement than collagenase.Calcium alginate resulted in a greater reduction in ulcer size compared to dextranomer.Adding streptokinase/streptodornase to hydrogel resulted in faster debridement.Maggot debridement resulted in more complete debridement than conventional treatment.There is limited evidence on the healing effects of debridement devices. DRESSINGS: Hydrocolloid dressing was associated with almost three-times  more complete healing compared with saline gauze. There is evidence that hydrogel and hydropolymer may be associated with 50% to 70% more complete healing of pressure ulcers than hydrocolloid dressing.No statistically significant differences in complete healing were detected among other modern dressings.There  is evidence that polyurethane foam dressings and hydrocellular dressings are more absorbent and easier to remove than hydrocolloid dressings in ulcers with moderate to high exudates.In deeper ulcers (stage III and IV), the use of alginate with hydrocolloid resulted in significantly greater reduction in the size of the ulcers compared to hydrocolloid alone.Studies on sustained silver-releasing dressing demonstrated a tendency for reducing the risk of infection and promoting faster healing, but the sample sizes were too small for statistical analysis or for drawing conclusions. BIOLOGICAL THERAPIES: The efficacy of platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs), fibroblast growth factor, and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor in improving complete healing of chronic pressure ulcers has not been established.Presently only Regranex, a recombinant PDGF, has been approved by Health Canada and only for treatment of diabetic ulcers in the lower extremities.A March 2008 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) communication reported increased deaths from cancers in people given three or more prescriptions for Regranex.Limited low-quality evidence on skin matrix and engineered skin equivalent suggests a potential role  for these products in healing refractory advanced chronic pressure ulcers, but the evidence is insufficient to draw a conclusion. ADJUNCTIVE PHYSICAL THERAPY: There is evidence that electrical stimulation may result in a significantly greater reduction in the surface area and more complete healing of stage II to IV ulcers compared with sham therapy. No conclusion on the efficacy of electrotherapy can be drawn because of significant statistical heterogeneity, small sample sizes, and methodological flaws.The efficacy of other adjunctive physical therapies [electromagnetic therapy, low-level laser (LLL) therapy, ultrasound therapy, ultraviolet light therapy, and negative pressure therapy] in  improving complete closure of pressure ulcers has not been established. NUTRITION THERAPY: Supplementation with 15 grams of hydrolyzed protein 3 times daily did not affect complete healing but resulted in a 2-fold improvement in Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH) score compared with placebo.Supplementation with 200 mg of zinc three times per day did not have any significant impact on the healing of pressure ulcers compared with a placebo.Supplementation of 500 mg ascorbic acid twice daily was associated with a significantly greater decrease in the size of the ulcer compared with a placebo but did not have any significant impact on healing when compared with supplementation of 10 mg ascorbic acid three times daily.A very high protein tube feeding (25% of energy as protein) resulted  in a greater reduction in ulcer area in institutionalized tube-fed patients compared with a high protein tube feeding (16% of energy as protein).Multinutrient supplements that contain zinc, arginine, and vitamin C were associated with a greater reduction in the area of the ulcers compared with  standard hospital diet or to a standard supplement without zinc, arginine, or vitamin C.Firm conclusions cannot be drawn because of methodological flaws and small sample sizes. MULTIDISCIPLINARY WOUND CARE TEAMS: The only RCT suggests that multidisciplinary wound care teams may significantly improve healing in the  acute care setting in 8 weeks and may significantly shorten the length of hospitalization. However, since only an abstract is available, study biases cannot be assessed and no conclusions can be drawn on the quality of this evidence.",0
"BACKGROUND: An increasing importance is being placed on mental health and wellbeing at individual and population levels. While there are several interventions that have been proposed to improve wellbeing, more evidence is needed to understand which aspects of wellbeing are most influential. This study  aimed to identify key items that signal improvement of mental health and wellbeing. METHODS: Using network analysis, we identified the most central items in the graph network estimated from the well-established Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS). Results were compared across four major UK cohorts comprising a total of 47,578 individuals: the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network, the Scottish Schools Adolescent Lifestyle and Substance Use Survey, the Northern  Ireland Health Survey, and the National Child Development Study. RESULTS: Regardless of gender, the three items most central in the network were related to positive self-perception and mood: 'I have been feeling good about myself'; 'I have been feeling confident'; and 'I have been feeling cheerful'. Results were consistent across all four cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Positive self-perception and positive mood are central to psychological wellbeing. Psychotherapeutic and public mental health interventions might best promote psychological wellbeing by prioritising the improvement of self-esteem, self-confidence and cheerfulness. However, empirical testing of interventions using these key targets is needed.",0
"Diabetes Mellitus is a non-infectious disease that is caused by insulin resistance. Current case provides a detailed account of a 45-year female diagnosed with diabetes and coronary heart disease having complaints of pain in her joints, sadness and worry, unable to control anger, loss of interest in previous pleasurable activities, reduced interaction with others, and difficulty falling asleep. After assessment, patient was diagnosed with 293.83 (F06.31) depression due to diabetes and coronary heart disease, with depressive features and V61.03 (Z63.5) disruption of family by separation or divorce. Cognitive and behavioural approach was used for treatment, which significantly reduced complaints of patient.",1
"GOALS OF WORK: Corticosteroid treatments have been well documented to cause severe emotional and even psychiatric disturbances. Despite that corticosteroid use is at the core of most treatment protocols for haematological malignancies, there is a dearth of published research (and controversy in the existing research) on the emotional and psychiatric sequelae of corticosteroid use for haematology patients and its connection with pre-existing mental history. This paper aims to address this hiatus and confusion by examining the emotional and psychiatric side effects of corticosteroids on haematology patients in Australia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The findings are from a pilot study that explored the prior mental health history and effects of corticosteroid use of ten haematology  patients in Australia. Data was collected through an iterative, phenomenological, qualitative research methodology using open-ended interviews conducted at the time and location of the participant's choice. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The language texts were then entered into the QSR NUD*IST computer program and analysed thematically. MAIN RESULTS: The significant finding from the study was that corticosteroids used in haematology treatments have the potential to affect anyone and are not related to an individual's prior mental health history. No participant presented  evidence of psychiatric history or counseling and many reported emotional stability during previous times of difficulty. All participants reported emotional distress directly related to corticosteroid use. Participants reported  difficulties during the period of withdrawal from corticosteroids and relief during periods free from the administration of corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide evidence that emotional disturbances associated with corticosteroid use in haematology are a direct result of the drugs used and  not a symptom of the individual's prior emotional health. Recommendations are given which have important implications for the management, support and education of patients and their families in relation to the potential emotional side effects from steroid administration and withdrawal.",0
"BACKGROUND: Distress in cancer patients negatively affects emotions and coping abilities and can reduce treatment adherence, quality of life, and survival rates. The prevalence of distress in cancer patients has been reported at 35.1 percent and 37.8 percent, but is frequently undiagnosed. Previous studies have produced conflicting results regarding reported symptoms.This study aims to help health care providers identify symptoms correlated with distress to improve recognition and treatment. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed via medical record review of 40 adult cancer patients at the Avera Cancer Institute. Responses were compared using Pearson's chi-square test and the t-test. RESULTS: The average age of participants was 56.8 +/- 12.0, and 65 percent had breast cancer. The mean overall score for distress was 4.6 +/- 2.7 points on a 0-10 scale (95 percent CI 3.71 - 5.45). Twenty-four patients (60 percent) reported clinically significant distress. Females were more likely to report sadness. Specific symptoms with a statistically significant association with a higher overall distress included: fears, depression, sleep, worry, fatigue, nervousness, eating, and loss of interest in normal activities. CONCLUSIONS: Although our sample size was small and homogeneous, the results demonstrated statistically significant associations between overall distress and the symptoms of fears, depression, sleep, worry, fatigue, nervousness, eating, and loss of interest in normal activities. These findings can increase awareness of symptoms associated with distress and allow clinicians to recommend specific interventions. Though many oncology clinics screen for distress, distress remains an important factor affecting quality of life and warrants further investigation.",1
"In this study, we examined the effect of trauma exposure on substance use behaviors, specifically tobacco and alcohol use, in a group of 84 individuals who sought supportive services after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. A self-report instrument was used to assess demographics, sensory exposure, injury, interpersonal exposure through relationship with victims, peritraumatic reaction, grief, posttraumatic stress, worry about safety, functional impairment, and changes in smoking and drinking. Those who reported increased smoking had higher scores on peritraumatic reaction, grief, posttraumatic stress, worry about safety, and trouble functioning. Those who reported increased alcohol intake had higher scores on injury, peritraumatic reaction, grief, posttraumatic stress, worry about safety, and trouble functioning. Sensory exposure and interpersonal exposure were not significantly different between those with and without increased smoking or drinking. Although no causal relationship can be assumed, our findings indicate an association of grief and posttraumatic stress with increased substance use behaviors in disaster victims.",1
"AIMS/INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the effects of a caloric restricted weight loss program with or without supervised resistance exercise training (EX) on diabetes-related emotional distress and quality of life (QOL) in overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a parallel design, 106 men and women with type 2 diabetes were randomized to a prescriptive 16-week caloric restricted diet (D; 6,000-7,000 kJ/day), with (n = 65) or without (n = 41) EX (three times per week). Bodyweight, glycated hemoglobin, diabetes-specific emotional distress (Problem Areas in Diabetes [PAID] questionnaire) and QOL (Diabetes-39 [D-39] questionnaire) was assessed pre- and post-intervention. RESULTS: A total of 84 participants completed the study (D n = 33, D + EX n = 51). Weight loss was significantly greater in D + EX compared with D (-11.4 +/- 5.8 vs -8.8 +/- 5.8 kg, P = 0.04 time x diet). Overall, there were significant improvements in glycated hemoglobin, PAID total score and the D-39 dimensions of 'diabetes control', 'anxiety and worry', 'sexual functioning', 'energy and mobility', 'overall rating of QOL' and 'severity of diabetes' (P </= 0.01 for time). The D-39 dimension, 'social burden', did not change (P = 0.07 for time). There was no difference between groups in the response for any of these variables (P >/= 0.10). CONCLUSION: A structured caloric restricted diet with or without EX improves emotional distress and QOL in overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes. This trial was registered with Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (http://www.anzctr.org.au; ACTR No: ACTRN12608000206325).",1
"Background: A number of studies report high prevalence of mental health conditions among burn patients. However there is a need to understand differences in the temporal relationship between mental health conditions and intentional and unintentional burns to hasten psychological prevention and intervention. This study aims to compare the socio-demographic profile, burn characteristics and pre- and post-burn psychiatric morbidity of burn patients by intent-of-injury. Methods: De-identified linked hospital, death and mental health (MH) case registry data of burn patients hospitalised in Western Australia between 1 January 1980 and 30 June 2012 were analysed. Crude (observed) post-burn rates of  mental health admissions were generated by burn intent-of-injury. Descriptive statistics were performed to compare the characteristics of the burn patients. Results: A total of 30,997 individuals were hospitalised for a first burn; 360 (1.2%) had self-harm burns and 206 (0.7%) assault burns. Over the study period, admission rates for assault burns increased by 4.8% per year (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.1-6.5%) and self-harm burns increased 6.9% per year (95% CI 4.8-9.1%). Self-harm and assault burns occurred mainly among those aged 15 to 44 years (median age, interquartile range (IQR): self-harm 30 years, 22-40; assault 31 years, 23-38). Those with self-harm burns had a longer index hospital  stay (median (IQR): self-harm 15 days (5-35) vs 4 days (1-11) assault vs 4 days (1-10) unintentional) and higher in-hospital mortality (7.2% self-harm vs 1.9% assault burns vs 0.8% unintentional). More than half (55.0%) of self-harm burns had a prior hospitalisation (5-year lookback) for a MH condition vs 10.7% of assault burns and 2.8% of unintentional burns. Crude post-burn rates of MH admissions per 100 person-years (PY) by intent-of-burn subgroups: self-harm 209 per 100 PY, assault burns 11 per 100 PY and unintentional burns 3 per 100 PY. Conclusions: Intentional burn patients experienced significantly higher pre- and  post-burn mental health morbidity along with significant adverse outcome in comparison with unintentional burns. Early psychological assessment and intervention could help in improving the MH of these patients.",0
"An innovative practice, therapeutic touch has been used for around ten years in the treatment of eating disorders. Delivered by nurse clinicians having received  specific training, this approach is based on nursing diagnoses which identify the major symptoms of this pathology. The support is built around the body and its perceptions. Through the helping relationship, it mobilises the patient's resources to favour a relationship of trust, a letting-go, physical, psychological and emotional relaxation, and improves the therapeutic alliance.",0
"In a study lasting 12 weeks, relaxation training was evaluated as a coping resource for cancer patients. 80 patients of both sexes were randomised to relaxation training and to a control (no training) group (40 in each). Scores for anxiety, depression and psychiatric morbidity were obtained at 0, 6 and 12 weeks  with well-known questionnaires and a new anxiety and depression scale, the effects of serious illness (ESI) scale. 71 patients (32 men and 39 women) successfully completed the study. Results showed that relaxation training and control group scores were similar at 0 weeks. Higher anxiety, depression and psychiatric morbidity scores were reported by all patients at 6 and, to a lesser  extent, at 12 weeks with greater differences in women. Female controls invariably reported significantly higher scores at 6 and 12 weeks on all indices. Male controls reported significantly higher anxiety scores only at 6 and 12 weeks.",0
"The current study examined anniversary reactions in mental health disaster relief workers following traumatic exposure at the site of the World Trade Center terrorist attacks. Despite relatively low levels of symptom reporting, workers endorsed an increase in both negative mood symptoms and functional impairment at  the one-year anniversary of their traumatic exposure (compared to 6 months postexposure). For those individuals who met at least partial criteria for PTSD immediately following exposure, overall self-reported PTSD symptoms tended to increase from 6 to 12 months. This tendency resulted specifically from an increase in hyperarousal symptoms. Although few endorsed symptoms at clinical levels, our results demonstrate that disaster relief workers may experience an increase in symptomatology at the anniversary of their traumatic exposure.",0
"BACKGROUND: Individual risk factor control improves survival in patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD). It is uncertain if multiple risk factor control further extends survival. OBJECTIVES: This study determined whether a greater number of risk factors at goal predicted improved survival in SIHD patients. METHODS: Of 2,287 participants in the COURAGE (Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation) trial, 2,102 (92%) had complete ascertainment of 6 pre-specified risk factors: systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, physical activity, diet, and body mass index. Participants received interventions to control these risk factors. The outcome measure was mortality. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 6.8 years, 473 (22.5%) subjects died. In univariate analysis, the greater the number of risk factors controlled, the higher the probability of survival (unadjusted log rank: p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, the strongest predictors at 1 year of improved survival were being a nonsmoker, regular physical activity, having a systolic blood pressure <130 mm Hg, and following the American Heart Association Step 2 diet. Baseline risk factor values and evidence-based medications did not independently  predict survival once risk factor control at 1 year was included in the model. Having 4 to 6 risk factors compared with 0 to 1 risk factor at goal predicted lower mortality (hazard ratios for 4 and 6 controlled risk factors: 0.64; 95% confidence interval: 0.41 to 0.98, and 0.27; 95% confidence interval: 0.09 to 0.79, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The greater the number of risk factors in control, the higher the probability of survival in patients with SIHD. More effective strategies are needed to achieve comprehensive risk factor control, including healthy behaviors.

"Although many women experience depressive symptoms during the first year after childbirth, the relationship between type of delivery and maternal depression is  not clear. The purpose of this study is to evaluate relationship between type of  delivery and maternal depression, between 6 to 16 months after childbirth. We performed a prospective cohort study of 558 low-socioeconomic status pregnant women without depression. All participants were recruited from primary care clinics of the public sector in three administrative districts in the Western area of the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20). Type of delivery was classified as uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery (UVD) (no episiotomy and no more than  a first-degree perineal laceration), complicated vaginal delivery (CVD) (episiotomy or more than a second-degree perineal laceration), and cesarean delivery (CD). Data about type of delivery were extracted from medical charts. Crude and adjusted risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were estimated using Poisson regression with robust variance estimates to examine the association between type of delivery with maternal depression. Among 482 women reassessed during 6 to 16 months after delivery, 18% had symptoms of depression. According to the type of delivery, 250 (51.8%), 85 (21.7%), and 147 (30.5%) were UVD, CVD,  and CD, respectively. There was no association between type of delivery and maternal depression. In comparison with women submitted to uncomplicated vaginal, women who had a cesarean or perineal trauma/episiotomy did not show greater risk  of maternal depression, in the medium to long term after delivery.",0
"To elucidate the psychiatric characteristics of mothers and the supportive behavior of their partners during late pregnancy, 131 mothers who gave birth at 2 general hospitals in City A between August 2009 and September 2010 (control group: n=90; recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) group: n=41) completed a self-administered questionnaire on four separate occasions: during late pregnancy, during hospitalization, at 1-month postpartum, and at 3-months postpartum. The RPL group had significantly (p=0.03) lower anxiety regarding potential change in their appearance than the controls, but were more likely to worry about losing their baby (58% vs. 38%) (p=0.021). At 3-months postpartum, the RPL group reported having had more stress during pregnancy than the controls (49% vs. 31%; p=0.041). There were no significant differences in state or trait anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) between the 2 groups at any of the four measurements. However, state anxiety decreased significantly throughout the hospitalization for controls (p <0.001), but did not decrease significantly for the RPL group until 3 months postpartum (p<0.05). RPL participants who expressed high satisfaction with their partners' supportive behavior received significantly greater psychological support than did participants with low satisfaction. Healthcare professionals should attempt to support both members of RPL couples.",1

"OBJECTIVE: Adequate physical activity levels and a healthy lifestyle may prevent  all kinds of non-communicable diseases, promote well-being and reduce health-care costs among perimenopausal women. This study assessed an exercise programme for perimenopausal women. METHOD: A total of 150 women (aged 45-64 years) not engaged in regular physical activity were randomly assigned to either a 16 week exercise intervention or to the control group. The study was conducted from the perspective of the National Health System. Health outcomes were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), measured by the EuroQol-5D-5L questionnaire. The total direct costs of the programme were  the costs of visits to primary care, specialty care, emergency, medicines, instructor cost and infrastructure cost. The results were expressed as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to test the robustness of the analysis. RESULTS: Mean QALYs over 16 weeks were.228 in the control group and.230 in the intervention group (mean difference: .002; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: -0.005 to 0.009). Improvements from baseline were greater in the intervention group in all dimensions of the EuroQol-5D-5L but not statistically significant. The total costs at the end of the intervention were 160.38 € in the control group and 167.80 € in the intervention group (mean difference: 7.42 €; 95%CI: -47 to 62). The exercise programme had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 4,686  €/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: The programme could be considered cost-effective, although the overall difference in health benefits and costs was very modest. Longer term follow-up is needed.",0
"Social rejection is a painful event that often increases aggression. However, the neural mechanisms of this rejection-aggression link remain unclear. A potential clue may be that rejected people often recruit the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex's (VLPFC) self-regulatory processes to manage the pain of rejection. Using functional MRI, we replicated previous links between rejection and activity in the brain's mentalizing network, social pain network and VLPFC. VLPFC recruitment during rejection was associated with greater activity in the brain's reward network (i.e. the ventral striatum) when individuals were given an opportunity to retaliate. This retaliation-related striatal response was associated with greater levels of retaliatory aggression. Dispositionally aggressive individuals exhibited less functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and the right VLPFC during aggression. This connectivity exerted a suppressing effect on dispositionally aggressive individuals' greater aggressive responses to rejection. These results help explain how the pain of rejection and reward of revenge motivate rejected people to behave aggressively.",0
"BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplants, alongside enzyme replacement therapy and good multi-disciplinary care, have dramatically improved the life expectancy in children with Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) I, with better objective and functional outcomes. Despite these improvements, children with both the attenuated (non-Hurler) and severe (Hurler) variants of the disease have marked residual morbidity. Children with MPS I suffer with head and neck disease including obstructive sleep apnoea and hearing loss. The impact of these on quality of life has been poorly researched and no previous work has been published looking at patients' perception of their own health, an important domain when considering the impact of treatment. METHODS: This exploratory qualitative study aimed to discover the effect of head and neck disease, alongside that of MPS I as a whole, on the quality of life of affected children. A grounded theory approach was used to conduct this study. Children and their parents were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews. The transcribed interviews were coded and emergent themes explored until saturation occurred. RESULTS: The families of eleven children with MPS I were interviewed, five with Hurler's and six with the attenuated non-Hurler's. Important themes to emerge were- the fear of dying associated with obstructive sleep apnoea, difficulties communicating at school due to the delayed acquisition of language, chronic pain and restricted mobility, physical differences and restricted participation in social activities such as sports secondary to the musculoskeletal disease burden. The overall theme running through the analysis was the desire to fit in with ones peers. CONCLUSION: Parents and children with MPS 1 worry about 'fitting-in' with broader society. The presence of airway disease has a profound impact on the emotional well being of parents whilst language delay and musculoskeletal disease have the biggest impact on the quality of life of the children themselves. It is important to understand the impact of MPS I on the quality of life of children and their families so that we may improve future treatment and management of this sub-group of children who have an increasing life span.",1
"People regularly form expectations about their future, and whether those expectations are positive or negative can have important consequences. So, what determines the valence of people's expectations? Research seeking to answer this  question by using an individual-differences approach has established that trait biases in optimistic/pessimistic self-beliefs and, more recently, trait biases in behavioral tendencies to weight one's past positive versus negative experiences more heavily each predict the valence of people's typical expectations. However,  these two biases do not correlate, suggesting limits on a purely individual-differences approach to predicting people's expectations. We hypothesize that, because these two biases appear to operate via distinct processes (with self-beliefs operating top-down and valence weighting bias operating bottom-up), to predict a person's expectations on a given occasion, it  is also critical to consider situational factors influencing processing style. To test this hypothesis, we investigated how an integral part of future thinking that influences processing style-mental imagery-determines each bias's influence. Two experiments measured valence weighting biases and optimistic/pessimistic self-beliefs, then manipulated whether participants formed expectations using their own first-person visual perspective (which facilitates bottom-up processes) or an external third-person visual perspective (which facilitates top-down processes). Expectations corresponded more with valence weighting biases from the first-person (vs. third-person) but more with self-beliefs from the third-person  (vs. first-person). Two additional experiments manipulated valence weighting bias, demonstrating its causal role in shaping expectations (and behaviors) with  first-person, but not third-person, imagery. These results suggest the two biases operate via distinct processes, holding implications for interventions to increase optimism. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).",0
"OBJECTIVES: A two-phase study was conducted to refine a version of Cleeland's Brief Pain Inventory (BPI, Short Form) for use in residential aged care facilities (RACFs). DESIGN: The Australian Pain Society modified Cleeland's BPI by changing numerical response options to word descriptors. In Phase I, this version was tested in RACFs to determine the feasibility of its use, its stability over time, and its internal consistency reliability. Minor modifications resulted. In Phase II, the  refined version was abbreviated, and the internal consistency reliability of this Modified Residents' Verbal BPI was examined. SETTING: RACFs. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-three residents of RACFs in Phase I, 149 in Phase II. INTERVENTION: The study revised and abbreviated the BPI to better fit it for use  in RACFs, examining the reliability of the tool. MEASUREMENTS: Mini-Mental State Examination, Global Deterioration Scale, modified BPI. RESULTS: The abbreviated tool comprises three items assessing pain intensity and  three assessing pain interference. It also includes an item to specify pain location and a movement protocol. Cronbach alpha coefficient for six intensity and interference items was 0.72 (N=106). CONCLUSION: This abbreviated tool requires further testing but has demonstrated adequate internal consistency reliability and is a brief, multidimensional tool that appears feasible for assessing pain in RACFs, including use with residents who have some cognitive impairment. It shows promise as a screening tool and may  be useful to assess the effectiveness of pain relief interventions and to measure pain prevalence.",0
"In this study we attempted to operationalize, measure, and increase happiness among people with profound disabilities. Happiness indices were defined and observed among 5 individuals. Validation measures indicated that (a) increases in happiness indices were observed when individuals were presented with most preferred stimuli relative to least preferred stimuli, (b) increases in unhappiness indices were observed when they were presented with least preferred relative to most preferred stimuli, and (c) practitioner ratings of participant happiness coincided with observed indices. Subsequently, classroom staff increased happiness indices through presentation and contingent withdrawal of activities. Results suggested that a behavioral approach can enhance happiness as one aspect of quality of life among people with profound disabilities. Research directions are offered that focus on using a behavioral approach to investigate other private events that are important among people with disabilities.",0
"The relationship of ""awareness of muscle tension"" to depth of relaxation was explored. In one experiment, accuracy of forearm flexor control was assessed using the psychophysical method of magnitude production, and depth of flexor relaxation was measured using the integrated EMG before and after EMG biofeedback training. No consistent relationship between motor-control accuracy and depth of  relaxation was found. A second, similar experiment with frontalis showed increased accuracy of frontalis control with deeper relaxation. Accuracy of passive, verbal judgments of spontaneous frontalis tension fluctuation exhibited  no clear relationship with depth of relaxation. It was concluded that forearm flexor and frontalis may be under the control of distinct mechanisms, and that afferent information probably contributes to the control of neither muscle. Three structural theories of the control mechanisms were considered, and one depending  on the central monitoring of efferent outflow (rather than afferent inflow) seemed most compatible with the frontalis data. Both flexor and frontalis data could be accounted for by a two-phase scheme combining central outflow monitoring with the monitoring of mental contents for arousal value at very low muscle tension levels.",0
"Tinnitus-related distress appears to be more strongly associated with multiple psychological factors than with any perceptual properties of tinnitus. Prior studies have not investigated the role of worry in tinnitus sufferers. Worry is a dispositional cognitive trait that involves a pervasive, non-specific, future-oriented proneness to fretting, which can foster negative affective states and catastrophic thinking about a specific trouble when the trouble is actual and present. We examined the relationship between worry and self-perceived anxiety and depressive symptoms and handicap in 54 outpatients with chronic tinnitus and sensorineural hearing loss who had been previously recruited for a randomized double-blind study on the efficacy of transmeatal low-level laser therapy for tinnitus. We measured the current anxiety and depressive symptoms with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y-1/Self-evaluation Depression Scale, the handicap with the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, and the proneness to worry with the Penn State Worry Questionnaire. For the psychoacoustic tinnitus measures, we considered the loudness match and the minimum masking level. We found that tinnitus-related anxiety and depressive symptoms and handicap were significantly associated with proneness to worry (linear regression models, p < 0.01), whereas no associations were found with the psychoacoustic measures. This suggests the usefulness of worry assessment when managing chronic tinnitus in clinical practice. Early therapeutic interventions for reducing proneness to worry may facilitate better adaptation to tinnitus.",1
"Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the symptoms experience and quality of life in patients with breast cancer receiving the taxane class of drugs. Materials and Methods: This study was performed between November 2015 March 2016 in a chemotherapy unit of a university hospital with 48 patients, who agreed to participate in the study. The Memorial Symptom Rating Score (MSAS), Socio-demographic and Clinical Features Form, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Breast (EORTC QLQ- BR23) measures specific to breast cancer were used to obtain data. Results: The average age of the patients was 45.65. The majority of patients were treated with the paclitaxel/paclitaxel+trastuzumab treatment protocol (60.42%), and more than half (54.16%) of these patients were on 5 or 6 treatments. The symptoms patients experienced the most commonly included being sensitive, weakness or energy loss and pain. The symptoms they experienced severely were included fatigue and energy loss and being sensitive. The most distressing symptoms were pain, worry, numbness in hands and feet. The overall well-being score of the patients as per the quality of life findings was 46.18+/-11.66. While the lowest score for the functional scales was in the social function subscale (66.32+/-15.18), the highest score for the symptom scales was in the pain subscale (42.01+/-15.37). The lowest score for the EORTC QLQ-BR23 scales was in the sexual life subscale (20.83+/-20.19); the highest score was in the body appearance subscale (65.8+/-23.96). Conclusion: The results of the study are thought to be helpful for the oncology nurses in evaluating the patients in all aspects and in determining priorities for care.",1
"The financial and human costs of compassion fatigue and burnout can be devastating. In the haste to ""get more done,"" are we hardwiring our caregivers for disaster? The lifestyle choices we make and the degree of self-care we practice are paramount to not only our individual quality and quantity of life and our immediate circle of influence but holds the profound potential to create  quantum change within our health care system. For nurses, who are the most influential force for health care reform in America, the time to emulate wellness has never been more critical. By creating healthy habits for ourselves, we flourish as ambassadors of self-care for our patients, families, colleagues, and  communities. As we move forward with health care reform, the most powerful influence that we, as nurse leaders can wield is to practice regular self-care, healthy lifestyles, and preventative medicine.",0
"This study examined several issues in the developmental dynamics of parents' representations of their relationship with their toddlers. The authors studied 125 mothers and their firstborn toddler sons over a 13-month period. Mothers took the Parent Development Interview twice, when children were 15 and 28 months of age. Home observations of parent-child interactions and maternal ratings of daily hassles were collected when children were 21 and 27 months of age. The 3 factors  that characterized mothers' representations of their 15-month-old firstborn sons  (Joy-Pleasure/Coherence, Anger, Guilt-Separation Distress) also fit the data very well for their 28-month-old sons. Although there were no changes in average levels of mothers' (a) joy, pleasure, and coherence and (b) guilt and separation  distress from 15 to 28 months, there was a significant increase in mothers' levels of anger. Stability analyses suggested a dynamic relationship between mothers' representations of joy, pleasure, and coherence and of anger over the 13-month period. Finally, changes in mothers' representations were predictable by positive mothering (which led to increased joy, pleasure, and coherence) and by parenting daily hassles (which led to more anger).",0
"BACKGROUND: Active and Healthy Ageing (AHA) is the process of optimizing opportunities related to health, participation, and safety in order to improve quality of life. The approach most often used to measure AHA is Rowe and Kahn's Satisfactory Ageing model. Nonetheless, this model has limitations. One of the strategic objectives of the WHO Global Strategy and Action Plan (2016) is to improve Healthy Ageing measurement. Our objectives were to compare two models of  assessing AHA and further compare the results by country and sociodemographic variables. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, observational analysis of a representative sample of the general population aged 50 years and older in Europe. The data analysed were obtained by the Study of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). The dependent variable was AHA and its dimensions, measured using the Rowe and Kahn AHA model (AHA-B) and the authors' model based on the WHO definition (AHA-BPS). A descriptive analysis and multivariate models of binary logistical regression were developed. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 52,641 participants (mean age 65.24 years [SD =  10.18; Range = 50-104], 53.2% women). Healthy Ageing prevalence in the AHA-B model was 23.5% (95%CI = 23.1%-23.9%). In the AHA-BPS model, this prevalence was  38.9%. In both models, significant variations were observed between countries, and were distributed along a north-western to south-eastern gradient. The sociodemographic variables associated with the absence of AHA were advanced age,  female sex, death of spouse, low educational level, lack of employment, and low financial status. Comparing the two models, the strength of association between absence of AHA and advanced age (85 years and older) was four times greater in the AHA-B model. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showing differences between these two models provide evidence that the AHA-BPS model does not penalize older age and is more likely to characterize AHA from a health promotion perspective.",0
"The possibility that beta-adrenoceptor blockers, especially beta 1-selective agents might inhibit platelet function is of considerable interest, as this might be of pathophysiological importance in cardiovascular diseases. Platelet function, however, is difficult to assess and in vivo related data are scarce. The effect of one week of treatment with metoprolol 200 mg/day on platelet aggregability during mental stress (colour word conflict test; CWT) and low and high dose adrenaline infusions has been evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in 10 healthy male volunteers. Platelet function in vivo was assessed using ex vivo filtragometry, and the urinary excretions of beta-thromboglobulin (HMW beta-TG) and 11-dehydro-TxB2 (a thromboxane metabolite). Conventional in vitro aggregometry and the urinary levels of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha (a prostacyclin metabolite) were also studied. During the interventions there was increased platelet aggregability in vivo, as filtragometry readings were shortened by 41 +/- 11% during high dose adrenaline infusion, urinary HMW beta-TG levels increased and urinary 11-dehydro-TxB2 tended to increase. In contrast, platelet sensitivity to ADP in vitro was reduced. The urinary 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels were increased  during the interventions. Despite the cardiovascular and biochemical signs of beta-adrenoceptor blockade at rest and during the interventions, metoprolol failed to influence platelet function in vivo, as measured by ex vivo filtragometry, or urinary HMW beta-TG or 11-dehydro-TxB2 levels. It tended rather to enhance the stress response measured by ex vivo filtragometry. Platelet aggregability in vitro and urinary 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels were not altered by metoprolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
"Personal space, defined as the distance individuals choose to maintain between themselves and others, is an indicator of affiliation and closeness. Most paradigms that measure personal space preferences involve explicit choice and therefore fail to examine the implicit aspects of such preferences. In the current study, we sought to investigate an implicit form of interpersonal space that is more closely related to real-life situations involving affiliation. We studied the effects of oxytocin (OT) on neural networks that involve affiliation  and tested the impact on personal space preferences. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study, we asked participants to choose between two rooms that  differed only in the distances between two stimuli. The stimuli were either social stimuli (two chairs) or non-social stimuli (table and plant). The behavioral results showed that OT caused participants to choose a closer space in social blocks but did not affect their choices in non-social blocks. Imaging results revealed an interaction between stimulus and treatment (OT/PL) in the dorsal striatum, an area that is related to approach motivation and is part of the reward circuitry. Specifically, OT increased activity in the dorsal striatum  in the social blocks and decreased this activity in the non-social blocks. The results of the study strengthen the social salience theory regarding OT, indicating that OT does not uniformly affect all social responses and that context has a determining impact on our behavior.",0
"The feedback negativity (FN) event-related potential (ERP) is widely studied during gambling feedback tasks. However, research on FN and anxiety is minimal and the findings are mixed. To clarify these discrepancies, the current study (N=238) used time-frequency analysis to disentangle overlapping contributions of delta (0-3Hz) and theta (3-7Hz) to feedback processing in a clinically anxious sample, with severity assessed through general worry and physiological arousal scales. Greater general worry showed enhanced delta- and theta-FN broadly across both gain and loss conditions, with theta-FN stronger for losses. Regressions indicated delta-FN maintained unique effects, accounted for theta, and explained the blunted time domain FN for general worry. Increased delta was also associated with physiological arousal, but the effects were accounted for by general worry. Broadly, anxiety-related alterations in feedback processing can be explained by an overall heightened sensitivity to feedback as represented by enhanced delta-FN in relation to the general worry facet of anxiety.",1
"OBJECTIVES: The main aim of this study was to examine the roles of physical passivity and extraversion in the relationship between daily engagement in activities and daily happiness among older adults. METHOD: A day reconstruction method was used to accurately examine day-to-day activities and happiness. In total, 438 participants completed a monthly electronic diary survey over a 2-year period, generating 79,181 reported activities and momentary happiness scores. RESULTS: The results show that happiness increases when older adults combine effortful social, physical, cognitive, and household activities with restful activities. Furthermore, participation in social activities mediated the direct relationship between extraversion and happiness. Also, individuals who score high on extraversion derive greater happiness from social activities compared with their low-extravert counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: The study extends activity theory by demonstrating that combining effortful activities with restful activities leads to greater happiness among older adults. Also, personality traits such as extraversion play a decisive role  in the kind of activities that contribute most to daily happiness.",0
"BACKGROUND: Despite recent interest in the brain/mind problem and possible organic correlates of mental disease, relatively few case studies have examined the problem concretely. The present paper describes a 66-year-old male patient with a long history of schizophrenia, whose psychotic symptoms displayed qualitative and quantitative changes after a closed-head injury. CASE REPORT: After a very disturbed childhood and youth, including several jail terms, the patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia in the early 1960s and frequently thereafter hospitalized. Visual hallucinations were the dominant symptom, and art therapy provided some relief, which led to a successful artistic career. In 1989, while actively hallucinating, he suffered a mild TBI in a pedestrian accident. Despite findings of organic dysfunction, he did not receive  full neuropsychological diagnosis and treatment until four years later, when he presented with symptoms of perseveration, hemispatial neglect, and disturbances of working memory. The patient then received an individual program of neuropsychological rehabilitation, while his treating psychiatrist gradually withdrew psychotropic medication. After a year of therapy there was marked improvement of both neuropsychological and psychiatric symptoms. At the same time, he began to paint in a completely different style. CONCLUSIONS: The case described here shows that the pathomechanisms of schizophrenia and neurobehavioral disturbances resulting from organic brain damage are not after all unrelated. Microgenetic theory can provide a basis for explaining the course of symptoms in this and similar cases, as we re-think the brain-mind relationship.",0
"Nurses are expected to care for grieving women and families suffering from perinatal loss. However, these losses can also significantly impact upon the emotional state of nurses. Failure to adjust may endanger the affected nurse's health and render him or her unable or unwilling to provide continuous quality care. There has been little prior research addressing the effect of patient perinatal loss on nurses tasked with providing nursing care. This paper focuses on internal perceptions and external stresses to explore the impact of this traumatic experience on nurses and related coping strategies. We found that nurses experience a grieving process similar to those directly suffering from perinatal loss. Nurses feel sadness, incompetence, and helplessness but dare not cry in order to protect their professional image. They may also worry about the potential legal risks of verbalizing or otherwise expressing their feelings. Strategies frequently used to adjust to the emotional strain include limiting his or her commitment to the patient, seeking emotional escape, and talking to colleagues. Therefore, it is important to develop institute- or hospital-based emotional support networks and training programs and evidence-based nursing care standards for this important issue. This paper also suggests future policies, nursing strategies and further research directions.",1
"OBJECTIVES: The goals of treating recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer are palliative, aimed at reducing symptoms and improving progression free survival. A prospective trial was conducted to determine the prevalence and severity of symptoms, and associated care needs. METHODS: Eligible women included those with persistent or recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer with an estimated life expectancy of at least 6months. The Needs at the End-of-Life Screening Tool (NEST), FACIT-Fatigue (FACIT-F), NCCN-FACT Ovarian Symptom Index [NFOSI-18]; Disease Related Symptoms (DRS), Treatment Side Effects (TSE), and Function/Well Being (F/WB) were collected at study entry, 3 and 6months. RESULTS: We enrolled 102 evaluable patients. Initiation of Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) discussions increased over time from 28% at study entry to 37% at 6months. At study entry, the most common disease-related symptoms were fatigue (92%), worry (89%), and trouble sleeping (76%); 73% reported being ""bothered by treatment side effects"", which included nausea (41%) and hair loss (51%) neither of which changed over time. The most common NEST unmet needs were in the symptom dimension. The social dimension was associated with F/WB (p=0.002) and FACIT-F (p=0.006); symptoms were associated with DRS (p=0.04), TSE (p=0.03), and FACIT-F (p=0.04); existential was not associated with any of the patient-reported symptoms; therapeutic was associated with F/WB (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In patients nearing the end of life, there are significant associations between disease and treatment related symptoms and unmet patient needs, which do not change substantially over time. Careful exploration of specific end-of-life care needs can improve patient-centered care and QOL.",1
"OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of perceived interparental relationship, family harmony and family happiness with smoking intention in never-smoking Chinese children and adolescents in Hong Kong. DESIGN, SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional surveys of 15 753 primary (grades 4-6) and 38 398 secondary (grades 7-12) never-smoking students from 71 to 75 randomly selected primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong, 2012-2013. MEASUREMENTS: Outcome variable was smoking intention which denoted any affirmative response to smoke within the coming year or when a cigarette was offered by a good friend. Exposure variables were perceived interparental relationship and family harmony each measured on a five-point scale from 'very good' to 'very bad' and perceived family happiness on a four-point scale from 'very happy' to 'not happy at all'. Potential confounders included age, sex, family structure, perceived family affluence, parental smoking and sibling smoking. RESULTS: In primary students, the adjusted ORs (AORs) (95% CI) of smoking intention generally increased with more negative perception of the family relationship: up to 3.67 (1.91 to 7.05) for interparental relationship, 7.71 (4.38 to 13.6) for family harmony and 5.40 (3.41 to 8.55) for family happiness. For secondary students, the corresponding AORs (95% CI) were 2.15 (1.64 to 2.82)  for interparental relationship, 2.98 (2.31 to 3.84) for family harmony and 2.61 (1.80 to 3.79) for family happiness. All p for trend <0.001. CONCLUSIONS: More negatively perceived interparental relationship, family harmony and family happiness were associated with higher odds of smoking intention with dose-response relationships in never-smoking Chinese children and adolescents in  Hong Kong. Children's perception of their family relationship may be an important intervening point for preventing youth from initiating smoking.",0
"A variety of delay discounting tasks are widely used in human studies designed to quantify the degree to which individuals discount the value of delayed rewards. It is currently unknown which task(s) yields the largest proportion of valid and  systematic data using standard criteria (Johnson & Bickel, 2008). The goal of this study was to compare three delay-discounting tasks on task duration and amount of valid and systematic data produced. In Experiment 1, 180 college students completed one of three tasks online (fixed alternatives, titrating, or visual analogue scale [VAS]). Invalid and nonsystematic data, identified using standard criteria, were most prevalent with the VAS (47.3% of participants). The  other tasks produced more (and similar amounts of) valid and systematic data, but required more time to complete than the VAS. Viewing systematic data as more important than completion times, Experiment 2 (n = 153 college students) sought to reduce the amount of invalid datasets in the fixed-alternatives task, and compare amounts of nonsystematic data with the titrating task. Completion times were superior in the titrating task, which produced modestly more systematic data than the fixed-alternatives task. Causes of invalid and nonsystematic data are discussed, as are methods for reducing data exclusion.",0
"Metacognition refers to thinking about one's thinking or knowing what one knows.  Research suggests that this ability is not unique to humans and may be shared with nonhuman animals. In particular, great apes have shown behaviors on a variety of tasks that are suggestive of metacognitive ability. Here we combine a  metacognitive task, the information-seeking task, with tool use and variable forms of initial information provided to chimpanzees to explore how informational states impact behavioral responses in these apes. Three chimpanzees were presented with an apparatus that contained five locations where food could be hidden. If they pointed to the correct location, they received the reward, but otherwise they did not. We first replicated several existing findings using this  method, and then tested novel hypotheses. The chimpanzees were given different types of information across the experiments. Sometimes, they were shown the location of the food reward. Other times, they were shown only one empty location, which was not useful information. The chimpanzees also could use a tool to search any of those locations before making a selection. Chimpanzees typically used the tool to search out the location of the reward when they could not already know where it was, but they did not use the tool when they already had been given that information. One chimpanzee made inferences about the location of hidden food, even when that food was never shown in that location. The final experiment involved hiding foods of differing preference values, and then presenting the chimpanzees with different initial knowledge states (i.e., where the best food was located, where the less-preferred food was located, or where no food was located). All chimpanzees used the tool when they needed to use it to find the best possible item on that trial, but responded by choosing a location immediately when they did not need the tool. This finding highlights that their behavior was not the result of a simple rule following such as pointing to where  any food had been seen.",0
"BACKGROUND: Intensive lifestyle change can treat and even reverse type 2 diabetes. Digital therapeutics have the potential to deliver lifestyle as medicine for diabetes at scale. OBJECTIVE: This 12-week study investigates the effects of a novel digital therapeutic, FareWell, on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and diabetes medication use. METHODS: Adults with type 2 diabetes and a mobile phone were recruited throughout the United States using Facebook advertisements. The intervention aim was to effect a sustainable shift to a plant-based dietary pattern and regular exercise  by advancing culinary literacy and lifestyle skill acquisition. The intervention  was delivered by an app paired with specialized human support, also delivered digitally. Health coaching was provided every 2 weeks by telephone, and a clinical team was available for participants requiring additional support. Participants self-reported current medications and HbA1c at the beginning and end of the 12-week program. Self-efficacy related to managing diabetes and maintaining dietary changes was assessed via survey. Engagement was recorded automatically through the app. RESULTS: We enrolled 118 participants with a baseline HbA1c >6.5%. Participants were 81.4% female (96/118) and resided in 38 US states with a mean age of 50.7 (SD 9.4) years, baseline body mass index of 38.1 (SD 8.8) kg/m2, and baseline HbA1c of 8.1% (SD 1.6). At 12 weeks, 86.2% (94/109) of participants were still using the app. Mean change in HbA1c was -0.8% (97/101, SD 1.3, P<.001) for those  reporting end-study data. For participants with a baseline HbA1c >7.0% who did not change medications midstudy, HbA1c change was -1.1% (67/69, SD 1.4, P<.001).  The proportion of participants with an end-study HbA1c <6.5% was 28% (22/97). After completion of the intervention, 17% (16/97) of participants reported a decrease in diabetic medication while 8% (8/97) reported an increase. A total of  57% (55/97) of participants achieved a composite outcome of reducing HbA1c, reducing diabetic medication use, or both; 92% (90/98) reported greater confidence in their ability to manage their diabetes compared to before the program, and 91% (89/98) reported greater confidence in their ability to maintain a healthy dietary pattern. Participants engaged with the app an average of 4.3 times per day. We observed a significantly greater decrease in HbA1c among participants in the highest tertile of app engagement compared to those in the lowest tertile of app engagement (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c were observed with use of  the FareWell digital therapeutic. Greater glycemic control was observed with increasing app engagement. Engagement and retention were both high in this widely distributed sample.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Women with ovarian cancer face a poor prognosis, with prolonged periods of treatment but relatively high levels of physical functioning. Their thoughts and feelings regarding the prospect of dying are complex and have not been adequately studied. Various demographic, medical and psychosocial factors were examined to determine their independent associations with fear of dying and hopelessness in a cross-sectional design. METHOD: Two hundred fifty-four ovarian cancer patients were assessed at the beginning of a new chemotherapy regimen. Separate logistic regressions were performed for worry about dying and loss of hope. For each analysis, psychosocial variables were entered after the demographic and medical variables to determine whether the psychosocial variables had an independent association with the respective outcome. RESULTS: Fifty-five percent of the sample acknowledged fear of dying, and 31.6% acknowledged loss of hope in the fight against their illness. Being younger (p = .001), being of non-Hispanic White ethnicity (p = .026), and having poorer physical well-being (p = .000) were significantly associated with worry about dying after controlling for all other variables in the model. Regarding loss of hope, depressive symptoms (p = .002), lack of social support/well-being (p = .001), and number of treatments (p = .04) were significant. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: This is one of the largest studies to examine end-of-life concerns in a sample of advanced cancer patients. Our results underscore the importance of demographic and psychosocial variables in the examination of ovarian cancer patients' end-of-life concerns. Their fears and concerns should be openly acknowledged, even when the clinical focus is still on curative treatment.",1
"The underlying cause of fibromyalgia is not known, although dysfunction of serotoninergic and noradrenergic neurotransmitters appears to play an important role in the condition. Duloxetine is a newer and better tolerated dual antidepressant that does not induce muscarinic, histaminergic or adrenergic adverse reactions, and at the same time modulates and enhances the endogenous descending system that inhibits nociception. Duloxetine reduces pain symptoms in  depression and other diseases and conditions, including fibromyalgia. Over 90% of the observed effect on pain is due to a direct analgesic effect rather than an indirect antidepressant effect. In clinical trials, pain reduction with duloxetine was not associated with its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in patients with fybromialgia. A meta-analysis of four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of duloxetine in the treatment of fibromyalgia showed  it to be significantly superior to placebo in providing pain relief, reducing fatigue and improving physical and mental performance. The results of safety studies indicate that duloxetine is safe and well tolerated. Adverse effects tend to be mild, appearing more often at the start of therapy and decreasing or disappearing over the course of continued treatment.",0
"In this paper I'm going to illustrate my experience related to the six month narrative laboratory with the psychiatric patients of the Daily Psychiatric Center located in Rutigliano. This project originated from my own way of conceiving the concept of Psychiatric and Psychosocial Rehabilitation in terms of Therapeìa, that is in my view the regaining ""sense and meaning"" as the essence of rehabilitation therapy. My goal was to awaken thoughts, words, gestures, emotions in order to reconnect an interrupted dialogue with themselves and start an initial storytelling experience. By telling this new story the relationship between the Self, the Story and the Character is recreated so that freedom and life planning are generated again. In order to ""gather unspoken yet deeply felt experiences"" I used artworks extracted from the catalogue ""tutti uguali, tutti diversi""; catalogue created during the awareness campaign and the fight against social stigma and social exclusion by Art, that the Center of Mental Health 3 - CSM 3 - in Troia (Puglia, Italy) held in 2007 in synergy with the School of Fine  Art and with the Monuments and Fine Art Department.",0
"Research has shown that intolerance of uncertainty (IU) - the tendency to react negatively to situations that are uncertain - is involved in worry and generalized anxiety disorder, as well as in other anxiety symptoms and disorders. To our knowledge, no studies have yet examined the association between IU and emotional distress connected with the death of a loved one. Yet, it seems plausible that those who have more difficulties to tolerate the uncertainties that often times occur following such a loss experience more intense distress. The current study examined this assumption, using self-reported data from 134 bereaved individuals. Findings showed that IU was positively and significantly correlated with symptom levels of complicated grief and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), even when controlling for time since loss (the single demographic/loss-related variable associated with symptom levels), and for neuroticism and worry, which are both correlates of IU. Furthermore, IU was specifically related with worry and symptom levels of PTSD, but not complicated grief, when controlling the shared variance between worry, complicated grief severity, and PTSD-severity. The present findings complement prior research that has shown that IU is a cognitive vulnerability factor for worry, and indicate that it may also be involved in emotional distress following loss.",1
"RATIONALE: Approach and avoidance decisions are made when an animal experiences a state of motivational conflict inflicted by stimuli imbued with both positive and negative valences. The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a site where valenced information and action selection converge, has recently been found to be critically involved  in the resolution of approach-avoidance conflict. However, the individual roles of the region's dopamine receptor D1 (D1R)- and D2 (D2R)-expressing medium spiny  neurons (MSNs) in regulating conflict resolution have not been well established. OBJECTIVES: Here, we examined the roles of NAc D1R and D2R in cue-elicited approach-avoidance decision-making. METHODS: Using a conditioned mixed-valence conflict paradigm, rats were initially trained in a radial maze to associate separate visuotactile cues with sucrose reward, foot shock punishment, and no outcome. Following acquisition of the cue-outcome associations, rats were subjected to a conditioned approach-avoidance conflict scenario, in which they were presented with a maze arm containing a superimposition of the reward and punishment cues, and another arm containing neutral cues. RESULTS: Post-training intra-NAc D1R antagonism (SCH23390) led to an avoidance of the arm containing the mixed-valence cue over the neutral arm, whereas intra-NAc  D2R antagonism (sulpiride) resulted in rats exhibiting a preference for the mixed-valence arm. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that NAc D1R and D2R exert differential control over decision-making involving cue-elicited approach-avoidance conflict resolution.",0
"PURPOSE: The purpose of the present article was to investigate the health related quality of life (QoL) of young women with breast cancer. METHODS: For the purposes of this article, we reviewed the literature via the electronic databases Pubmed, Scopus and Google Scholar. Key words used were breast cancer, young women, health related quality of life, and quality of life. RESULTS: Young women reported fatigue, pain in the breast and hand problems with lymphedema as the most frequent physical effects of treatment. Other physical problems were the not periodic and painful menses, vaginal dryness and loss of libido. Many young women had depressive symptoms such as depressed mood, helplessness, hopelessness, sleep loss, psychomotor retardation and disorders of appetite. There were often concerns about the health monitoring and self-image, while they were anxious if they will have a baby in the future or if they can nurture the existing ones. Many problems arose in the career of young women. They faced discrimination in the labor supply and/or layoff because they were considered unable to do their job effectively. In addition, they reported isolation problems and feeling different from other women of similar age. CONCLUSIONS: Young women consider that their healthrelated QoL is worse compared with older women. Young women worry about their future, with particular reference to their role as mothers and especially to children-bearing. The free screening and non-exclusion of young women is particularly important for breast cancer prevention and women's well-being.",1
"INTRODUCTION: The psychiatric consequences of induced abortion continue to be the object of controversy. The reactions of women when they became aware of conception are very variable. Pregnancy, whether initially intended or unintended, may provoke stress; and miscarriage may bring about feelings of loss  and grief reaction. Therefore, induced abortion, with its emotional implications  (of relief, shame and guilt) not surprisingly is a stressful adverse life event.  METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS: There is agreement among researchers on the need to compare the mental health outcomes (or the psychiatric complications) with appropriate groups, including women with unintended pregnancies ending in live births and women with miscarriages. There is also agreement on the need to control for the potential confounding effects of multiple variables: demographic, contextual, personal development, previous or current traumatic experiences, and  mental health prior to the obstetric event. Any psychiatric outcome is multi-factorial in origin and the impact of life events depend on how they are perceived, the psychological defence mechanisms (unconscious to a great extent) and the coping style. The fact of voluntarily aborting has an undeniable ethical  dimension in which facts and values are interwoven. RESULT: No research study has found that induced abortion is associated with a better mental health outcome, although the results of some studies are interpreted as <<neutral>> or <<mixed.>> Some general population studies point out significant associations with alcohol or illegal drug dependence, mood disorders (including depression) and some anxiety disorders. Some of these associations have been confirmed, and nuanced, by longitudinal prospective studies which support causal relationships. CONCLUSION: With the available data, it is advisable to devote efforts to the mental health care of women who have had an induced abortion. Reasons of the woman's mental health by no means can be invoked, on empirical bases, for inducing an abortion.",0
"BACKGROUND: Although public concern has focused on the environmental impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the public health impact on a broad range of coastal communities is minimally known. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the acute level of distress (depression, anxiety), mechanisms of adjustment (coping, resilience), and perceived risk in a community indirectly impacted by the oil spill and to identify the extent to which economic loss may explain these factors. METHODS: Using a community-based participatory model, we performed standardized assessments of psychological distress (mood, anxiety), coping, resilience, neurocognition, and perceived risk on residents of fishing communities who were indirectly impacted (n = 71, Franklin County, Florida) or directly exposed (n = 23, Baldwin County, Alabama) to coastal oil. We also compared findings for participants who reported income stability (n = 47) versus spill-related income loss (n = 47). RESULTS: We found no significant differences between community groups in terms of psychological distress, adjustment, neurocognition, or environmental worry. Residents of both communities displayed clinically significant depression and anxiety. Relative to those with stable incomes, participants with spill-related income loss had significantly worse scores on tension/anxiety, depression, fatigue, confusion, and total mood disturbance scales; had higher rates of depression; were less resilient; and were more likely to use behavioral disengagement as a coping strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Current estimates of human health impacts associated with the oil spill may underestimate the psychological impact in Gulf Coast communities that did not experience direct exposure to oil. Income loss after the spill may have a greater psychological health impact than the presence of oil on the immediately adjacent shoreline.",1
"""Eat a variety of foods,"" or dietary diversity, is a widely accepted recommendation to promote a healthy, nutritionally adequate diet and to reduce the risk of major chronic diseases. However, recent evidence from observational studies suggests that greater dietary diversity is associated with suboptimal eating patterns, that is, higher intakes of processed foods, refined grains, and  sugar-sweetened beverages and lower intakes of minimally processed foods, such as fish, fruits, and vegetables, and may be associated with weight gain and obesity  in adult populations. This American Heart Association science advisory summarizes definitions for dietary diversity and reviews current evidence on its relationship with obesity outcomes, eating behavior, and food-based diet quality  measures. Current data do not support greater dietary diversity as an effective strategy to promote healthy eating patterns and healthy body weight. Given the current state of the science on dietary diversity and the insufficient data to inform recommendations on specific aspects of dietary diversity that may be beneficial or detrimental to healthy weight, it is appropriate to promote a healthy eating pattern that emphasizes adequate intake of plant foods, protein sources, low-fat dairy products, vegetable oils, and nuts and limits consumption  of sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red meats.",0
"BACKGROUND: Although Complicated Grief (CG) has been associated with comorbid Panic Disorder (PD), little is known about panic attacks in CG, and whether panic symptoms may be grief-related. The present study examines the presence and impact of grief-related panic symptoms in CG. METHODS: Individuals with CG (n=146, 78% women, mean (SD) age=52.4(15.0)) were assessed for CG, DSM-IV diagnoses, work and social impairment, and with the Panic Disorder Severity Scale modified to assess symptoms ""related to or triggered by reminders of your loss"" and anticipatory worry. RESULTS: Overall, 39.7% reported at least one full or limited-symptom grief-related panic attack over the past week, and 32.2% reported some level of anticipatory worry about grief-related panic. Of interest, 17% met DSM criteria for PD. Among those without PD, 34.7% reported at least one full or limited-symptom grief-related panic attack over the past week, and this was associated with higher CG symptom severity (t=-2.23, p<0.05), and functional impairment (t=-3.31, p<0.01). Among the full sample, controlling for CG symptom severity and current PD, the presence of at least one full or limited-symptom grief-related panic attack was independently associated with increased functional impairment (B(SE)=4.86(1.7), p<0.01). LIMITATIONS: Limitations include a lack of assessment of non-grief-related panic symptoms and examination of a sample of individuals seeking treatment for CG. CONCLUSIONS: Grief-related panic symptoms may be prevalent among individuals with CG and independently contribute to distress and functional impairment.",1
"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify the best form of cognitive therapy among 3 main  cognitive interventions of Alzheimer's disease (AD) including cognitive training  (CT), cognitive stimulation (CS), and cognitive rehabilitation (CR). DESIGN: Systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: An exhaustive literature search was conducted based on  PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, the Chinese Biomedical Literature database, the Wan Fang database, and Web of Science and other database and randomized controlled trials were identified from their inception to May 1, 2018. Older adult participants diagnosed with AD were recruited. MEASURES: We conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) to rank the included treatments. Cognitive functions were measured based on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). A series of analyses and assessments, such as the Pairwise meta-analysis and the risk of bias, were performed concurrently. RESULTS: Only 22 studies were included in our analysis based on a series of rigorous screenings, which comprised 1368 participants. No obvious heterogeneities were found in NMA (I2 = 32.7%, P = .07) after the data were pooled. The mean difference (MD) of CT [MD = 2.1, confidence interval [CI]: 1.0,  3.2), CS (MD = 0.92, CI: -0.20, 2.0), and CR (MD = 2.0, CI: 0.73, 3.4) showed that CT and CR could significantly improve cognitive function as measured by MMSE in the treatment group whereas the CS was less effective. CT had the highest probability among the 3 cognitive interventions [the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) = 84.7%], followed by CR (SUCRA = 50.0%) and CS (SUCRA = 47.4%). CONCLUSIONS/RELEVANCE: Our study indicated that the CT might be the best method for improving the cognitive function of AD patients. The findings from our study  may be useful for policy makers and service commissioners when they make choices  among different alternatives.",0
"Four studies examined social relatedness and positive affect (PA) as alternate sources of information for judgments of meaning in life (MIL). In Studies 1 through 3 (total N = 282), priming loneliness increased reliance on PA and decreased reliance on social functioning in MIL judgments. In Study 4 (N = 138),  daily assessments of PA, relatedness needs satisfaction (RNS), and MIL were obtained every 5 days over 20 days. Multilevel modeling showed that on days when  RNS was low, PA was strongly related to MIL. Results suggest the dynamic ways that social relationships and PA inform judgments of MIL. Informational and motivational accounts of these results are discussed.",0
"While grief, emotional distress and other mental health conditions have been associated with pregnancy loss, less is known about the mental health impact of these events during subsequent pregnancies and births. This paper examined the impact of any type of pregnancy loss on mental health in a subsequent pregnancy and postpartum. Data were obtained from a sub-sample (N = 584) of the 1973-78 cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health, a prospective cohort study that has been collecting data since 1996. Pregnancy loss was defined as miscarriage, termination due to medical reasons, ectopic pregnancy and stillbirth. Mental health outcomes included depression, anxiety, stress or distress, sadness or low mood, excessive worry, lack of enjoyment, and feelings of guilt. Demographic factors and mental health history were controlled for in the analysis. Women with a previous pregnancy loss were more likely to experience sadness or low mood (AOR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.11 to 2.76, p = 0.0162), and excessive worry (AOR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.24 to 3.24, p = 0.0043) during a subsequent pregnancy, but not during the postpartum phase following a subsequent birth. These results indicate that while women who have experienced a pregnancy loss are a more vulnerable population during a subsequent pregnancy, these deficits are not evident in the postpartum.",1
"Food and eating are often associated with ambivalent feelings: pleasure and enjoyment, but also worry and guilt. Guilt has the potential to motivate behaviour change, but may also lead to feelings of helplessness and loss of control. This study firstly examined whether a default association of either 'guilt' or 'celebration' with a prototypical forbidden food item (chocolate cake) was related to differences in attitudes, perceived behavioural control, and intentions in relation to healthy eating, and secondly whether the default association was related to weight change over an 18month period (and short term weight-loss in a subsample of participants with a weight-loss goal). This study did not find any evidence for adaptive or motivational properties of guilt. Participants associating chocolate cake with guilt did not report more positive attitudes or stronger intentions to eat healthy than did those associating chocolate cake with celebration. Instead, they reported lower levels of perceived behavioural control over eating and were less successful at maintaining their weight over an 18month period. Participants with a weight-loss goal who associated chocolate cake with guilt were less successful at losing weight over a 3month period compared to those associating chocolate cake with celebration.",1
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Physiological arousal serves to maintain social anxiety disorder by skewing self-perception. Anxiety sensitivity is associated with the disorder and exaggerated perceptions of arousal, but has not been tested as explaining exaggerated perceived arousal in social contexts. The aim of this investigation was to address this issue. METHODS: A total of 42 individuals participated in three tasks associated with potential social threat (i.e., a speech, typing task, hyperventilation) and completed measures of trait social anxiety and anxiety sensitivity. State anxiety, perceived arousal, and objective arousal were assessed during each task. RESULTS: Trait social anxiety and anxiety sensitivity were correlated with state anxiety and perceived arousal, but not objective arousal, during the tasks. Anxiety sensitivity mediated the relationships between trait social anxiety and perceived arousal and between trait social anxiety and state anxiety for the typing and hyperventilation tasks. LIMITATIONS: Although the sample likely included a number of individuals with social anxiety disorder, the sample was mostly comprised of individuals without a diagnosis. The current results can be extended to clinical presentations to some extent, but future research is needed to further explore the demonstrated relationships in samples of individuals with social anxiety disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety sensitivity may play a crucial role in perceptions of arousal and state anxiety in the context of potential social threats, warranting attention from researchers and clinicians focussing on social anxiety disorder.",1
"Although cognitive theories of psychopathology suggest that attention bias toward threat plays a role in the etiology and maintenance of anxiety, there is relatively little evidence regarding individual differences in the earliest development of attention bias toward threat. The current study examines attention bias toward threat during its potential first emergence by evaluating the relations between attention bias and known risk factors of anxiety (i.e., temperamental negative affect and maternal anxiety). We measured attention bias to emotional faces in infants (N = 98; 57 male) ages 4 to 24 months during an attention disengagement eye-tracking paradigm. We hypothesized that (a) there would be an attentional bias toward threat in the full sample of infants, replicating previous studies; (b) attentional bias toward threat would be positively related to maternal anxiety; and (c) attention bias toward threat would be positively related to temperamental negative affect. Finally, (d) we explored the potential interaction between temperament and maternal anxiety in predicting attention bias toward threat. We found that attention bias to the affective faces did not change with age, and that bias was not related to temperament. However, attention bias to threat, but not attention bias to happy faces, was positively related to maternal anxiety, such that higher maternal anxiety predicted a larger attention bias for all infants. These findings provide support for attention bias as a putative early mechanism by which early markers of risk are associated with socioemotional development. (PsycINFO Database Record",1
"How does threat processing impact cognitive performance? To investigate this question, in the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study, participants performed a response-conflict task (neutral, congruent, and incongruent trials) that followed a variable-length shock anticipation period or a corresponding delay during which they would not be shocked. The delay period was cued by a geometric-shaped stimulus indicating whether the subject was in the safe (no shock) or threat (potential shock) condition. Behaviorally, participants showed increased reaction time interference (incongruent-neutral) during threat trials, an effect that increased as a function of state anxiety level across participants. Brain imaging data were analyzed for the cue and the subsequent target phase of the task. At the target phase, the left anterior insula exhibited interaction-type responses (i.e., increased interference during threat trials) that were positively associated with state anxiety level - a relationship that paralleled the behavioral pattern. At the cue phase, greater responses to threat vs. safe were observed in a circuit of regions, including the medial PFC, anterior insula, thalamus, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis/caudate, which we interpreted as engaged by shock monitoring/anticipation processes. In contrast, intriguingly, greater responses to safe vs. threat at the cue phase were observed in a broader set of regions that overlapped with the ""resting-state"" network. Finally, a standard statistical mediation analysis revealed that the relationship between state anxiety scores and interference-related responses in the left anterior insula during the target phase was partially mediated via cue responses in the medial PFC, consistent with the idea that more anxious individuals had difficulty in engaging the medial PFC during the threat condition. Taken together, our findings suggest that threat monitoring impairs the upcoming resolution of interference. Furthermore, a confluence of effects of cognitive task condition, threat, and individual differences in state anxiety was observed in the anterior insula, a structure that is suggested to be particularly important for the interaction between emotion and cognition.",1
"The affordability of wearable psychophysiological sensors has led to opportunities to measure the mental workload of operators in complex sociotechnical systems in ways that are more objective and less obtrusive. This study primarily focuses on the sensors themselves by investigating low-cost and wearable sensors in terms of their accuracy, obtrusiveness, and usability for research purposes. Two sensors were assessed on their accuracy as tools to measure mental workload through heart rate variability (HRV): the E3 from Empatica and the emWave Pro from HeartMath. The BioPatch from Zephyr Technology,  which is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved device, was used as a gold standard to compare the data obtained from the other 2 devices regarding their accuracy on HRV. Linear dependencies for 6 of 10 HRV parameters were found between the emWave and BioPatch data and for 1 of 10 for the E3 sensor. In terms  of research usability, both the E3 and the BioPatch had difficulty acquiring either sufficiently high data recording confidence values or normal distributions. However, the BioPatch output files do not require postprocessing,  which reduces costs and effort in the analysis stage. None of the sensors was perceived as obtrusive by the participants.",0
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Given that anxiety runs in families, it is critical to understand the cognitive factors that may be responsible for this intergenerational transmission. The present study offers a first step by exploring the link between mother and father tendencies to view potentially threatening situations as rapidly escalating toward dreaded outcomes (i.e., looming cognitive style) and the emotional disturbances and looming cognitive styles of their adult offspring. METHODS: We assessed cognitive vulnerabilities, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in a non-clinical sample (N = 382) of Italian college students and their parents. RESULTS: The looming cognitive style of fathers, but not mothers, was significantly related to greater anxiety in adult offspring. This finding was obtained for both sons and daughters, and remained even after statistically controlling for the anxiety, worry, depressive symptoms, and anxiety sensitivity (AS) of parents). Notably, the association between fathers' looming cognitive style and offspring symptoms was not related to their child's depressive symptoms, and similar to prior work, served as a cognitive marker specific to anxiety. LIMITATIONS: The present study relied on a cross-sectional design and did not use clients diagnosed with anxiety disorders. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that it may prove fruitful to consider parental vulnerabilities such as looming cognitive styles in comprehensive cognitive and interpersonal models of anxiety. The intergenerational transmission of emotional difficulties seems to extend beyond anxiety to beliefs about the escalation of threat.",1
"We studied the relationship between happiness and individual socio-demographic context and health and dietary variables by interviewing 389 elderly individuals  (age 60-90 years) living in rural areas in the Maule Region of Central Chile. The Lyubomirsky & Lepper (1999) subjective happiness scale was used. Ordinal logistic regression models were estimated. The discrete dependent variable was level of happiness. The following variables were significantly associated with happiness:  (1) individual socio-demographic variables like age and satisfaction with the economic situation; (2) health variables like independence in activities of daily living, common activities, and self-rated health; and (3) dietary variables such  as life satisfaction related to food and the frequency with which the elders shared dinner with others. The study results suggest more efficient efforts at healthy eating for the elderly in rural areas.",0
"There is growing evidence that heightened sensitivity to unpredictable threat is a core mechanism of dysfunction in anxiety disorders. However, it is unclear whether anxiety sensitivity is also associated with sensitivity to unpredictable threat. In the present study, 131 participants completed the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3, which includes physical concerns (PC), social concerns (SC), and cognitive concerns (CC) subscales, and a predictable vs. unpredictable threat-of-shock task. Startle eyeblink and ERP responses (N100, P300) to the acoustic startle probes were measured during the task. PC and CC were associated with heightened and attenuated, respectively, startle for the unpredictable (but not predictable) condition. CC were also associated with attenuated probe N100 for the unpredictable condition only, and PC were associated with increased P300 suppression across the predictable and unpredictable conditions. This study provides novel evidence that the different anxiety sensitivity dimensions demonstrate unique relationships with the RDoC domains ""acute"" and ""potential"" threat.",1
"Functionally, anxiety serves to increase vigilance towards aversive stimuli and improve the ability to detect and avoid danger. We have recently shown, for instance, that anxiety increases the ability to a) detect and b) instigate defensive responses towards aversive and not appetitive face stimuli in healthy individuals. This is arguably the key adaptive function of anxiety, yet the neural circuitry underlying this valence-specific effect is unknown. In the present translational study, we sought evidence for the proposition that dorsomedial regions of the prefrontal (DMPFC) and cingulate cortex constitute the human homologue of the rodent prelimbic and are thus associated with increased amygdala responding during this adaptive threat bias in anxiety. To this end, we applied a novel functional connectivity analysis to healthy subjects (N=20) identifying the emotion of fearful and happy faces in an fMRI scanner under anxious (threat of unpredictable foot shock) and non-anxious (safe) conditions. We showed that anxiety significantly increased positive DMPFC-amygdala connectivity during the processing of fearful faces. This effect was a) valence-specific (it was not seen for happy faces), b) paralleled by faster behavioral response to fearful faces, and c) correlated positively with trait anxiety. As such we provide the first experimental support for an anxiety-mediated, valence-specific, DMPFC-amygdala aversive amplification mechanism in healthy humans. This may be homologous to the rodent prelimbic-amygdala circuit and may, given the relationship with trait anxiety, underlie vulnerability to anxiety disorders. This study thus pinpoints a key neural mechanism in adaptive anxiety and highlights its potential link to maladaptive anxiety.",1
"The pattern of breathing, determined by time, volumetric and respiratory shape parameters was examined in male students subjected to mental arithmetic tasks, sustained attention tasks, a relaxation task and four levels of graded exercise.  Also, the relationships among the respiratory time parameters were determined by  performing a factor analysis on a pooled matrix containing the parameter correlations across all experimental conditions. Relative to baseline, the experimental tasks induced rather distinct breathing patterns. During exercise the breathing curves resembled a triangular shape which was caused by a decrease  in total breath duration coupled to an increase in both the depth of breathing and the inspiratory duty cycle time. For both the sustained attention and mental  arithmetic conditions there was a slight decrease in the depth of breathing and a more pronounced decrease in inspiration time. However, during mental arithmetic the decrease in inspiration was linked to an increase in expiration duration, exhibiting a breathing curve that resembled a 'saw tooth'. In contrast, the attention tasks induced a slight decrease in expiration duration showing a sinusoidal breathing curve which was more similar to the baseline and relaxation  breathing pattern. The factor analysis revealed two respiratory factors: a time factor reflecting inspiration, expiration and total cycle duration and a factor related to the inspiratory duty cycle time. We conclude that analysis of breathing patterns with components other than rate and depth of breathing is a potentially useful research tool.",0
"Cognitive biases are known to play an important role in anxiety. In this study we investigate whether maternal anxiety is associated with biases in interpretation, attention, and catastrophic processing about self-referent stimuli that may signal potential threat in the mother's own environment. We also investigate whether maternal anxiety is associated with biases about stimuli that their own child may encounter or to child-related stimuli more broadly. Three hundred mothers with a child aged 6 to 10 years participated. All participants completed a trait anxiety measure and an ambiguous sentences task to assess interpretation bias for self- and child-referent situations. A subset of the sample completed a catastrophizing interview about a self- (n = 194) or child-referent (n = 99) worry topic and an attentional dot-probe task (n = 99) with general threat and child threat stimuli. Maternal anxiety was not significantly associated with an attentional bias for general or child threat stimuli but was significantly associated with a bias for threat interpretations of both self and child-referent situations. Higher maternal anxiety was also significantly associated with generating more catastrophic outcomes to both a self-referent and child-referent hypothetical worry situation. We consider whether maternal cognitive biases, which extend to influence how mothers process potential threats in their child's world, may be an important mechanism through which intergenerational transmission of anxiety could occur.",1
"BACKGROUND: Mood and anxiety disorders are characterized by altered prefrontal-amygdala function and increased behavioral inhibition (BI) in response to potential threat. Whether these alterations constitute a vulnerability or a symptom of illness remains unclear. The medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) is thought to play a central role in estimating probability and cost of threat, in turn informing selection of subsequent behaviors. To better understand the behavioral and neural processes that may be associated with risk for psychopathology, we used a virtual reality paradigm to examine behavioral and neural responses of psychiatrically healthy adults with familial history of affective disorders during anticipation of unpredictable threat. METHODS: Twenty psychiatrically healthy adults with high familial risk for affective disorders and 20 low-risk matched controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging concurrent with a paradigm in which they explored virtual contexts associated with the threat of shock or safety from shock. Subjective anxiety ratings, skin conductance, exploratory behavior, and neural responses were examined for threat versus safe conditions. RESULTS: High-risk adults evidenced greater right mOFC activation, as well as greater BI, compared to low-risk adults. There were no significant group differences in subjective ratings or autonomic responses. Individuals exhibiting greater activity in the right mOFC showed greater BI and decreased skin conductance response. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that BI and mOFC recruitment during anticipation of aversive outcomes may reflect a vulnerability for affective disorders. However, such a response may also serve as a compensatory response, protecting these high-risk individuals from negative outcomes (i.e., increased physiological arousal). These results suggest that the OFC may play a central role in driving threat-related behaviors and thus may be a target for efforts aimed at early detection or prevention.",1
"This paper aimed to critically review and summarize empirical evidence concerning the efficacy of psychoeducation or relaxation-based stress management interventions on stress-related variables in people with mental disorders. Electronic databases were used during the literature search. Thirteen articles that fulfilled the preset eligible criteria were included in the review. Findings indicated that psychoeducation and relaxation-based interventions mitigated stress and depression; and enhanced relaxation intensity and knowledge on stress  management. However, mixed results were obtained on anxiety. In addition, interventions using virtual reality technology revealed positive effects on depression, relaxation intensity and anxiety. Limitations and recommendations for future research are discussed.",0
"This study investigated the changes in mental strategies across the season and their effects on performance and satisfaction with individual performance. Data were collected three times: at the pre-season at Time 1 (T1; baseline), in the mid-season at Time 2 (T2; two-month follow-up), and at the end-of-season at Time  3 (T3; nine-month follow-up) among male soccer players (N = 97) aged 16-27. Athletes completed the questionnaires assessing the use of nine psychological strategies in competition and the level of satisfaction with individual performance. Endurance performance was measured objectively with a 300 m run. A high level of relaxation (T1) explained better 300 m run performance (T3) and a high level of self-talk explained a higher satisfaction with individual performance (T3). A rare use of distractibility and emotional control (T1) predicted a higher level of satisfaction with individual performance (T3). No predictive role of other psychological strategies was found. The use of emotional control, relaxation, and distractibility increased over the season, whereas the use of imagery and negative thinking declined. Besides the roles of self-talk, imagery, relaxation and goal-setting, the effects of distractibility and emotional control should be taken into account when considering athletes' mental  training programs.",0
"BACKGROUND: Disaster recovery is a complex phenomenon. Too often, recovery is measured in singular fashion, such as quantifying rebuilt infrastructure or lifelines, without taking in to account the affected population's individual and  community recovery. A comprehensive framework is needed that encompasses a much broader and far-reaching construct with multiple underlying dimensions and numerous causal pathways; without the consideration of a comprehensive framework  that investigates relationships between these factors, an accurate measurement of recovery may not be valid. This study proposes a model that encapsulates these ideas into a single framework, the Socio-Ecological Model of Recovery. METHODS: Using confirmatory factor analysis, an operational measure of recovery was developed and validated using the five measures of housing stability, economic stability, physical health, mental health, and social role adaptation. The data were drawn from a sample of displaced households following Hurricane Katrina. Measures of psychological strength, risk, disaster exposure, neighborhood contextual effects, and formal and informal help were modeled to examine their direct and indirect effects on recovery using a structural equation model. FINDINGS: All five elements of the recovery measure were positively correlated with a latent measure of recovery, although mental health and social role adaptation displayed the strongest associations. An individual's psychological strength had the greatest association with positive recovery, followed by having  a household income greater than $20,000 and having informal social support. Those factors most strongly associated with an absence of recovery included the time displaced since the hurricane, being disabled, and living in a community with substantial social disorder. DISCUSSION: The socio-ecological framework provides a robust means for measuring  recovery, and for testing those factors associated with the presence or absence of recovery.",0
"Temporal phases of threat response, including potential threat (anxiety), acute threat (startle, fear), and post-threat response modulation, have been identified as the underlying markers of anxiety disorders. Objective measures of response during these phases may help identify children at risk for anxiety; however, the complexity of current assessment techniques prevent their adoption in many research and clinical contexts. We propose an alternative technology, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), that enables noninvasive measurement of the movements associated with threat response, and test its ability to detect threat response phases in young children at a heightened risk for developing anxiety. We quantified the motion of 18 children (3-7 years old) during an anxiety-/fear-provoking behavioral task using an IMU. Specifically, measurements from a single IMU secured to the child's waist were used to extract root-mean-square acceleration and angular velocity in the horizontal and vertical directions, and tilt and yaw range of motion during each threat response phase. IMU measurements detected expected differences in child motion by threat phase. Additionally, potential threat motion was positively correlated to familial anxiety risk, startle range of motion was positively correlated with child internalizing symptoms, and response modulation motion was negatively correlated to familial anxiety risk. Results suggest differential theory-driven threat response phases and support previous literature connecting maternal child risk to anxiety with behavioral measures using more feasible objective methods. This is the first study demonstrating the utility of an IMU for characterizing the motion of young children to mark the phases of threat response modulation. The technique provides a novel and objective measure of threat response for mental health researchers.",1
"Social play behaviour is a vigorous, highly rewarding social activity abundant in the young of most mammalian species, including humans. Social play is thought to  be important for social, emotional and cognitive development, yet its neural underpinnings are incompletely understood. We have previously shown that low doses of methylphenidate suppress social play behaviour through a noradrenergic mechanism of action, and that methylphenidate exerts its effect within the prefrontal cortex, amygdala and habenula. In the present study, we sought to reveal whether these regions work in parallel or in series to mediate the play-suppressant effect of methylphenidate. To that aim, we tested whether infusion of the α2-adrenoceptor antagonist RX821002 into the anterior cingulate cortex, infralimbic cortex, basolateral amygdala or habenula prevents the effect  of methylphenidate on social play behaviour, or the psychomotor stimulant effect  of methylphenidate. We found that the social play-suppressant effect of methylphenidate was not prevented by infusion of the α2-adrenoceptor antagonist into either region, or by infusion of RX821002 into both the anterior cingulate and infralimbic cortex. By contrast, RX821002 infusion into the anterior cingulate modestly enhanced social play, and infusion of the antagonist into the  infralimbic cortex attenuated the psychomotor stimulant effect of methylphenidate. We conclude that there is redundancy in the neural circuitry that mediates the play-suppressant effect of methylphenidate, whereby prefrontal  cortical and subcortical limbic mechanisms act in parallel. Moreover, our data support the notion that prefrontal noradrenergic mechanisms contribute to the locomotor enhancing effect of psychostimulant drugs.",0
"Research has indicated that individuals of Asian descent, relative to other racial groups, demonstrate reduced emotional responding and lower prevalence rates of several anxiety disorders. It is unclear though whether these group differences extend to biomarkers of anxiety disorders and whether genetic differences play a role. This study compared self-identified Caucasian, Latino, and Asian persons (total N = 174) on startle response during a baseline period and while anticipating unpredictable threat-a putative biomarker for certain anxiety disorders--as well as predictable threat. In addition, the association between genetic ancestry and startle response was examined within each racial group to determine potential genetic influences on responding. For the baseline period, Asian participants exhibited a smaller startle response relative to Caucasian and Latino participants, who did not differ. Within each racial group, genetic ancestry was associated with baseline startle. Furthermore, genetic ancestry mediated racial group differences in baseline startle. For the threat conditions, a Race x Condition interaction indicated that Asian participants exhibited reduced startle potentiation to unpredictable, but not predicable, threat relative to Caucasian and Latino participants, who did not differ. However, genetic ancestry was not associated with threat-potentiated startle in any racial group. This study adds to the growing literature on racial differences in emotional responding and provides preliminary evidence suggesting that genetic ancestry may play an important role. Moreover, reduced sensitivity to unpredictable threat may reflect a mechanism for why individuals of Asian descent are at less risk for particular anxiety disorders relative to other racial groups.",1
"ABSTRACTObjectives:Modifiable factors associated with increased risk of cognitive decline include emotional (anxiety, depression), cognitive (low social and mental stimulation), and health factors (smoking, alcohol use, sedentary lifestyle, obesity). Older adults with anxiety and depression may be at heightened risk due  to direct and indirect impacts of emotional distress on cognitive decline.DESIGN: Randomized controlled trialSetting:Community sample attending a university clinic. PARTICIPANTS: 27 participants (female = 20) aged over 65 years (M = 72.56, SD = 6.74) with an anxiety and/or mood disorder. INTERVENTIONS: two cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions (face-to-face or low intensity) that targeted emotional, health, and cognitive risks for cognitive decline. MEASUREMENTS: Participants completed diagnostic interviews; self-report measures  of anxiety, depression, quality of life, and lifestyle factors at baseline; post-treatment; and 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Both interventions resulted in significant and sustained improvements in depression, anxiety, quality of life, and physical and social activity. At post-treatment, face-to-face CBT demonstrated significantly greater improvements  in emotional symptoms, alcohol use, and memory (exercise approached significance). At 3-month follow-up, gains were maintained and there were significantly greater increases in mental activity for face-to-face CBT, with social activity approaching significance. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of CBT interventions to reduce emotional as well as lifestyle risk factors associated with cognitive decline in at-risk older participants. Large studies are needed to evaluate the long-term impact on cognitive decline. The trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (Trial Registration No. ACTRN12618000939291).",0
"Despite the established evidence for threat-related attention bias in anxiety, the mechanisms underlying this bias remain unclear. One important unresolved question is whether disorder-congruent threats capture attention to a greater extent than do more general or disorder-incongruent threat stimuli. Evidence for attention bias specificity in anxiety would implicate involvement of previous learning and memory processes in threat-related attention bias, whereas lack of content specificity would point to perturbations in more generic attention processes. Enhanced clarity of mechanism could have clinical implications for the stimuli types used in Attention Bias Modification Treatments (ABMT). Content specificity of threat-related attention bias in anxiety and potential moderators of this effect were investigated. A systematic search identified 37 samples from 29 articles (N=866). Relevant data were extracted based on specific coding rules, and Cohen's d effect size was used to estimate bias specificity effects. The results indicate greater attention bias toward disorder-congruent relative to disorder-incongruent threat stimuli (d=0.28, p<0.0001). This effect was not moderated by age, type of anxiety disorder, visual attention tasks, or type of disorder-incongruent stimuli. No evidence of publication bias was observed. Implications for threat bias in anxiety and ABMT are discussed.",1
"BACKGROUND: Emotional stress can either precipitate or exacerbate both acute and  chronic asthma. There is a large body of literature available on the use of relaxation techniques for the treatment of asthma symptoms. The aim of this systematic review was to determine if there is any evidence for or against the clinical efficacy of such interventions. METHODS: Four independent literature searches were performed on Medline, Cochrane Library, CISCOM, and Embase. Only randomised clinical trials (RCTs) were included. There were no restrictions on the language of publication. The data from trials that statistically compared the treatment group with that of the control were extracted in a standardised predefined manner and assessed critically by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: Fifteen trials were identified, of which nine compared the treatment group with the control group appropriately. Five RCTs tested progressive muscle relaxation or mental and muscular relaxation, two of which showed significant effects of therapy. One RCT investigating hypnotherapy, one of autogenic training, and two of biofeedback techniques revealed no therapeutic effects. Overall, the methodological quality of the studies was poor. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of evidence for the efficacy of relaxation therapies in the management of asthma. This deficiency is due to the poor methodology of the studies as well as the inherent problems of conducting such trials. There is  some evidence that muscular relaxation improves lung function of patients with asthma but no evidence for any other relaxation technique.",0
"It has been argued that culture significantly influences the developmental basis  of self-concept. The goal of the present study is to compare the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors to explain individual differences in various dimensions of self-concept in female preadolescents of Minnesota in the United States and Seoul in South Korea. Two hundred and eighteen monozygotic  (MZ) and 137 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs from the Minnesota Twin Family Study (MTFS) and 74 MZ and 42 DZ twin pairs from the Seoul Twin Family Study (STFS) completed the 6 cluster scales of the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale  (P-H). The 6 cluster scales of the P-H include Popularity, Physical Appearance and Attributes, Behavior, Intellectual Competence and School Status, Anxiety, and Happiness and Satisfaction. Univariate model-fitting analyses were performed. In  both samples, a model incorporating shared and nonshared environmental influences fitted the data best for Popularity, Anxiety, and Intellectual Competence and School Status, whereas a model including additive genetic and nonshared environmental factors provided the best fit for Physical Appearance and Attributes, and Behavior. The univariate model did not yield an adequate fit for  Happiness and Satisfaction. For Physical Appearance and Attributes, and Intellectual Competence and School Status, estimates of additive genetic and environmental factors were significantly different between the MTFS and the STFS  samples. For Popularity, Anxiety, and Behavior, however, the genetic and environmental estimates were comparable between the two samples.",0
"Loss of pleasure (clinically referred to as anhedonia), impairments in other reward-related processes such as reward learning, motivation, and reward valuation, and blunted affect characterize several mood and other psychiatric disorders. Despite the availability of many therapeutic options for these disorders, reward-related impairments remain challenging to treat and often persist despite alleviation of other symptoms. Lack of animal models of reward-related impairments and affect that have high construct and predictive validity is a key obstacle to developing novel treatments. This review highlights 1) guidelines to consider when developing translatable animal models; and 2) recent efforts to develop new reward-related assessments in humans and nonhuman animals that have been translated or back-translated from one species to another. The procedures described in this review are used to assess aspects of reward learning, motivated behavior, reward valuation, and affect. In several cases, researchers have attempted to implement task parameters that are as identical as  possible to the parallel parameters used in existing cross-species tasks, with the goal of improving the translation of preclinical drug discovery findings to the clinic. In this regard, Dr. Athina Markou, who worked tirelessly throughout her career to understand and treat reward-related impairments across several psychiatric disorders, had great influence on conceptualizing the development and use of translational animal models of reward-related processes.",0
"Given the personal and societal costs associated with acute impairment and enduring post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the mental health response to disasters is an integral component of disaster response planning. The purpose of  this paper is to explore the compatibility between cognitive-behavioral psychology and the disaster mental health model, and explicate how cognitive-behavioral perspectives and intervention methods can enhance the effectiveness of disaster mental health services. It is argued that cognitive-behavioral methods, if matched to the contexts of the disaster and the  needs of individuals, will improve efforts to prevent the development of PTSD and other trauma-related problems in survivors of disaster or terrorist events. First, the similarities between models of care underlying both disaster mental health services and cognitive-behavioral therapies are described. Second, examples of prior cognitive-behavioral therapy-informed work with persons exposed to disaster and terrorism are provided, potential cognitive-behavioral therapy applications to disaster and terrorism are explored, and implications of cognitive-behavioral therapy for common challenges in disaster mental health is discussed. Finally, steps that can be taken to integrate cognitive-behavioral therapy into disaster mental health are outlined. The aim is to prompt disaster mental health agencies and workers to consider using cognitive-behavioral therapy to improve services and training, and to motivate cognitive-behavioral researchers and practitioners to develop and support disaster mental health response.",0
"BACKGROUND: This pilot study was designed to investigate the efficacy of a cognitive behavioral treatment for anger. METHOD: Twelve (5 men and 7 women) outpatient adults completed 2-hour group sessions for 16 sessions. Participants were diagnosed with 29 Axis I and 34 Axis  II disorders with high rates of comorbidity. Empirically supported techniques of  skills training, cognitive restructuring, and relaxation were utilized. In this protocol, cognitive restructuring emphasized the use of the ABC model to understand anger episodes and the Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) techniques of disputing irrational beliefs and rehearsing rational coping statements, but additional cognitive techniques were used, e.g. self-instructional training (SIT). Skills training included problem-solving and assertiveness. Relaxation training was paced respiration. Motivational interviewing, imaginal exposure with coping, and relapse prevention were also included. RESULTS: Significant improvements were found from pre- to post-treatment on the following measures: the Trait Anger Scale of the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-II; and Anger Disorder Scale total scores; idiosyncratic anger measurements of situational intensity and symptom severity; and the Beck Depression Inventory-II. CONCLUSIONS: In order to extend the significant research findings of this pilot study, future investigations should involve larger sample sizes, populations drawn from various settings, and contact control groups.",0
"Developing a better understanding of how and under what circumstances alcohol affects the emotions, cognitions and neural functions that precede and contribute to dangerous behaviors during intoxication may help to reduce their occurrence. Alcohol intoxication has recently been shown to reduce defensive reactivity and anxiety more during uncertain vs certain threat. However, alcohol's effects on emotionally motivated attention to these threats are unknown. Alcohol may disrupt both affective response to and attentional processing of uncertain threats making intoxicated individuals less able to avoid dangerous and costly behaviors. To test this possibility, we examined the effects of a broad range of blood alcohol concentrations on 96 participants' sub-cortically mediated defensive reactivity (startle potentiation), retrospective subjective anxiety (self-report) and cortically assessed emotionally motivated attention (probe P3 event related potential) while they experienced visually cued uncertain and certain location electric shock threat. As predicted, alcohol decreased defensive reactivity and subjective anxiety more during uncertain vs certain threat. In a novel finding, alcohol dampened emotionally motivated attention during uncertain but not certain threat. This effect appeared independent of alcohol's effects on defensive reactivity and subjective anxiety. These results suggest that alcohol intoxication dampens processing of uncertain threats while leaving processing of certain threats intact.",1
"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to systematically review the literature to evaluate the impact of systemic sclerosis (SSc) on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) assessed by the Medical Outcomes Short-Form-36 questionnaire (SF-36). METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, Web of Science and Embase until April 2017 to obtain eligible studies. Random effect model was performed to summarize the scores of each domain. Scores from the SF-36 questionnaire were used as the outcome measurements, and mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: In total, seven studies were eligible for inclusion criteria, comprising 795 SSc patients and 1154 healthy controls. The SF-36 questionnaire score of each domain (physical function, role physical function, emotional role function, vitality, mental health, social function, body pain, general health) was lower in SSc patients than in healthy controls, meanwhile, physical component scale (PCS)  and mental component scale (MCS) scores were all lower in patients with SSc than  in healthy controls. Likewise, pooled mean scores of PCS and MCS ranged from 31.20 to 52.80, 37.40 to 68.30, respectively. Additionally, the score of PCS was  lower than that of MCS in SSc patients. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed that SSc patients had lower HRQoL than healthy controls, and SSc had negative influence on the HRQoL of patients. This indicates that clinical workers should pay more attention to SSc patients' HRQoL, so as to improve global health of patients with SSc.",0
"Emotion regulation has important consequences for emotional and mental health (Saxena, Dubey & Pandey, 2011) and is dependent on executive function (Eisenberg, Smith & Spinrad, 2011). Because state anxiety disrupts executive function (Robinson, Vytal, Cornwell & Grillon, 2013), we tested whether state anxiety disrupts emotion regulation by having participants complete an instructed emotion regulation task, while under threat of unpredictable shock and while safe from shock. We used the late positive potential (LPP) component of the event related potential to measure emotion regulation success. We predicted that LPP responses to negatively valenced images would be modulated by participants' attempts to increase and decrease their emotions when safe from shock, but not while under threat of shock. Our manipulation check revealed an order effect such that for participants who completed the threat of shock condition first self-reported state anxiety carried over into the subsequent safe condition. Additionally, we found that although instructions to regulate affected participants' ratings of how unpleasant the images made them feel, instructions to regulate had no effect on LPP amplitude regardless of threat condition. Instead we found that participants who received the threat condition prior to safe had greater LPP responses to all images in the safe condition. We posit that the carryover of anxiety resulted in misattribution of arousal and potentiation of neural responses to the images in the safe condition. Thus, our results imply that physiological arousal and cognition combine to influence the basic neural response to emotional stimuli. (PsycINFO Database Record",1
"In the course of conducting a controlled comparison of progressive muscle relaxation and thermal biofeedback as possible substitutes for second-stage (sympatholytic) antihypertensive medications, we measured reactivity (heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure) to three different stressors (mental arithmetic, cold pressor, and negative mental imagery) before and after treatment and drug withdrawal. Neither treatment was consistently effective in reducing reactivity across a variety of stressors. Relaxation led to more reductions in some aspect of reactivity than did biofeedback. The modest level of reductions in reactivity were seen more for mental arithmetic and systolic blood pressure.",0
"Analysis of threat is thought to involve a ""quick and dirty"" stage in conjunction with slower processing that is more complete. We investigated both types of threat analysis by recording brain potentials in response to threat and neutral words. Personality testing was used to identify participants who were either high or low in trait anxiety (TA). An observed enhancement of occipital P1 potentials to threat words during an emotional Stroop task was interpreted as a signal of unconscious processing, since it was early, independent of whether word exposure was subliminal or supraliminal, and more prominent the higher the level of TA. Later positive potentials were also enhanced for threat versus neutral words, but the amplitude enhancement increased with higher TA only in the subliminal condition. These results suggest that unconscious analysis of threat is intensified in those prone to anxiety, as is a later stage of threat processing subject to dynamic interactions between automatic and strategic influences.",1
"The vantage perspective from which memories are recalled influences their emotional impact. To date, however, the impact of vantage perspective on the emotions elicited by positive memories and images of positive future events has been minimally explored. We experimentally manipulated the vantage perspective from which a sample of undergraduate students (n =80) recalled positive memories  and imagined positive future events. Participants who naturally recalled their positive memories from a field perspective reported decreased vividness and positive affect (i.e., happiness, optimism, hopefulness) when they were instructed to shift to an observer perspective. The same pattern of emotionality  ratings was observed when participants' vantage perspective of imagined future events was manipulated. In contrast, shifting participants from observer to field perspective recall of positive memories did not result in changes in ratings of memory-related emotion, although we found an unexpected trend towards reduced vividness. For positive future events, shifting from an observer to a field perspective resulted in decreased vividness but did not lead to any changes in positive emotion. Our findings confirm that vantage perspective plays a key role  in determining the emotional impact of positive memories, and demonstrate that this relationship is also evident for images of future positive events.",0
"PURPOSE: The current study aimed to characterize grocery shopping and dinner preparation behaviours among young people in Canada and to examine associations with eating habits. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted with 2008 participants aged 16-24 from across Canada. The survey measured self-reported grocery shopping and dinner preparation behaviours, frequency of eating breakfast and eating meals prepared away from home, frequency of vegetable and fruit intake, and socio-demographic characteristics. Chi-square tests examined differences in proportions; logistic and linear regressions examined dietary habits, including covariates for grocery shopping and dinner preparation and socio-demographics. RESULTS: Overall, 37.3% had helped with grocery shopping in the past week, and 84.3% had participated in dinner preparation at least 1 day in the past week. Engaging in shopping at least once weekly was associated with increased vegetable and fruit consumption only, whereas more frequent engagement in dinner preparation was associated with increased vegetable and fruit consumption, more frequent breakfast consumption, and fewer meals consumed that were prepared away  from home (P < 0.001 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Increased participation in grocery shopping and dinner preparation were associated with healthier dietary habits. Interventions that increase these  behaviours may contribute to improving dietary behaviours among adolescents and young adults.",0
"Group-based Transdiagnostic Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TCBT) for anxiety disorders aims to target common factors to produce beneficial effects on multiple anxiety disorders at once. While there is growing evidence that various anxiety disorders can be effectively treated by this approach, the common factors contributing to these treatment effects are not well delineated. In a sample of 48 Veterans who completed Group-based TCBT, the current study examined change in threat perception and change in experiential avoidance pre to post-treatment and as potential mediators of changes in negative affect and personalized fear ratings. Results indicated that both threat perception and experiential avoidance were significantly reduced during treatment. Additionally, reductions in both threat perception and experiential avoidance significantly predicted reductions in negative affect and fear ratings. When change in threat perception and change in experiential avoidance were examined simultaneously, both remained significant predictors of changes in negative affect though only experiential avoidance predicted changes in fear ratings. Thus, both reductions in threat perception and experiential avoidance may mediate the broad treatment effects observed in group-based TCBT. Directions for future research are discussed.",1
"Purpose Biological age (BA) has recently emerged as a substitute for chronological age (CA), and many subjects seek to optimally control their BA. However, in South Korea, no study has adequately explored factors that affect BA, although individual health management is essential to preventing chronic diseases. In the present study, we focus on the use of health information, in particular nutrition facts, to control BA. Methods We used data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (2010⁻2015; 26,914 eligible participants) using BA and age differences as outcome variables. We used multiple linear regression to explore the relationship between the use of nutrition data and differences in BA after adjusting for covariates. In addition, we used multiple linear regression to examine subgroup differences in such relationships. Results 12.8% of males and 27.5% of females used nutrition facts when deciding which foods to purchase. The more attention paid to such facts, the lower the BA  and BA differences in both males and females (males: β = -2.646, females: β = -2.787, p < 0.05, for BA; males: β = -1.181, females, β = -2.161, p < 0.05, for BA differences). However, BA differences were more significant in subjects with chronic disease, obesity, and/or a family history of chronic disease. Conclusion  High-level awareness of and active use of nutrition facts permitted effective self-management in preventing chronic disease and improving BA, particularly in subjects at higher risk for chronic disease. Thus, considering nutrition facts when deciding what to purchase is important.",0
"Attentional interference control is a prominent feature of human cognition. To what extent sexual stimuli attract attention and interfere with cognitive tasks has still little been studied. Our study aimed to identify associations between attentional interference, sexual arousal, trait sexual motivation, and neural activity to sexual distractors while accounting for gender differences. Therefore, the present study examined the neural correlates of attentional interference by arousing sexual distractors using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Fifty women and 47 men underwent fMRI while indicating the orientation of two lines (equal or unequal) next to an explicit sexual (as compared to a neutral) picture. Results confirmed prolonged response times when a sexual image was shown. There was neither a difference between genders nor an effect of sexual arousal ratings or trait sexual motivation on distractibility. Neural activity specific to sexual images was found in brain regions implicated in motivation and reward processing. Men as compared to women showed stronger responses in the nucleus caudatus, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the nucleus accumbens. Trait sexual motivation was selectively correlated with nucleus caudatus activity. Taken together, findings support the notion that even when not in the focus, sexual images activate the brains' reward circuitry. Men's higher sensitivity to the rewarding value of sexual cues may be critical for their higher risk of addictive/compulsive sexual behaviors.",0
"BACKGROUND: Pediatric patients attended to by emergency medical services (EMS) but not transported to the hospital are an at-risk population. We aimed to evaluate risk factors associated with nontransport by EMS in pediatric patients. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of 24 agencies in a regional EMS system in Southwestern Pennsylvania between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2017. We abstracted demographics (age, sex, medical complaint, median household income by  zip code, race, ethnicity), clinical characteristics (abnormal vital signs by age, procedures done), and transport characteristics. We excluded patients ≥ 18 years, interfacility transfers, scene assists, cardiac arrest, and those without  a patient encounter. We used unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression to identify factors associated with nontransport, reporting adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: We included 30,663 pediatric patients (52.9% male, mean ± SD age = 8.5 ± 6.2 years), of whom 5,002 (16.3%) were nontransports. In adjusted analysis  (aOR, 95% CI), nontransports were associated with medical categories of trauma (4.32, 3.57-5.23), respiratory (4.03, 3.09-5.26), toxicologic (2.53, 1.66-3.86),  and syncope (5.97, 3.78-9.41). Nontransports were less likely for psychiatric (0.52, 0.34-0.79) complaints; for black patients compared to white (0.31, 0.26-0.37); and in patients 6 to <12 years (0.76, 0.65-0.90), 2 to <6 years (0.77, 0.65-0.91), 1 to <2 years (0.53, 0.42-0.66), and 1 month to 1 year (0.52,  0.40-0.66) compared to patients ≥ 12 years of age. Nontransport was associated with longer scene time (1.03, 1.02-1.04) and with fall compared to winter (1.29,  1.08-1.54) and was less likely in those with abnormal mental status (0.45, 0.33-0.62), medication administration (0.16, 0.08-0.31), or monitor application (0.10, 0.06-0.15). CONCLUSION: Pediatric nontransports are associated with traumatic, respiratory, and toxicologic complaints and older age. These findings can facilitate development of refusal protocols and research on outcomes of these at-risk patients.",0
"H1N1 reached pandemic proportions in 2009, yet considerable ambivalence was apparent concerning the threat presented and the inclination to be vaccinated. The present investigation assessed several factors, notably appraisals of the threat, intolerance of uncertainty, and familiarity with the virus, that might contribute to reactions to a potential future viral threat. Canadian adults (N = 316) provided with several scenarios regarding viral threats reported moderate feelings of anxiety, irrespective of whether the viral threat was one that was familiar versus one that was entirely unfamiliar to them (H1N1 recurrence, H5N1, a fictitious virus: D3N4). Participants appraised the stressfulness of the threats to be moderate and believed that they would have control in this situation. However, among individuals with high intolerance of uncertainty, the viral threat was accompanied by high levels of anxiety, which was mediated by aspects of appraisals, particularly control and stressfulness. In addition, among those individuals that generally appraised ambiguous life events as being stressful, the viral threat appraisals were accompanied by still greater anxiety. Given the limited response to potential viral threats, these results raise concerns that the public may be hesitant to heed recommendations should another pandemic occur.",1
"Late-stage attentional processing of threatening stimuli, quantified through event-related potentials (ERPs), differentiates youth with and without anxiety disorders. It is unknown whether early-stage attentional processing of threatening stimuli differentiates these groups. Examining both early and late stage attentional processes in youth may advance knowledge and enhance efforts to identify biomarkers for translational prevention and treatment research. Twenty-one youth with primary DSM-IV-TR anxiety disorders (10 males, ages 8-15 years) and 21 typically developing Controls (15 males, ages 8-16 years) completed a dot probe task while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded, and ERPs were examined. Youth with anxiety disorders showed significantly larger (more positive) P1 amplitudes for threatening stimuli than for neutral stimuli, and Controls showed the opposite pattern. Youth with anxiety showed larger (more negative) N170 amplitudes compared with Controls. Controls showed significantly larger (more positive) P2 and P3 amplitudes, regardless of stimuli valence, compared with youth with anxiety disorders. ERPs observed during the dot probe task indicate youth with anxiety disorders display distinct neural processing during early stage attentional orienting and processing of faces; this was not the case for Controls. Such results suggest these ERP components may have potential as biomarkers of anxiety disorders in youth.",1
"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) represents a cluster of conditions that have a negative impact on human health overall. Its prevalence has been rapidly increasing worldwide and has coincided with a global decrease in birth rates and fertility potential. This review aims to address this observation through studying the relationship between MetS and male reproductive health. The effects of obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance on male fertility were examined and supporting evidence explaining the pathophysiology of sperm dysfunction with each MetS component were described. Adopting a healthy lifestyle appears to be the single most important intervention to prevent the unwanted effects of MetS on men's health and fertility. Further studies addressing the components of MetS and their impact on male reproduction are required to enhance  our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and to propose new methods for therapeutic intervention.",0
"BACKGROUND: The antihypertensive drug losartan has been shown to improve memory in humans as well as learning and fear extinction in rodent models, highlighting its potential to have similar synergistic effects on exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders. This study investigated the effect of losartan on neural correlates of processing threat versus safety stimuli in highly anxious individuals to identify potential pathways of how the drug might facilitate psychological treatment. METHODS: Thirty healthy volunteers high in trait anxiety were randomly assigned to a single dose of losartan (50 mg) versus placebo before undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. We measured brain response to happy and fearful faces presented for 80 seconds to assess emotional processing and habituation over time. RESULTS: The placebo group showed similarly high left amygdala activation early on during presentation of fearful and happy faces, which decreased over time. In contrast, losartan reduced amygdala response to happy faces early on. In response to fearful faces, the drug prevented habituation, caused sustained amygdala activation, and led to increased activation in other brain areas associated with threat processing, such as the insula and putamen. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest two distinct effects of losartan on emotional processing, including an improvement of early discrimination of stimuli as threatening versus safe, and facilitation of threat processing. Both processes are known to be relevant for successful exposure, highlighting two potential pathways by which losartan might exert facilitative effects on psychological treatment.",1
"Previous studies revealed that both self-concept and social support were associated with mental health in college students. Very few studies have explored the ways these two variables work on mental health, particularly in mainland China. In the present study, 411 college students in northwest China were assessed using the School and Society Situations Scale (which includes a social support sub-scale and self-concept sub-scale) and Self-report Symptom Checklist 90. The results showed that a positive self-concept was positively correlated with individual perceived social support from parents, teachers, and peers, and that both self-concept and perceived social support were negatively associated with mental health problems. Moreover, structural equation modeling analyses showed that self-concept fully mediated the role of perceived social support in individuals' mental health. These results suggested that all kinds of perceived support from the social environment may help the college student form a positive  self-concept, and the positive self-concept may help them resist and effectively  cope with the risk factors related to mental health. These results also have implications in interventions to improve mental health in college students.",0
"Cognitive models posit that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is associated with and maintained by biased attention allocation vis-a-vis social threat. However, over the last decade, there has been intense debate regarding whether AB in SAD results from preferential engagement with or difficulty in disengaging from social threat. Further, recent evidence suggests that AB may merely result from top-down attentional impairments vis-a-vis non-emotional material. Consequently, uncertainty still abounds regarding both the relative importance and the mutual interactions of these different processes and SAD symptoms. Inspired by novel network approaches to psychopathology that conceptualize symptoms as complex dynamic systems of mutually interacting variables, we computed weighted directed networks to investigate potential causal relations among laboratory measures of attentional components and symptoms of social anxiety disorder. Global and local connectivity of network structures revealed that the three most central variables were the orienting component of attention as well as both avoidance and fear of social situations. Neither preferential attention engagement with threat nor difficulty disengaging from threat exhibited high relative importance as predictors of symptoms in the network. Together, these findings suggest the value of extending the network approach beyond self-reported clinical symptoms to incorporate process-level measures from laboratory tasks to gain new insight into the mechanisms of SAD.",1
"In their adaptive control hypothesis, Cavanagh and Shackman (2015) recently claimed that dispositional anxiety is correlated with frontal-midline theta (FMtheta) as a generic ""need for control"" signal of the anterior midcingulate cortex. Here, we tested this assumption, also considering potential modulatory influences of anticipatory threat and individuals' sex. In a nonclinical sample of 168 participants (84 women), electroencephalogram was recorded while individuals performed a simple two-choice task. Half of the participants were assigned to a threat anticipation condition (anticipation of public speaking), whereas the other half was assigned to a control condition. State anxiety was monitored across the experiment. Dispositional anxiety was assessed by self-report scales, which were completed before individuals came to the laboratory. Target stimuli in the two-choice task induced a transient increase in FMtheta power that was subject to an interaction of dispositional anxiety, sex, and experimental group. Only in women who anticipated public speaking did we observe a substantial positive relation between dispositional anxiety and general FMtheta power. Our results indicate that the link between dispositional anxiety and FMtheta is not universal but rather depends on complex interactions of individuals' sex and situational threat.",1
"On a three years base experience in the geriatric department of Geneva's university psychiatric clinic, the paper studies among practical problems encountered in the application in institutional geriatry of relaxation, those related to therapists' training and to the nature of therapy control established  for them and their patients. Problems pertaining to the management of the cure according to the method of J. de Ajuriaguerra amd M. Cahen are viewed, and the position of relaxation in the post-graduate psychiatric training defined. The study also mentions the influence of relaxation applied to the aged patient on his human environment in and out of the hospital. These notes are complementary to those already presented on the indications of relaxation in geriatry, the way  body is preceived by the aged patient through relaxation, and it's consequences on the adjustment of an aging person.",0
"The purpose of this paper was: first, to develop the short six-item form of the Depression-Happiness Scale; and second, to examine evidence of reliability and validity for the short form. Three studies are presented. In the first study, principal components analysis is reported and used to select six items to compose the short form of the scale. In the second study, re-analyses of data from three  previous studies are presented which confirm that the short scale has good psychometric properties of internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, and convergent and discriminant validity. In the third study, the short form is found to have a single component structure and convergent validity  with measures of depression, happiness and personality.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Longitudinal data on cardiometabolic effects of egg intake during adolescence are lacking. The current analyses aim to evaluate the impact of usual adolescent egg consumption on lipid levels, fasting glucose, and insulin resistance during late adolescence (age 17-20 years). METHODS: Data from 1392 girls, aged 9 to 10 at baseline and followed for 10 years, in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's National Growth and  Health Study were used to examine the association between usual egg intake alone  and in combination with other healthy lifestyle factors and late adolescent lipid levels, fasting glucose, and insulin resistance, measured as homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Diet was assessed using 3-day food records during eight examination cycles. Girls were classified according to usual weekly egg intake, ages 9-17 years: <1 egg/wk (n = 361), 1 to <3 eggs/wk (n = 703), and ≥3 eggs/wk (n = 328). Analysis of covariance modeling was used to  control for confounding by other behavioral and biological risk factors. RESULTS: Girls with low, moderate, and high egg intakes had adjusted low-density  lipoprotein cholesterol levels of 99.7, 98.8, and 95.5 mg/dL, respectively (p = 0.0778). In combination with higher intakes of fiber, dairy, or fruits and vegetables, these beneficial effects were stronger and statistically significant. There was no evidence that ≥3 eggs/wk had an adverse effect on lipids, glucose, or HOMA-IR. More active girls who consumed ≥3 eggs/wk had the lowest levels of insulin resistance. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that eggs may be included as part of a healthy  adolescent diet without adverse effects on glucose, lipid levels, or insulin resistance.",0
"BACKGROUND: The difficulty in treating mood disorders has brought about clinical interest in alternative treatments, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). However, the optimal parameters for stimulation and underlying mechanisms of action are unclear. Psychiatric treatments have acute effects on emotional processing that predict later therapeutic action. Such effects have been proposed as cognitive biomarkers for screening novel treatments for depression and anxiety. METHODS: This study assessed the effect of tDCS on a battery of emotional processing measures sensitive to antidepressant action. To refine optimal stimulation parameters, DLPFC stimulation using two common electrode montages was compared with sham. Sixty healthy volunteers received 20 minutes of active or sham DLPFC stimulation before completing computerized emotional processing tasks, including a dot-probe measure of vigilance to threat. RESULTS: Relative to sham stimulation, participants receiving simultaneous anodal stimulation of left DLPFC and cathodal stimulation of right DLPFC (bipolar-balanced montage) showed reduced vigilance to threatening stimuli. There was no such significant effect when the cathode was placed on the supraorbital ridge (bipolar-unbalanced montage). There were no effects of tDCS on other measures of emotional processing. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide the first experimental evidence that modulating activity in the DLPFC reduces vigilance to threatening stimuli. This significant reduction in fear vigilance is similar to that seen with anxiolytic treatments in the same cognitive paradigm. The finding that DLPFC tDCS acutely alters the processing of threatening information suggests a potential cognitive mechanism that could underwrite treatment effects in clinical populations.",1
"A new approach for efficiently exploring the configuration space and computing the free energy of large atomic and molecular systems is proposed, motivated by an analogy with reinforcement learning. There are two major components in this new approach. Like metadynamics, it allows for an efficient exploration of the configuration space by adding an adaptively computed biasing potential to the original dynamics. Like deep reinforcement learning, this biasing potential is trained on the fly using deep neural networks, with data collected judiciously from the exploration and an uncertainty indicator from the neural network model playing the role of the reward function. Parameterization using neural networks makes it feasible to handle cases with a large set of collective variables. This  has the potential advantage that selecting precisely the right set of collective  variables has now become less critical for capturing the structural transformations of the system. The method is illustrated by studying the full-atom explicit solvent models of alanine dipeptide and tripeptide, as well as the system of a polyalanine-10 molecule with 20 collective variables.",0
"Theoretical frameworks of anxiety propose that attentional biases to threat-related stimuli cause or maintain anxious states. The current paper draws on theoretical frameworks and key empirical studies to outline the distinctive attentional processes highlighted as being important in understanding anxiety. We develop a conceptual framework to make a distinction between two attentional biases: selective attention to threat and hypervigilance for threat. We suggest that these biases each have a different purpose and can account for the typical patterns of facilitated and impaired attention evident in anxious individuals. The framework is novel in its specification of the eye movement behavior associated with these attentional biases. We highlight that selective attention involves narrowing overt attention onto threat to ensure that these stimuli receive processing priority, leading to rapid engagement with task-relevant threat and delayed disengagement from task-irrelevant threat. We show that hypervigilance operates in the presence and absence of threat and involves monitoring for potential dangers via attentional broadening or excessive scanning of the environment with numerous eye movements, leading to improved threat detection and increased distraction from task-irrelevant threat. We conclude that future research could usefully employ eye movement measures to more clearly understand the diverse roles of attention in anxiety.",1
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate Hurricane Katrina's impact on patients with pre-existing chronic pain. Design. Review of literature about Hurricane Katrina and chronic pain or pain management and a qualitative interview of all identified patients enrolled in a behavioral pain management program. SETTING: Southeast Louisiana Veterans Healthcare System, Mental Health Service Line. SUBJECTS: In total, 42 of the 53 (79%) veterans enrolled in a chronic pain program prior to Hurricane Katrina were able to be contacted and evaluated with interviews and a review of their available medical records. OUTCOME MEASURES: Major impediments and facilitative factors in delivering pain management services were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Health care planning for large-scale emergencies must take into the  need for prompt continuation of pain management services in patients with chronic pre-existing pain. Coordination between emergency clinics and pain management specialists, as well as the availability of electronic medical records, is an important factor in continuing established pain management services after a regional disaster.",0
"Biased emotion processing in depression might be a trait characteristic independent of mood improvement and a vulnerable factor to develop further depressive episodes. This phenomenon of among older adults with depression has not been adequately examined. In a 2-year cross-sectional study, 59 older patients with either active or remitted major depression, or never-depressed, completed a facial emotion recognition task (FERT) to probe perceptual bias of happiness. The results showed that depressed patients, compared with never depressed subjects, had a significant lower sensitivity to identify happiness particularly at moderate intensity of facial stimuli. Patients in remission from  a previous major depressive episode but with none or minimal symptoms had similar sensitivity rate to identify happy facial expressions as compared to patients with an active depressive episode. Further studies would be necessary to confirm  whether recognition of happy expression reflects a persistent perceptual bias of  major depression in older adults.",0
"CONTEXT: The quality of death has increasingly raised concern because of the physical and psychological suffering of patients with advanced disease. Music therapy has been widely used in palliative care; however, its physical and mental effectiveness remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of music therapy during palliative care in improving physiology and psychology outcomes. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials evaluating music therapy for terminally ill patients were searched and included from inception up to April 25, 2018. The quality of the studies was assessed using the risk of bias tool recommended by the Cochrane Handbook V.5.1.0. RESULTS: In this study, 11 randomized controlled trials (inter-rater agreement, κ = 0.86) involving 969 participants were included. The quality of the included studies ranged from moderate to high. Compared with general palliative care, music therapy can reduce pain (standardized mean difference: -0.44, 95% confidence interval: -0.60 to -0.27, P < 0.00001) and improve the quality of life (standardized mean difference: 0.61, 95% confidence interval: 0.41 to 0.82, P < 0.00001) in terminally ill patients. In addition, anxiety, depression, and emotional function are improved as well. However, no significant differences were found in the patient's physical status, fatigue, and social function. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis study demonstrated that music therapy served as an effective intervention to alleviate pain and psychological symptoms of terminally ill patients. However, considering the limitation of the quantity of the studies  included, these results would need to be further confirmed.",0
"Interactions between the processing of emotion expression and form-based information from faces (facial identity) were investigated using the redundant-target paradigm, in which we specifically tested whether identity and emotional expression are integrated in a superadditive manner (Miller, Cognitive  Psychology 14:247-279, 1982). In Experiments 1 and 2, participants performed emotion and face identity judgments on faces with sad or angry emotional expressions. Responses to redundant targets were faster than responses to either  single target when a universal emotion was conveyed, and performance violated the predictions from a model assuming independent processing of emotion and face identity. Experiment 4 showed that these effects were not modulated by varying interstimulus and nontarget contingencies, and Experiment 5 demonstrated that the redundancy gains were eliminated when faces were inverted. Taken together, these  results suggest that the identification of emotion and facial identity interact in face processing.",0
"Implementation issues often interfere with delivery of evidence-based interventions for students exposed to trauma. To improve uptake of evidence-based techniques for such students, a partnership of interventionist scientists, research and development experts, and students created a self-paced, confidential, online curriculum. This article describes the program and results of an open trial in 5 schools that serve primarily ethnic minority youth in urban settings. Fifty-one middle and high school students completed surveys before and  after the program, as well as within the program, to assess emotional and behavioral symptoms (depressive, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] symptoms and behavior) and purported mechanisms of action (coping, cognitions, emotional self-efficacy). Results indicated the program was feasible and acceptable, with moderate satisfaction. Despite low power in this study, we observed changes in several hypothesized mechanisms of action. In addition, we observed promising improvements in PTSD symptoms, emotional problems, and total behavioral difficulties. These findings offer the promise of using a self-help web-based tool to augment and enhance usual school support services. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).",0
"Research evidence has suggested that anxiety influences gait in PD, with an identified dopa-sensitive gait response in highly anxious PD. It has been well-established that accurate perception of the environment and sensory feedback is essential for gait. Arguably since sensory and perceptual deficits have been noted in PD, anxiety has the potential to exacerbate movement impairments, since one might expect that reducing resources needed to overcome or compensate for sensory-perceptual deficits may lead to even more severe gait impairments. It is possible that anxiety in threatening situations might consume more processing resources, limiting the ability to process information about the environment or one's own movement (sensory feedback) especially in highly anxious PD. Therefore, the current study aimed to (i) evaluate whether processing of threat-related aspects of the environment was influenced by anxiety, (ii) evaluate whether anxiety influences the ability to utilize sensory feedback in PD while walking in threatening situations, and (iii) further understand the role of dopaminergic medication on these processes in threatening situations in PD. Forty-eight participants (24 HC; 12 Low Anxious [LA-PD], 12 Highly Anxious [HA-PD]) completed 20 walking trials in virtual reality across a plank that was (i) located on the ground (GROUND) (ii) located above a deep pit (ELEVATED); while provided with or without visual feedback about their lower limbs (+VF; -VF). After walking across the plank, participants were asked to judge the width of the plank they had just walked across. The plank varied in size from 60-100 cm. Both ON and OFF dopaminergic medication states were evaluated in PD. Gait parameters, judgment error and self-reported anxiety levels were measured. Results showed that HA-PD reported greater levels of anxiety overall (p<0.001) compared to HC and LA-PD, and all participants reported greater anxiety during the ELEVATED condition compared to GROUND (p=0.01). PD had similar judgment error as HC. Additionally, medication state did not significantly influence judgment error in PD. More importantly, HA-PD were the only group that did not adjust their step width when feedback was provided during the GROUND condition. However, medication facilitated a reduction in ST-CV when visual feedback was available only in the HA-PD group. Therefore, the current study provides evidence that anxiety may interfere with information processing, especially utilizing sensory feedback while walking. Dopaminergic medication appears to improve utilization of sensory feedback in stressful situations by reducing anxiety and/or improving resource allocation especially in those with PD who are highly anxious.",1
"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that the unaffected siblings of patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience deficits in attention, impulsivity control, and behavior inhibition, which are associated  with health-risk behaviors. However, risks to mental and physical health among the unaffected siblings of ADHD probands have rarely been investigated. METHODS: Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, 5128 unaffected siblings of ADHD probands born between 1980 and 2000 were included in  our study along with 20,512 age- and sex-matched controls, and they were followed from 1996 or birth until the end of 2011. Mental and physical health risks, including affective disorders, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and sexually transmitted infection were identified during the follow-up period. RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses with adjustments for demographic data showed that the unaffected siblings were more likely to develop unipolar depression (odds ratio [OR]: 1.76, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.39-2.22), bipolar disorder (OR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1. 09-4.05), and TBI (OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.14-1.36) than were the control group. DISCUSSION: The unaffected siblings of patients with ADHD were prone to developing unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, and TBI later in life.",0
"Amygdala reactivity to threat-related distractor stimuli can be abolished in perceptually demanding contexts. Premised on the biological imperative to respond swiftly to threat, we demonstrate, however, that when participants are threatened by shock, greater amygdala responses to fearful compared to neutral distractor faces is preserved under conditions of high attentional demand. Lateral prefrontal cortices also showed selective responding to fearful distractor faces under these conditions, suggesting that threat-related distractor stimuli engaged attentional control mechanisms. We conclude that anxiety elicited by looming threat promotes neurocognitive processes that broaden attention and enhance sensitivity to potential danger cues, even when perceptual systems are taxed.",1
"Palliative medicine deals with patients in the final phase of their life. These terminally ill patients should receive a treatment which focuses on the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial and spiritual. The treatment should focus on the improvement of the Quality of Life (QoL) instead of straining curative treatment approaches. It should also deal with the needs of the families. In palliative medicine an interdisciplinary approach is inevitable and imperative. Although an oral care provider should be a member of the palliative care team this is not always the case in palliative care settings. The prevention of infections, treatment of xerostomia, mucositis and candidiasis as well as the removal of sore spots are some of the important aspects of palliative oral treatment. They can have an immediate positive impact  on the patients OHRQoL and their comfort in general. The particular dental work profile requires a practitioner with empathy and professional experience.",0
"BACKGROUND: Whether physical activity can reduce cognitive frailty-a relatively new ""compound"" phenotype proposed in 2013-and whether the effect of physical activity differs based on levels of inflammation are unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of physical activity on cognitive frailty and  whether baseline interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels modified this effect. METHODS: We used data from the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) Study, a multicenter, single-blinded randomized trial conducted at  eight US field centers between February 2010 and December 2013. The main outcome  was cognitive frailty at 24 months, expressed as an ordinal variable based on the six combinations of its two components: frailty (non-frail, pre-frail, and frail) and mild cognitive impairment (yes, no). Frailty and cognition were assessed by the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) index and the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE) scale, respectively. Plasma IL-6 was measured at baseline. Of the 1635 original randomized sedentary participants (70-89 years), this study included 1298 participants with data on both cognitive frailty and IL-6 assessments at baseline. RESULTS: After adjusting for field center, sex, and baseline levels of cognitive  frailty, the ordinal logistic regression model revealed that participants in the  physical activity group had 21% lower odds (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.98) of worsening cognitive frailty over 24 months than those in  the health education group. The effect of physical activity on cognitive frailty  did not differ according to baseline IL-6 levels (P for interaction = 0.919). The results did not change after additional adjustment for IL-6 subgroups and the inverse probability of remaining in the study. Comparable results were observed according to age, sex, ethnicity/race, and short physical performance battery score (P for interaction = 0.835, 0.536, 0.934, and 0.458, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A 24-month structured, moderate-intensity physical activity program  reduced cognitive frailty compared with a health education program in sedentary older persons, and this beneficial effect did not differ according to baseline levels of inflammatory biomarker IL-6. These findings suggest that the new cognitive frailty construct is modifiable and highlight the potential of targeting cognitive frailty for promoting healthy aging.

"Researchers have only recently begun using functional neuroimaging to explore the human response to periods of sustained anxious anticipation, namely potential threat. Here, we investigated brain responses acquired with functional MRI during an instructed threat of shock paradigm used to create sustained periods of aversive anticipation. In this re-analysis of previously published data, we employed quadratic discriminant analysis to classify the multivariate pattern of whole-brain functional connectivity and to identify connectivity changes during periods of potential threat. Our method identifies clusters with altered connectivity on a voxelwise basis, thus eschewing the need to define regions a priori. Classifier generalization was evaluated by testing on data from participants not used during training. Robust classification between threat and safe contexts was possible, and inspection of ""diagnostic features"" revealed altered functional connectivity involving the intraparietal sulcus, task-negative regions, striatum, and anterior cingulate cortex. We anticipate that the proposed method will prove useful to experimenters wishing to identify large-scale functional networks that distinguish between experimental conditions or groups.",1
"Recent indications are suggesting that high fat and sugar-enriched foods do not only evoke harmful physiological conditions, but they also endure evident structural alterations in cerebral regions controlling cognitive and feeding behaviors. Food consumption plus neuronal energy regulatory mechanisms seem to constitute a complex system assuring that food calories do not exceed body requirements. At the same time obesogenic-related properties of limbic feeding stations like the hypothalamus (HTH), hippocampus (HIP) and amygdala (AMY) tend to control eating habits through the interaction of distinct neuropeptides. For this purpose, it was our intention to correlate expression differences of a key anti-obesogenic neuropeptide receptor i.e. neurotensin1 (NTR1) on mnemonic performances in the hibernating hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) exposed to a high  fat diet (HFD). Interestingly, these hamsters exhibited a notable enhanced (p < 0.01) body weight from the fifth on to the twelfth week of treatment, which  was accompanied by elevated blood lipid cholesterolo and triglycerides and glucose levels. At the same time these hamsters provided diminished locomotor activities such as exploratory bouts, rearing and grooming behaviors. Of greater  relevance was their very extreme (p < 0.001) inability of identifying new objects during novel object recognition (NOR) tests along with not having correctly chosen the chamber of the conditioned place preference (CPP) apparatus, which contained the gratifying reward. Surprisingly the altered behavioral plus mnemonic tasks of HFD hamsters were tightly related to elevated NTR1 expression changes in the above limbic sites thus proposing this neuronal system as a highly probable alternative for treating obesity-dependent mnemonic dysfunctions.",0
"Gluten elimination may represent an effective treatment strategy for mood disorders in individuals with gluten-related disorders. However, the directionality of the relationship remains unclear. We performed a systematic review of prospective studies for effects of gluten on mood symptoms in patients  with or without gluten-related disorders. Six electronic databases (CINAHL, PsycINFO, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane Library) were searched, from inception to 8 August 2018, for prospective studies published in English. Meta-analyses with random-effects were performed. Three randomised-controlled trials and 10 longitudinal studies comprising 1139 participants fit the inclusion criteria. A gluten-free diet (GFD) significantly improved pooled depressive symptom scores in GFD-treated patients (Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) -0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.55 to -0.20; p < 0.0001), with no difference in mean scores between patients and healthy controls after one year (SMD 0.01, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.20, p = 0.94). There was a tendency towards worsening symptoms for  non-coeliac gluten sensitive patients during a blinded gluten challenge vs. placebo (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.15; p = 0.25). Our review supports the association between mood disorders and gluten intake in susceptible individuals.  The effects of a GFD on mood in subjects without gluten-related disorders should  be considered in future research.",0
"BACKGROUND: Lifestyle changes and the adoption of healthy behaviours are well established recommendations for the management of hypertension-a risk factor for  cardiovascular and kidney disease. Mobile health interventions offer unique advantages and novel approaches to helping individuals make and maintain such behaviour changes; however, current interventions often lack theoretical and scientific grounding. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to effectively model the knowledge, concepts and relationships relevant to the management of a chronic illness like hypertension, and to implement this knowledge model within a mobile self-management application that can be used by patients. METHODS: A behaviour modification approach based on COM-B (capability, opportunity, motivation, behaviour) Model and the associated Behaviour Change Wheel was developed. An ontology-based knowledge model was implemented to formally conceptualise relevant knowledge in hypertension clinical practice guidelines, behaviour change models and associated behaviour change strategies. A hypertension management decision support framework was designed and implemented as a proof-of-concept mobile phone application (EmpowerBP) using the aforementioned model. The usability of this pilot application was tested using think-aloud protocol by eight individuals with hypertension while performing predefined tasks. Thematic analysis with inductive thematic coding was performed  to identify specific feedback and areas for improvement. RESULTS: The most common positive feedback included participants finding application resources interesting or helpful and liking the user interface. The most common negative feedback was finding the included salt calculator confusing  or laborious to use and finding the profile creation questionnaire too long. The  derived themes were: features, profile creation, resources, scenario, usability,  user interface. CONCLUSIONS: The ontology knowledge model formalises variables, properties, and relationships such that they can be used for problem solving. By integrating and  computerising complex knowledge from clinical practice guidelines, behaviour change theories, and associated behaviour change strategies, it is possible to model existing information about the management of hypertension as an ontology. This proof-of-concept application creates clinical and behavioural profiles of a  user to provide them with personalised management strategies, rooted in established behaviour change theory, that will engage and empower them to manage  their condition. Given the nature of ontological models, this approach can be easily modified to address a variety of chronic illnesses.",0
"The capacity to adjust actions based on new information is a vital cognitive function. An animal's ability to adapt behavioral responses according to changes  in reward value can be measured using a reinforcer devaluation task, wherein the  desirability of a given object is reduced by decreasing the value of the associated food reinforcement. Elements of the neural circuits serving this ability have been studied in both rodents and nonhuman primates. Specifically, the basolateral amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and mediodorsal thalamus have each been shown to play a critical role in the process  of value updating, required for adaptive goal selection. As these regions receive dense cholinergic input, we investigated whether systemic injections of non-selective nicotinic or muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists, mecamylamine and scopolamine, respectively, would impair performance on a reinforcer devaluation task. Here we demonstrate that in the presence of either a nicotinic or muscarinic antagonist, animals are able to shift their behavioral responses in an appropriate manner, suggesting that disruption of cholinergic neuromodulation is not sufficient to disrupt value updating, and subsequent goal  selection, in rhesus macaques.",0
"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Interventions aimed at lifestyle changes are pivotal for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and web-based programs might help remove barriers in both patients and therapists. METHODS: In the period 2010-15, 716 consecutive NAFLD cases (mean age, 52; type 2 diabetes, 33%) were treated in our Department with structured programs. The usual protocol included motivational interviewing and a group-based intervention (GBI), chaired by physicians, dietitians and psychologists (five weekly meetings, n = 438). Individuals who could not attend GBI entered a web-based intervention (WBI, n = 278) derived from GBI, with interactive games, learning tests, motivational tests, and mail contacts with the center. The primary outcome was weight loss ≥10%; secondary outcomes were alanine aminotransferase within normal  limits, changes in lifestyle, weight, alanine aminotransferase, and surrogate markers of steatosis and fibrosis. RESULTS: GBI and WBI cohorts had similar body mass index (mean, 33 kg/m2), with more males (67% vs. 45%), younger age, higher education, and more physical activity in the WBI group. The two-year attrition rate was higher in the WBI group. Healthy lifestyle changes were observed in both groups and body mass index decreased by almost two points;the 10% weight target was reached in 20% of WBI cases vs. 15% in GBI (not significant). In logistic regression analysis, after adjustment for confounders and attrition rates, WBI was not associated with a reduction of patients reaching short- and long-term 10% weight targets. Liver enzymes decreased in both groups, and normalized more frequently in WBI. Fatty liver index was reduced, whereas fibrosis remained stable (NAFLD fibrosis score)  or similarly decreased (Fib-4). CONCLUSION: WBI is not less effective than common lifestyle programs, as measured by significant clinical outcomes associated with improved histological outcomes in NAFLD. eHealth programs may effectively contribute to NAFLD control. LAY SUMMARY: In patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, participation in structured lifestyle programs may be jeopardized by job and time constraints. A web-based intervention may be better suited for young, busy patients, and for those living far from liver units. The study shows that, following a structured motivational approach, a web-based, interactive intervention coupled with six-month face-to-face meetings is not inferior to a standard group-based intervention with respect to weight loss, adherence to healthy diet and habitual  physical activity, normalization of liver enzymes, and stable surrogate markers of fibrosis.",0
"Introduction: The emergence of anxiety during childhood is accompanied by the development of attentional biases to threat. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these biases are poorly understood. In addition, previous research has not examined whether state and trait anxiety are independently associated with threat-related biases. Methods: We compared ERP waveforms during the processing of emotional faces in a population sample of 58 6-11-year-olds who completed self-reported measures of trait and state anxiety and depression. Results: The results showed that the P1 was larger to angry than neutral faces in the left hemisphere, though early components (P1, N170) were not strongly associated with child anxiety or depression. In contrast, Late Positive Potential (LPP) amplitudes to angry (vs. neutral) faces were significantly and positively associated with symptoms of anxiety/depression. In addition, the difference between LPPs for angry (vs. neutral) faces was independently associated with state and trait anxiety symptoms. Discussion: The results showed that neural responses to facial emotion in children with elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression were most evident at later processing stages characterized as evaluative and effortful. The findings support cognitive models of threat perception in anxiety and indicate that trait elements of anxiety and more transitory fluctuations in anxious affect are important in understanding individual variation in the neural response to threat in late childhood.",1
"The present research examined whether cognitive load modulates the neural processing of appetitive, high-calorie food stimuli. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, participants quickly categorized high-calorie and low-calorie food pictures versus object pictures as edible or inedible while they concurrently performed a digit-span task that varied between low and high cognitive load (memorizing six digits vs. one digit). In line with predictions, the digit-span task engaged the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) when cognitive load was high compared to low. Moreover, exposure to high-calorie compared to low-calorie food pictures led to increased activation in the nucleus  accumbens (NAcc), but only when cognitive load was low and not when it was high.  In addition, connectivity analyses showed that load altered the functional coupling between NAcc and right DLPFC during presentation of the high-calorie versus low-calorie food pictures. Together, these findings indicate that loading  the cognitive system moderates hedonic brain responses to high-calorie food pictures via interactions between NAcc and DLPFC. Our findings are consistent with the putative cognitive nature of food motivation. Implications for future research are discussed.",0
"BACKGROUND: In many countries, medical authorities are responsible for involuntary admissions of mentally ill patients. Nonetheless, very little is known about GPs' experiences with involuntary admission. AIM: The aim of the present study was to explore GP's experiences from participating in involuntary admissions. SETTING: General practice, Aarhus, Denmark. METHOD: One focus group interview and six individual interviews were conducted with 13 Danish GPs, who had recently sectioned one of their own patients. RESULTS: GPs experienced stress and found the admission procedure time consuming. They felt that sectioning patients was unpleasant, and felt nervous, but experienced relief and professional satisfaction if things went well. The GPs experienced the doctor-patient relationship to be at risk, but also reported that it could be improved. GPs felt that they were not taken seriously by the psychiatric system. CONCLUSION: The unpleasant experiences and induced feelings resulting from involuntary admissions reflect an undesirable and stressful working environment.",0
"According to ICD-10 International Statistical Classification of Diseases anxiety  state is different combination of somatic and mental symptoms of anxiety of absence of real menace that is onset attack-like or permanently. Anxious disorder is observed in 5-10% of the population, twice more often at woman than at men. The lengthening of the postinsult period is observed more often in the structure  of the patient with old cerebral infarction that is complicated with anxious disorder. Diagnostics, treatment and prevention of anxious disorder in the postinsult period require elaboration of new approaches by the doctors. It is announced that anxious disorder in the postinsult period at such patient may reach 60-70%. Researches have been held on the basis of the clinic ""Medina"" in Batumi. The main group consisted of 30 out-patients (14 women and 16 men) between 41 and 73 years old who experienced cerebral infarction of 3-18 months prescription. Patients with pancreatic diabetes and unstable accompanying somatic diseases were excluded. Computer or magnetic - resonant tomography of the brain was performed to all patients during insult in order to verify the diagnosis; the clinical-and-psychological and neurological check up was also performed using neurological scale NIH NINDS in order to identify severity of insult as well as using the scale ""Renkin"" to assess the degree of impairment of vital functions. Depression was assessed with the help of HDRS (Hamilton depression ration scale). The level and presence of anxiety were determined by the scale that assesses the  level of reactive and personal - anxiety. The following initial data were received as a result of research from the patients of the comparing groups before treatment: an average age of patients was 55,1+/-1,9 years; prescription of cerebral infarction was 6,35+/-1,0 months; severity of cerebral infarction on scale NIH NINDS was 2,7+/-0,25 points; invalidation degree on ""Renkin"" scale was  1,95+/-0,25 points. Personal anxiety was 85,4+/-7,27 points according to self assessment scale, reactive anxiety equaled 86,3+/-7,1 points. Depression evidence in comparing groups turned out to be initially high and equaled 14,5+/-2,1 points. The study revealed cognitive functions according to MMSE at 4 men. Therefore, a long effecting social stress leads to development of depression. Unemployed people working under constant pressure, living in overpopulated areas  are the most subject to stress as well as those whose mutual relation with associates are broken and who more often gets in disputed situations. The first condition in treatment of the anxious disorders is detailed knowledge of the patient and his understanding the essence of illness. The necessary information and the elementary receptions of treatment for overcoming anxiety and panic attacks are given by the doctor. Frequently, the relief comes only that the patient realizes that it not illness that is unknown and dangerous to a life, but curable anxious disorder. Whenever possible the doctor will advise a relevant method of psychotherapy which will help to cope with the problems caused by prolonged panic disorder.",0
"BACKGROUND: Anxious hypervigilance is marked by sensitized sensory-perceptual processes and attentional biases to potential danger cues in the environment. How this is realized at the neurocomputational level is unknown but could clarify the brain mechanisms disrupted in psychiatric conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder. Predictive coding, instantiated by dynamic causal models, provides a promising framework to ground these state-related changes in the dynamic interactions of reciprocally connected brain areas. METHODS: Anxiety states were elicited in healthy participants (n = 19) by exposure to the threat of unpredictable, aversive shocks while undergoing magnetoencephalography. An auditory oddball sequence was presented to measure cortical responses related to deviance detection, and dynamic causal models quantified deviance-related changes in effective connectivity. Participants were also administered alprazolam (double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover) to determine whether the cortical effects of threat-induced anxiety are reversed by acute anxiolytic treatment. RESULTS: Deviant tones elicited increased auditory cortical responses under threat. Bayesian analyses revealed that hypervigilant responding was best explained by increased postsynaptic gain in primary auditory cortex activity as well as modulation of feedforward, but not feedback, coupling within a temporofrontal cortical network. Increasing inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acidergic action with alprazolam reduced anxiety and restored feedback modulation within the network. CONCLUSIONS: Threat-induced anxiety produced unbalanced feedforward signaling in response to deviations in predicable sensory input. Amplifying ascending sensory prediction error signals may optimize stimulus detection in the face of impending threats. At the same time, diminished descending sensory prediction signals impede perceptual learning and may, therefore, underpin some of the deleterious effects of anxiety on higher-order cognition.",1
"Several pieces of evidence suggest that the noradrenergic afferents in the medial preoptic area produce sleep and hypothermia by acting on alphal adrenergic receptors. On the other hand, in a few studies monitoring body temperature with a rectal probe, preoptic injection of the alphal adrenergic agonist methoxamine produced contradictory changes in body temperature and sleep-wakefulness. Such contradictions call for the re-examination of methoxamine induced body temperature changes using a better technique like telemetric recording. In the present study, we monitored body temperature and sleep-wakefulness simultaneously after the micro-injection of 0.5, 1, and 2 micromol methoxamine, into the medial preoptic area of adult male Wistar rats. Methoxamine injection produced hypothermia but no major change in sleep-wakefulness during the 3 hours after drug injection, except for a short period (15 min) of sleep after 120 min of injection. A short period of wakefulness, coinciding with the maximum fall in body temperature (30 min after injection) occurred when methoxamine was administered at higher doses. The results of this study indicate that alphal adrenergic receptors participate in preoptically mediated thermoregulatory measures that reduce body temperature. Hypothermia induced by methoxamine might have masked the hypnogenic action of this drug.",1
"BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity, defined as two or more concurrent chronic diseases within the same individual, is becoming the clinical norm within primary care. Given the burden of multimorbidity on individuals, carers and health care systems, there is a need for effective self-management programmes. Promoting active participation within their clinical care and following a healthy lifestyle will help empower patients and target lifestyle factors that are exacerbating their conditions. The aim of this study is to establish whether a tailored, structured self-management programme can improve levels of physical activity at 12 months, in people with multimorbidity. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a single-centre randomised controlled trial, with follow-up at 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome is change in objectively assessed average daily physical activity at 12 months. Secondary outcomes include medication adherence, lifestyle behaviours, quality of life, chronic disease self-efficacy and self-efficacy for exercise. Anthropometric and clinical measurements include blood pressure, muscle strength, lipid profile, kidney function and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Participants are recruited from primary care. Those between 40 and 85 years of age with multimorbidity, with a good understanding of written and verbal English, who are able to give informed consent, have access to a mobile phone for use in study activities and are able to walk independently will be invited to participate. Multimorbidity is defined as two or more of the chronic conditions listed in the Quality and Outcomes Framework. A total of 338 participants will be randomly assigned, with stratification for gender and ethnicity, to either the control group, receiving usual care, or the intervention group, who are invited to the Movement through Active Personalised engagement programme. This involves attending four group-based self-management sessions aimed at increasing physical activity, mastering emotions, managing treatments and using effective communication. The sessions are delivered by trained facilitators, and regular text messages during  the study period provide ongoing support. Changes in primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed, and an economic evaluation of the intervention undertaken. DISCUSSION: This study will provide new evidence on whether physical activity can be promoted alongside other self-management strategies in a multimorbid population and whether this leads to improvements in clinical, biomedical, psychological and quality of life outcomes.

"Impulsive choice involves choosing a smaller-sooner (SS) reward over a larger-later (LL) reward. Due to the importance of timing processes in impulsive  choice, time-based interventions have been developed to decrease impulsive choice. The present set of experiments assessed the durability and generalizability of time-based interventions. Experiment 1 assessed fixed interval (FI) or variable interval (VI) intervention efficacy over 9 months. The  FI intervention decreased impulsive choice, and this effect persisted over time,  but the VI intervention effects were only apparent when tested immediately after  the intervention. Experiment 2 examined the generalizability of the FI and VI interventions on choice tasks manipulating the SS delay, LL delay, or LL magnitude. The FI intervention decreased sensitivity to delay, promoting LL choices in both delay tasks, but the VI intervention only altered choices when manipulating the SS delay. Experiment 3 further examined the FI intervention effects on tasks that manipulated the LL delay or magnitude immediately following the intervention. The intervention decreased sensitivity to both delay and magnitude. The experiments indicate that the FI intervention is effective at decreasing impulsive choice behavior for an extended period across changing delays and magnitudes, suggesting a relatively broad effect on choice behavior.",0
"The orexinergic neurons of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) are critical for wakefulness [McCarley RW (2007) Neurobiology of REM and NREM sleep. Sleep Med 8:302-330]. Recent evidence suggests that adenosine (AD), a homeostatic sleep factor, may act via A1 receptor (A1R) to control orexinergic activity and regulate sleep-wakefulness [Thakkar MM, Winston S, McCarley RW (2002) Orexin neurons of the hypothalamus express adenosine A1 receptors. Brain Res 944:190-194; Liu ZW, Gao XB (2006) Adenosine inhibits activity of hypocretin/orexin neurons via A1 receptor in the lateral hypothalamus: a possible sleep-promoting effect. J Neurophysiol]. To evaluate the role of AD in the orexinergic LH and its influences on sleep-wakefulness, we designed two experiments in freely behaving rats: First, we bilaterally microinjected 1,3-dipropyl-8-phenylxanthine (DPX) (1.5 pmol and 15 pmol), a selective A1R antagonist into the LH during the light cycle and examined its effect on spontaneous sleep-wakefulness. Second, we performed 6 h of sleep deprivation. Thirty minutes before the animals were allowed to enter recovery sleep, 15 pmol of DPX was bilaterally microinjected into the LH and its effects on recovery sleep were monitored. Microinjection of DPX into the orexinergic LH produced a significant increase in wakefulness with a concomitant reduction in sleep, both during spontaneous bouts of sleep-wakefulness and during recovery sleep. Local administration of DPX into the LH produced a significant increase in the latency to non-REM sleep during recovery sleep. However, total slow wave (delta) activity during non-REM sleep phase of recovery sleep remained unaffected after DPX treatment. This is the first study that implicates endogenous adenosine to have a functional role in controlling orexinergic tone and influencing the homeostatic regulation of sleep-wakefulness.",1
"BACKGROUND: The wide use of herbal plants and essential oils for the prevention and treatment of diseases dates back to ancient times. However, the scientific basis for the beneficial effects of such plants and oils has not been precisely clarified. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of aromatherapy  body treatment on healthy subjects. DESIGN: We compared the physiologic and psychologic effects of aromatherapy body  treatment (E), massage treatment with carrier oil alone (C), and rest in healthy  adults. SUBJECTS: Seven (7) female and 6 male volunteers participated as subjects. INTERVENTIONS: Each subject underwent 3 trials, in which the Advanced Trail Making Test (ATMT) was given as a stress-inducing task before and after 1 of 3 treatments. OUTCOME MEASURES: The State Anxiety Inventory (SAI), the Visual Analog Scale, and the Face Scale were used to assess anxiety, feelings, and mood, respectively. RESULTS: After the treatments, the SAI score and the feelings of fatigue were decreased, the positive and comfortable feelings were increased, and mood improved significantly in C and E. Furthermore, significant declines in the feelings of mental and total fatigue were maintained even after the second ATMT in E. On the other hand, the cortisol concentration in the saliva did not show significant changes in any of the trials. Secretory immunoglobulin A levels in the saliva increased significantly after all treatments. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that massage treatments, irrespective of the presence of essential oils, are more advantageous than rest in terms of psychologic or subjective evaluations but not in terms of physiologic or objective evaluations.  Furthermore, as compared to massage alone, the aromatherapy body treatment provides a stronger and continuous relief from fatigue, especially fatigue of mental origin.",0
"BACKGROUND: Whether physical activity can reduce cognitive frailty-a relatively new ""compound"" phenotype proposed in 2013-and whether the effect of physical activity differs based on levels of inflammation are unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of physical activity on cognitive frailty and  whether baseline interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels modified this effect. METHODS: We used data from the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) Study, a multicenter, single-blinded randomized trial conducted at  eight US field centers between February 2010 and December 2013. The main outcome  was cognitive frailty at 24 months, expressed as an ordinal variable based on the six combinations of its two components: frailty (non-frail, pre-frail, and frail) and mild cognitive impairment (yes, no). Frailty and cognition were assessed by the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) index and the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE) scale, respectively. Plasma IL-6 was measured at baseline. Of the 1635 original randomized sedentary participants (70-89 years), this study included 1298 participants with data on both cognitive frailty and IL-6 assessments at baseline. RESULTS: After adjusting for field center, sex, and baseline levels of cognitive  frailty, the ordinal logistic regression model revealed that participants in the  physical activity group had 21% lower odds (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.98) of worsening cognitive frailty over 24 months than those in  the health education group. The effect of physical activity on cognitive frailty  did not differ according to baseline IL-6 levels (P for interaction = 0.919). The results did not change after additional adjustment for IL-6 subgroups and the inverse probability of remaining in the study. Comparable results were observed according to age, sex, ethnicity/race, and short physical performance battery score (P for interaction = 0.835, 0.536, 0.934, and 0.458, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A 24-month structured, moderate-intensity physical activity program  reduced cognitive frailty compared with a health education program in sedentary older persons, and this beneficial effect did not differ according to baseline levels of inflammatory biomarker IL-6. These findings suggest that the new cognitive frailty construct is modifiable and highlight the potential of targeting cognitive frailty for promoting healthy aging.

"Optogenetics is a recently developed experimental technique to control the activity of neurons using light. Optogenetics shows its power to reveal the physiological role of specific neural circuits in the brain. In particular, manipulation of a specific type of neurons using optogenetics with high accuracy timing enables us to analyze causality between neural activity and initiation of animal behaviors. However, to manipulate the activity of specific neurons in vivo, there are two critical steps to succeed in manipulation of the neural activity and control of the behavior of individual animals. The first step is an adequate number of molecules of light-activated protein that has to be expressed in the cell membrane of the neurons of interest. The second step is the optical system to illuminate the targeted neurons with enough intensity of light to activate the light-activated protein. We applied optogenetics to hypothalamic peptidergic neurons such as orexin/hypocretin neurons or melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons. These neurons are implicated in sleep/wakefulness regulation. In this mini review, I will show the regulatory mechanism of sleep/wakefulness by these neurons using optogenetics.",1
"BACKGROUND: Occupational support workers in the mental healthcare sector are exposed to considerable occupational stress and have little access to stress management facilities. AIMS: This article describes the process behind creating a web-based stress management intervention (SMI) for occupational support workers in the mental healthcare sector. METHOD: Mixed methods were used to inform the content of the web-based SMI, following MRC strategy for designing interventions and PRIMA-EF guidelines for best practice in SMI design. We conducted a literature review to ascertain the content of interventions that had been shown to be successful in reducing stress  in mental healthcare populations. In addition, we conducted focus groups in order to assess specific stressors that individuals in the occupational support sector  deemed to be important. RESULTS: The literature review showed that a variety of methods had been successful for reducing occupational stress in the mental healthcare sector including: Relaxation and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy techniques, and skills training in; time management, problem-solving and communication. Individuals in the focus groups identified both personal and organisational stressors to be addressed in the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This intervention was developed with reference to a design strategy, using input from the target population.",0
"BACKGROUND: Most of original studies indicated maternal violence experiences is associated with adverse obstetric outcomes, to date, but it is not clear that the association of maternal violence experiences and the risk of postpartum depression (PPD). We aimed to assess the association between maternal violence experiences and risk of developing PPD by performing a meta-analysis of cohort studies. METHODS: PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Libraries and Chinese databases were searched through December 2017 to identify studies that assessed the association  between violence and PPD. Meta-analysis was conducted by the RevMan software and  Stata software. Potential heterogeneity source was explored by subgroup analysis  and potential publication bias was assessed by Begg's funnel plots and Egger's linear regression test. RESULTS: Overall, women experiencing any violence events compared with the reference group were at a higher risk of developing PPD (odds ratio [OR] = 2.04;  95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.72-2.41). Additionally, different types of violence events such as sexual (OR = 1.56; 95%CI: 1.35-1.81), emotional (OR = 1.75; 95%CI: 1.61-1.89), and physical violence (OR = 1.90; 95%CI: 1.36-2.67), as well as domestic (OR = 2.05; 95%CI: 1.50-2.80) or childhood violence (OR = 1.59; 95%CI: 1.34-1.88) also increased the risk of developing PPD. Relevant heterogeneity moderators have been identified by subgroup analysis. Sensitivity analysis yielded consistent results. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal violence experiences are significantly associated with risk of developing PPD. These finding highlight the necessary to protect women from any types of violence and formulate preventive strategies to promote the maternal mental health.",0
"BACKGROUND: Psychotropic medication use in pregnancy has been associated with altered fetal growth. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between placental weight and placental weight-to-birth weight (PBW) ratio, as a potential marker of placental efficiency, and medication use in a cohort of women with severe mental illness in pregnancy. METHODS: A retrospective database analysis was carried out on a cohort of pregnant women with severe mental illness (242 singleton pregnancies) and grouped according to their psychotropic medication use. Demographic, obstetric, neonatal, and psychiatric variables were analyzed using t tests, χ, analysis of variance, univariate, binary, and multiple regression adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis demonstrated a mean adjusted increase in placental weight of 114 g (95% confidence interval [CI], 60.2-165.6 g) in women taking antidepressant medication and 113 g (CI, 65.1-162.8 g) in women taking combined antidepressant and atypical antipsychotic medication in pregnancy. There was also a significantly elevated PBW ratio in these 2 medication groups (B 0.02: CI, 0.006-0.034; and B 0.025: CI, 0.012-0.038). Binary regression, adjusted for sex and gestational age, showed a significant odds ratio of 4.57 (95% CI, 2.17-9.62) for PBW ratio of greater than 90% in those taking antidepressant medication, either alone or in combination, compared with unmedicated women. CONCLUSIONS: The use of antidepressant medication, alone or in combination, has a significant effect on placental weight and PBW ratio after adjusting for confounding variables. Given that this may reflect adverse effects on intrauterine growth and have possible long-term implications for the fetus, further research is warranted to confirm these findings.",0
"Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to magnetic transcranial stimulation (TCS) were simultaneously and bilaterally recorded from flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor communis digitorum (ECD) muscles in seven healthy and trained subjects.  Latencies and amplitudes characteristics of MEPs were investigated under the following randomised conditions: muscular and mental relaxation; mental simulation, during absolute muscular relaxation, selective flexion or extension of the right or left wrist muscles; arithmetical calculation with muscular relaxation. Unspecific, diffuse facilitatory effects on MEPs amplitude were induced by mental non motor activity (arithmetical calculation). A further specific and lateralised amplitude potentiation on the agonist muscle acting as 'prime mover' for the mentally simulated movement was consistently found in all the subjects, without significant latency changes. Inhibitory effects on antagonists were evident only in two subjects.",0
"The finding of orexin (hypocretin) deficiency in patients with narcolepsy suggests that this hypothalamic neuropeptide plays a crucial role in regulating and maintaining sleep/wakefulness states and energy homeostasis. Orexin might be especially important for stabilization of behavioral states, because the major symptom in narcolepsy is instability of each behavioral state, which results in sleep/wakefulness fragmentation. The efferent and afferent systems of orexin neurons suggest interactions between these cells and arousal/sleep-wakefulness centers in the brainstem as well as important feeding centers in the hypothalamus. Electrophysiological studies have shown that orexin neurons are regulated by monoamines and acetylcholine as well as metabolic cues, including leptin, glucose, and ghrelin. Thus, orexin neurons have the requisite functional interactions with hypothalamic feeding pathways and monoaminergic/cholinergic centers, and provide a critical link between peripheral energy balance and the central mechanisms that coordinate sleep/wakefulness and motivated behavior such as food seeking.",1
"The alcohol-preferring (P) rat is a valid animal model of alcoholism. However, the effect of alcohol on sleep in P or alcohol non-preferring (NP) rats is unknown. Since alcohol consumption has tremendous impact on sleep, the present study compared the effects of binge alcohol administration on sleep-wakefulness in P and NP rats. Using standard surgical procedures, the P and NP rats were bilaterally implanted with sleep recording electrodes. Following post-operative recovery and habituation, pre-ethanol (baseline) sleep-wakefulness was electrographically recorded for 48 h. Subsequently, ethanol was administered beginning with a priming dose of 5 g/Kg followed by two doses of 2 g/Kg every 8 h on the first day and three doses of 3 g/Kg/8 h on the second day. On the following day (post-ethanol), undisturbed sleep-wakefulness was electrographically recorded for 24 h. Our initial results suggest that, during baseline conditions, the time spent in each of the three behavioral states: wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and REM sleep, was comparable between P and NP rats. However, the P rats were more susceptible to changes in sleep-wakefulness following 2 days of binge ethanol treatment. As compared to NP rats, the P rats displayed insomnia like symptoms including a significant reduction in the amount of time spent in NREM sleep coupled with a significant increase in wakefulness on post-ethanol day. Subsequent analysis revealed that binge ethanol induced increased wakefulness and reduced NREM sleep in P rats occurred mainly in the dark period. This is the first study that: (1) demonstrates spontaneous sleep-wake profile in P and NP rats, and (2) compares the effects of binge ethanol treatment on sleep in P and NP rats. Our results suggest that, as compared to NP rats, the P rats were more susceptible to sleep disruptions after binge ethanol treatment. In addition, the P rats exhibited insomnia-like symptoms observed during abstinence from alcohol in human subjects.",1
"BACKGROUND: The ""self"" has been implicated in the development of a range of psychological disorders. While a growing body of literature has emerged exploring the Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS), little research has been conducted on the construct of self-hate and its relationship with suicidal ideation. The aims of this study were to: 1) develop and validate a brief self-report instrument of self-hate; and, 2) explore the relationship between self-hate, suicidal ideation, and the two main factors of the IPTS, perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. METHODS: Initial development of the item pool involved an expert panel and the development of the Self-Hate Scale included exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses using a large community sample. RESULTS: A 7-item Self-Hate Scale was developed, which exhibited a reliable unidimensional factor structure. High self-hate was found to predict suicidal ideation, while the relationship between low/moderate self-hate and suicidal ideation was partially moderated by the level of thwarted belongingness. The study provided limited evidence for the IPTS' main predictions. LIMITATIONS: While the current study provided support for the psychometric properties of the Self-Hate Scale, the scale will need to be replicated and validated using clinical populations. CONCLUSIONS: The Self-Hate Scale is a brief, psychometrically valid measure of self-hate that has the potential to be useful in suicide risk assessment.",0
"BACKGROUND: It is known that healthcare providers might be affected by severe medical events in which patients are badly hurt. In birth care, escalating situations can result in death or injury to a mother or new-born child. OBJECTIVE: To explore the process that Swedish midwives and obstetricians go through after a severe event in the maternity unit. DESIGN: A modified Constructivist Grounded Theory analysis, based on fourteen in-depth interviews with birth care professionals. PARTICIPANTS: Seven midwives and seven obstetricians. RESULTS: A core category, 'regaining of a professional self-image', was constructed and interpreted as being constituted of six main categories illustrating a frequently erratic pathway to the regaining of a professional self-image. The process included a search for external acceptance for the re-establishment of belongingness by obtaining corroboration from the woman, work colleagues and manager, and the medico-legal system. Media exposure was invariably seen as something negative. Internal processes involved coping with emotions of guilt and shame and the vulnerability that the work entails, as well  as contemplating future work. The possibility to fully regain one's professional  self-image depended on having a sense of confidence and an urge to support others in similar situations by sharing gained insights. However, the process could also result in reconsidering one's professional self-image by setting up boundaries, creating a better work-life balance, or creating mental back-up plans in case of  similar recurrences. For others, the process led to a change of professional identity and a search for roles away from emergency obstetrics or the specialty as such. CONCLUSIONS: Many midwives and obstetricians will experience severe obstetric events that might affect them, sometimes severely. The vulnerability that healthcare professionals are exposed to should not be underestimated and preparedness in terms of collegial support, as well as an awareness in the workplace of how badly affected employees might be, is important. Growth as well  as leaving birth care can be the results of the process following a severe event.",0
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We will evaluate the usefulness of the new intrathecal analgesic ziconotide in palliative care medicine. We will also examine the place  and efficacy of neurolytic celiac plexus blockade in patients suffering from malignancy in the upper abdomen, after introducing better localization methods of the celiac plexus. RECENT FINDINGS: The analgesic effects of intrathecally administered ziconotide have been studied in patients suffering from pain due to AIDS or cancer. The results show a moderate to complete pain relief, significantly better than in placebo groups. However, safety studies show a high incidence of side effects. The technique of neurolytic celiac plexus blocks is refined by endoscopic ultrasound techniques. SUMMARY: The place of ziconotide in palliative care is doubtful due to unpredictable and sometimes long-lasting side effects. Real evidence on the efficacy and duration of neurolytic celiac plexus blocks for relief of pancreatic cancer pain is still not available. Future studies will need to be performed applying validated measurement instruments and assessing the patient's impression of the procedure's demands in terms of physical and mental tolerance.",0
The state of sleep/wakefulness is well known to influence esophageal acid exposure and the number of acid refluxes whereas it is uncertain whether the same is true of the non-acid refluxes that predominate in the newborns. To investigate the relationship between sleep/wakefulness and refluxes 45 newborns with gastroesophageal reflux symptoms were studied with combined multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH monitoring. We found that sleep/wakefulness influenced acid and weakly acidic reflux frequency (awake 2.6+/-0.8; asleep 2.1+/-1.1; p=0.006). A negative correlation was found between sleepness periods and the mean reflux duration for both acid (R=0.55;p < 0.001) and weackly acidic (R=0.51;p < 0.001) refluxes. This finding may raise some concerns about the over-prescription of antacid drugs in newborns.,1
"BACKGROUND: Achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target levels after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is of paramount importance, and is often burdened by undertreatment and medication or lifestyle non-adherence issues. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effect of a patient-centered, physician-led motivational intervention following ACS on relevant secondary prevention aspects. METHODS-DESIGN: The IDEAL-LDL is a single-center, randomized controlled clinical  trial, conducted among patients hospitalized due to an ACS. Following discharge,  all patients undergo a baseline assessment of lipid profile. Patients in the intervention group receive an in-person educational session and an informative leaflet, and also undergo two phone-based, motivational interviewing sessions at  1 and 6 months. These interventions emphasize on LDL-C goals, adherence to lipid-lowering medication, and healthy dietary-lifestyle habits, and are not provided to patients in the control group, who receive usual care. At 12 months after each patient's discharge, an in-person interview and lipid profile reassessment are performed. The primary outcomes are the assessment of LDL-C goal achievement (<70 mg/dL or >50% reduction from baseline levels) from baseline to 1 year and changes in medication adherence. Secondary outcomes relate to the incidence of the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction/stroke, need for myocardial revascularization, and recurrent hospitalization during the follow-up period. DISCUSSION: This paper describes the protocol, design, and rationale for key methodology for an ongoing clinical trial featuring a simple and feasible intervention. Similar adherence efficacy trials have not led to sufficient improvements, and there remains a gap regarding how adherence interventions should be implemented into clinical care.",0
"BACKGROUND: Anesthesia and surgery disturb sleep. Disturbed sleep adversely affects postoperative complications involving the cardiovascular system, diabetes, and infection. General anesthetics share neuronal mechanisms involving endogenous sleep-wakefulness-related substances, such as orexin (OX) and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH). We evaluated changes in sleep architecture and the concentration of OX and MCH during the peri-anesthetic period. METHODS: To examine sleep architecture, male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 350-450 g received ketamine 100 mg/kg (n = 9) or propofol 80 mg/kg (n = 6) by intraperitoneal injection. Electroencephalography was recorded from 2 days pre- to 5 days postanesthesia. To quantify levels of OX and MCH, 144 similar rats received the same doses of ketamine (n = 80) or propofol (n = 64). Brain concentrations of these substances were determined at 0, 20, 60, and 120 min after anesthetic administration. RESULTS: Ketamine decreased OX content in the hypothalamus during the anesthesia period. OX content was restored to pre-anesthesia levels in the hypothalamus and pons. Both anesthetics increased brain MCH content in the postanesthetic period, with the degree of increase being greater with propofol. Ketamine enhanced wakefulness and inhibited non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) immediately after anesthesia. Conversely, propofol inhibited wakefulness and enhanced NREMS in that period. Ketamine inhibited wakefulness and enhanced NREMS during the dark phase on the first postanesthesia day. CONCLUSIONS: Anesthetics affect various endogenous sleep-wakefulness-related substances; however, the modulation pattern may depend on the type of anesthetic. The process of postanesthetic sleep disturbance was agent specific. Our results provide fundamental evidence to treat anesthetic-related sleep disturbance.",1
"The effects of the destruction of the medial septal neurons (MS) with N-methyl-d-aspartic acid on sleep-wakefulness (S-W), body temperature (Tb), locomotor activity (LMA) and thermal preference were studied in male Wistar rats. When these rats were given a choice of three ambient temperatures (Tamb) of 24, 27 and 30 degrees C, they preferred 27 degrees C before the lesion. But they chose 30 degrees C during the initial days and 24 degrees C by the third week after the MS lesion. The MS lesion produced an increase in paradoxical sleep (PS) though this change was not very evident when the rats were not allowed to choose their Tamb. Though there was a decrease in slow wave sleep (SWS), it recovered considerably, when the lesioned rats chose their preferred Tamb. However, the frequency of SWS episodes did not show any recovery. There was a decrease in both Tb and LMA by the third week after the MS lesion. It can, therefore, be concluded that the MS lesion affected the initiation of SWS, as there was a decrease in the frequency of SWS episodes. Study of S-W in the rats that were given freedom to select Tamb helped to demonstrate the role of the MS in the inhibition of PS. It also showed that the thermostat of the rats was reset at a lower level by the third week after the MS lesion. Decrease in heat production resulting from a decrease in LMA, could have contributed towards the animals' efforts to maintain a lower Tb.",1
"Grade 4 pressure ulceration is a common and often unavoidable secondary complication for patients who have sustained a traumatic spinal cord injury. Pressure ulcer management involves treating infection, providing a moist wound-healing environment and choosing the appropriate dressing. However, the case of Mr M highlights other issues such as pain, a poor appetite and sleep disturbance, which all delay wound healing. This article discusses ulcer prevention, from the initial assessment of the spinal injury to patient repositioning using the 'log-rolling' technique. Although this technique is not effective in providing prolonged pressure relief, it did reduce Mr M's pain. This article also suggests recommendations for future practice, including the need to  relate to patients on a personal level, which should reduce mental health deterioration and increase the patient's quality of life, and to take a multidisciplinary approach to managing and treating pressure ulceration.",0
"Background: Comprehensive conjoint characterization of long-term trajectories representing several biological systems are lacking. Methods: We measured serially indicators representing 14 distinct biological systems in up to 3453 participants attending four Framingham Study examinations:  bone mineral density, body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein, glomerular filtration rate, forced vital capacity (FVC), one-second forced expiratory volume/FVC ratio (FEV1/FVC), gait speed, grip strength, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), heart rate, left ventricular mass, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), pulse pressure, and total/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TC/HDL). Results: We observed that correlations among the 14 sex-specific trajectories were modest (r<0.30 for 169 of 182 sex-specific correlations). During follow-up (median 8 years), 232 individuals experienced a CVD event and 393 participants died. In multivariable regression models, CVD incidence was positively related to trajectories of BMI, HbA1c, TC/HDL, gait time, and pulse pressure (P<0.06); mortality risk was related directly to trajectories of gait time, C-reactive protein, heart rate, and pulse pressure but inversely to MMSE, and FEV1/FVC (P<0.006). A unit increase in the trajectory risk score was associated a 2.80-fold risk of CVD (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.04-3.84, P<0.001), and a 2.71-fold risk of death (95% CI, 2.30-3.20, P<0.001). Trajectory risk scores were suggestive of a greater increase in model c-statistic compared to single occasion measures (delta-c compared to age- and sex-adjusted models: 0.032 vs. 0.026 for CVD; 0.042 vs. 0.030 for mortality). Conclusion: Biological systems age differentially over the life course. Longitudinal data on a parsimonious set of biomarkers reflecting key biological systems may facilitate identification of high-risk individuals.",0
"BACKGROUND: Physical literacy is the foundation of a physically active lifestyle. Sedentary behaviour displays deleterious associations with important health indicators in children. However, the association between sedentary behaviour and  physical literacy is unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify the aspects of physical literacy that are associated with key modes of sedentary behaviour among Canadian children participating in the RBC-CAPL Learn to Play study. METHODS: A total of 8,307 children aged 8.0-12.9 years were included in the present analysis. Physical literacy was assessed using the Canadian Assessment of Physical Literacy, which measures four domains (Physical Competence, Daily Behaviour, Motivation and Confidence, Knowledge and Understanding). Screen-based  sedentary behaviours (TV viewing, computer and video game use), non-screen sedentary behaviours (reading, doing homework, sitting and talking to friends, drawing, etc.) and total sedentary behaviour were assessed via self-report questionnaire. Linear regression models were used to determine significant (p<0.05) correlates of each mode of sedentary behaviour. RESULTS: In comparison to girls, boys reported more screen time (2.7±2.0 vs 2.2±1.8 hours/day, Cohen's d=0.29), and total sedentary behaviour (4.3±2.6 vs 3.9±2.4 hours/day, Cohen's d=0.19), but lower non-screen-based sedentary behaviour (1.6±1.3 vs 1.7±1.3 hours/day, Cohen's d=0.08) (all p< 0.05). Physical  Competence (standardized β's: -0.100 to -0.036, all p<0.05) and Motivation and Confidence (standardized β's: -0.274 to -0.083, all p<0.05) were negatively associated with all modes of sedentary behaviour in fully adjusted models. Knowledge and Understanding was negatively associated with screen-based modes of  sedentary behaviour (standardized β's: -0.039 to -0.032, all p<0.05), and positively associated with non-screen sedentary behaviour (standardized β: 0.098, p<0.05). Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run score and log-transformed plank score were negatively associated with all screen-based modes of sedentary behaviour, while the Canadian Agility and Movement Skill Assessment score was negatively associated with all modes of sedentary behaviour  other than TV viewing (all p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight differences in the ways that screen and non-screen sedentary behaviours relate to physical literacy. Public health interventions should continue to target screen-based sedentary behaviours, given  their potentially harmful associations with important aspects of physical literacy.",0
"BACKGROUND: Peak sound levels during sleep can compromise the development of hospitalized infants. Quiet time is a strategy implemented in neonatal units to promote the sleeping of neonates by reducing noise levels, luminosity, and handling during particular periods of the day. PURPOSE: To determine the impact of quiet time on reducing sound levels and increasing total sleep time. METHODS: This longitudinal study was conducted at a neonatal intermediate care unit with a convenience sample of 12 premature infants. Four times per day, 60-minute quiet times were provided in the neonatal unit. Sleep-awake states and sound levels were evaluated during quiet times as well as 60 minutes before and afterward. Polysomnography was used for sleep-awake state assessment, and a noise dosimeter was used to check sound levels every 24 hours. RESULTS: The preterm infants had a corrected gestational age of 35.0 +/- 1.5 weeks and weighed 1606.0 +/- 317.8 g. Total sleep time was highest during quiet time (P = .005). Premature infants remained awake for longer following quiet times (P = .005). There was also a reduction in sound level during quiet times compared with the other time frames (P = .006). No statistically significant relationship was found between total sleep time and sound levels more than 24 hours. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Quiet time is a nursing intervention that should be implemented in all neonatal units. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Future research should use a greater sample size and other factors that influence sleep should be further investigated.",1
"INTRODUCTION: The hypocretins/orexins are neuropeptides synthesized by a small neuronal cell group located in the posterior and lateral hypothalamus. These peptides have been considered modulators of the sleep-wakefulness cycle since their discovery in 1998; the hypocretinergic/orexinergic system is very active during wakefulness. In addition, the absence of either these peptides or their receptors is associated to narcolepsy-cataplexy, a disease in which the sleep-wakefulness cycle is completely disorganized. DEVELOPMENT: Hypocretinergic/orexinergic neurons directly activate the cerebral cortex and neuronal cell groups of the reticular activating system containing noradrenaline, serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine and histamine, through which they may also indirectly activate the cerebral cortex and enhance wakefulness; as well, these neurons inhibit REM sleep generation in the ventral pontine tegmentum. The decrease in the activity of hypocretinergic/orexinergic neurons during sleep inhibits the aminergic and cholinergic neurons of the reticular activating core, decreasing cortical activation and renewing REM sleep generation in the ventral pontine tegmentum. CONCLUSIONS: Hypocretins/orexins modulate wakefulness and EEG activation in part through their actions on reticular core neurons projecting to the cortex and suppress REM sleep generation through inhibition of ventral pontine tegmentum neurons within the ventral oral pontine tegmentum. The hypoactivity of this system supports the sleep cycle fragmentation and general disorganization appearing in narcolepsy, as well as momentary interruption of wakefulness by REM sleep episodes.",1

"BACKGROUND: Infants exposed to opioides in-utero frequently demonstrate withdrawal symptoms in the neonatal period and have difficulties with state regulation. AIM: This study examines sleep-wakefulness-distress patterns as indicators of regulatory mechanisms at 3 months of age. PARTICIPANTS: A national infant cohort (N=35) born to women in high-dose maintenance treatment during pregnancy and a comparison group (N=36) of low-risk infants born in the same period. OUTCOME MEASURES: Distributions and frequencies of sleep, wakefulness and distress measured in hours and episodes on sleep charts recorded by the mothers in the two groups. RESULTS: Women in maintenance treatment were monitored closely during pregnancy to avoid illicit drug use and to be prepared for motherhood. They were also offered residential treatment before pregnancy and after the child was born. There were no statistical differences between the two groups in any of the 10 measures reflecting diurnal and nocturnal rhythmicity at 3 months despite of neonatal abstinence syndrome in 47% of the exposed infants and significant differences in infant characteristics with respect to birth weight, gestational age and maternal characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Follow-up procedures combining drug monitoring and counseling during pregnancy and in the first months after birth enhance the development of state regulation in terms of sleep-wakefulness patterns.",1
"BACKGROUND: Evidence from diverse areas of medicine (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes) indicates that healthcare providers (HCPs) often do not adhere to clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) despite a clear indication to implement recommendations-a phenomenon commonly termed clinical inertia. There are a variety of reasons for clinical inertia, but HCP-related factors (e.g., knowledge, motivation, agreement with guidelines) are the most salient and amenable to intervention aimed to improve adherence. CPGs have been developed to  support the safe and effective prescription of opioid medication for the management of chronic non-cancer pain. The extent of physician uptake and adherence to such guidelines is not yet well understood. The purpose of this review is to synthesize the published evidence about knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and practices that HCPs hold regarding the prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. METHODS: An experienced information specialist will perform searches of CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO bibliographic databases. The Cochrane library, PROSPERO, and the Joanna Briggs Institute will be searched for systematic reviews. Searches will be performed from inception to the present. Quantitative and qualitative study designs that report on HCP knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, or practices in North America will be eligible for inclusion. Studies reporting on interventions to improve HCP adherence to opioid prescribing CPGs will also be eligible for inclusion. Two trained graduate-level research assistants will independently screen articles for inclusion, perform data extraction, and perform risk of bias and quality assessment using recommended tools. Confidence in qualitative evidence will be evaluated using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation-Confidence in the Evidence from Qualitative Reviews (GRADE-CERQual) approach. Confidence in quantitative evidence will be assessed using the GRADE approach. DISCUSSION: The ultimate goal of this work is to support interventions aiming to  optimize opioid prescribing practices in order to prevent opioid-related morbidity and mortality without restricting a HCP's ability to select the most appropriate treatment for an individual patient.

"INTRODUCTION: Promoting physical activity (PA) and reducing sedentary behaviour (SB) may exert beneficial effects on the older adult population, improving behavioural, functional, health and psychosocial outcomes in addition to reducing health, social care and personal costs. This paper describes the planned economic evaluation of SITLESS, a multicountry three-armed pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) which aims to assess the short-term and long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a complex intervention on SB and PA in community-dwelling older adults, based on exercise referral schemes enhanced by a group intervention providing self-management strategies to encourage lifestyle change. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A within-trial economic evaluation and long-term model from both a National Health Service/personal social services perspective and a broader societal perspective will be undertaken alongside the SITLESS multinational RCT.  Healthcare costs (hospitalisations, accident and emergency visits, appointment with health professionals) and social care costs (eg, community care) will be included in the economic evaluation. For the cost-utility analysis, quality-adjusted life-years will be measured using the EQ-5D-5L and capability well-being measured using the ICEpop CAPability measure for Older people (ICECAP-O) questionnaire. Other effectiveness outcomes (health related, behavioural, functional) will be incorporated into a cost-effectiveness analysis  and cost-consequence analysis.The multinational nature of this RCT implies a hierarchical structure of the data and unobserved heterogeneity between clusters  that needs to be adequately modelled with appropriate statistical and econometric techniques. In addition, a long-term population health economic model will be developed and will synthesise and extrapolate within-trial data with additional data extracted from the literature linking PA and SB outcomes with longer term health states.Methods guidance for population health economic evaluation will be  adopted including the use of a long-time horizon, 1.5% discount rate for costs and benefits, cost consequence analysis framework and a multisector perspective. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study design was approved by the ethics and research committee of each intervention site: the Ethics and Research Committee of Ramon Llull University (reference number: 1314001P) (Fundació Blanquerna, Spain), the Regional Committees on Health Research Ethics for Southern Denmark (reference number: S-20150186) (University of Southern Denmark, Denmark), Office  for Research Ethics Committees in Northern Ireland (ORECNI reference number: 16/NI/0185) (Queen's University of Belfast) and the Ethical Review Board of Ulm University (reference number: 354/15) (Ulm, Germany).

"Although media exposure has been related to cognitive preoccupation with appearance, research rarely investigated adolescents' behavioral self-sexualization. To address this gap, the present study among 12- to 16-year-olds (N = 1527; 50.2% girls) in Austria, Belgium, Spain, and South-Korea  (1) investigates whether different types of media use relate to self-sexualization, (2) explores the explanatory value of rewarded appearance ideals, and (3) considers culture and gender as moderating factors. Despite cultural variation, a general trend of increasing self-sexualization with social  media use and magazine reading appeared across the countries. Moreover, women's magazine reading and rewards were related to self-sexualization among all the girls across the countries, which suggests that girls may be more vulnerable to the examined effects. Overall, this study provides a better understanding of the  unique contribution of specific media genres to youth's self-sexualization and points at the importance of social media use in girls' and boys' engagement in sexualizing appearance behaviors across four countries.",0
"Facebook, as one of the most popular social networking sites among college students, provides a platform for people to manage others' impressions of them. People tend to present themselves in a favorable way on their Facebook profile. This research examines the impact of using Facebook on people's perceptions of others' lives. It is argued that those with deeper involvement with Facebook will have different perceptions of others than those less involved due to two reasons. First, Facebook users tend to base judgment on examples easily recalled (the availability heuristic). Second, Facebook users tend to attribute the positive content presented on Facebook to others' personality, rather than situational factors (correspondence bias), especially for those they do not know personally.  Questionnaires, including items measuring years of using Facebook, time spent on  Facebook each week, number of people listed as their Facebook ""friends,"" and perceptions about others' lives, were completed by 425 undergraduate students taking classes across various academic disciplines at a state university in Utah. Surveys were collected during regular class period, except for two online classes where surveys were submitted online. The multivariate analysis indicated that those who have used Facebook longer agreed more that others were happier, and agreed less that life is fair, and those spending more time on Facebook each week agreed more that others were happier and had better lives. Furthermore, those that included more people whom they did not personally know as their Facebook ""friends"" agreed more that others had better lives.",0
"Restricted sugar intake is an important part of a healthy lifestyle and may contribute to the prevention of diet-related diseases. The aim of the study was to investigate whether declared sugar restriction is reflected in actual sucrose  intake and diet quality of young non-dieting women, with differentiation between  the weekend and weekdays. A convenient sample of 192 non-dieting women aged 20⁻30 years old was recruited. The sample was divided into two groups based on each woman's declaration: ""restricting sugar"" (RS, n = 76) and ""not restricting sugar"" (nRS, n = 116). Comparisons between groups were made separately for seven days of the week, five weekdays and two weekend days without and with an adjustment for 2000 kcal of energy. Relative differences (RD, in %) in mean diet nutritional values between groups were calculated, where RD (%) = (RS - nRS) × 100/nRS, and were verified with a two-tailed t-test. In the seven-day diet of the RS group, in comparison to the nRS group, a lower daily intake of sucrose (by 22%) and MUFA (by 8%) and a higher content of most nutrients (by 7⁻38%) was found. No significant differences were observed in energy intake between RS and nRS women over the course of seven days, including weekdays and the weekend. Daily intake for the weekend, in comparison to weekdays, in RC and nRC women was higher with respect to energy (by 530 and 512 kcal, i.e., 37% and 34%, respectively), sucrose (44% and 23%, respectively), and most nutrients (by 17⁻98% and 16⁻42%, respectively). However, after the adjustment for 2000 kcal of energy, the daily intake of most nutrients in the weekend was lower (by 6⁻30% and 3⁻27%, in RS and  nRS groups, respectively), than during weekdays. The intention to restrict sucrose has improved diet quality by decreasing sucrose intake and increasing the content of most nutrients, but had no effect on energy intake throughout the week. The quality of the women's diet during the weekend was compromised, regardless of restricting or not restricting sugar. Encouragement to restrict sugar intake throughout the week and control the food intake during the weekend may be an effective strategy for young women to maintain a healthy diet.",0
"In response to the 2004 tsunami disaster in the Indian Ocean, the U.S. Navy deployed teams aboard the USNS Mercy to provide aid during Operation Unified Assistance (OUA). To date, few research studies have examined how Navy nurses prepared for and clinically performed during this relief operation. The current article describes the challenges faced by Navy nurses throughout OUA. A purposive convenience sample was recruited; 11 participated. Data were collected from interviews, observations, field notes, memos, and a demographic tool. Information was categorized, coded, compared to incoming data, then analyzed using Strauss and Corbin's open coding, axial coding, and selective coding methods. A theoretical model was developed to illustrate how participants experienced the mission. Key lessons learned were that most were unprepared for providing pediatric care, and saying ""No"" in delivering care. Recommendations include: deployment of advanced-practice nurses (specialists in pediatrics and well-mental health) and predeployment training on moral distress.",0
"Pannexins are membrane channel proteins that play a role in a number of critical biological processes (Panchin et al., 2000; Shestopalov, Panchin, 2008). Among other cellular functions, pannexin hemichannels serve as purine nucleoside conduits providing ATP efflux into the extracellular space (Dahl, 2015), where it is rapidly degraded to adenosine. Pannexin1 (Panx1) is abundantly expressed in the brain and has been shown to contribute to adenosine signaling in nervous system tissues (Prochnow et al., 2012). We hypothesized that pannexin1 may contribute to sleep-wake cycle regulation through extracellular adenosine, a well-established paracrine factor in slow wave sleep. To investigate this link, EEG and movement activity throughout the light/dark cycle were compared in Panx1(-/-) and Panx1(+/+) mice. We found a significant increase in waking and a correspondent decrease in slow wave sleep percentages in the Panx1(-/-) animals. These changes were especially pronounced during the dark period. Furthermore, we found a significant increase in movement activity of Panx1(-/-) mice. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that extracellular adenosine is relatively depleted in Panx1(-/-) animals due to the absence of the ATP-permeable hemichannels. At the same time, sleep rebound after a 6-h sleep deprivation remained unchanged in Panx1(-/-) mice as compared to the control animals. Behavioral tests revealed that Panx1(-/-) mice were significantly faster during their descent along the vertical pole but more sluggish during their run through the horizontal pole as compared to the control mice.",1
"INTRODUCTION: This study explores the patient opinions about the helpfulness of the External Rehabilitative Activities (ERA) delivered in two residential facilities for psychiatric rehabilitation. METHODS: We administered a Questionnaire developed to assess general helpfulness, helpfulness of specific therapeutic processes and satisfaction with the ERA to a  sample of 46 psychiatric patients participating in at least three external activities. RESULTS: The External Rehabilitative Activities, tested by the ERA-Questionnaire, were considered helpful or very helpful by most of the patients. The therapeutic  process with the highest score was ""relaxation"", followed by ""general helpfulness"", ""socialization"", ""knowledge of social context"", ""community integration"". The least-valued process was ""autonomy"". CONCLUSION: This pilot study has shown that psychiatric patients consider ERA helpful and rate more helpful the specific therapeutic processes, such as relaxation and socialization, that assure symptomatic relief and interaction with the outside world.",0
"Using functional MRI (fMRI) we investigated 13 upper limb amputees with phantom limb pain (PLP) during hand and lip movement, before and after intensive 6-week training in mental imagery. Prior to training, activation elicited during lip purse showed evidence of cortical reorganization of motor (M1) and somatosensory  (S1) cortices, expanding from lip area to hand area, which correlated with pain scores. In addition, during imagined movement of the phantom hand, and executed movement of the intact hand, group maps demonstrated activation not only in bilateral M1 and S1 hand area, but also lip area, showing a two-way process of reorganization. In healthy participants, activation during lip purse and imagined and executed movement of the non-dominant hand was confined to the respective cortical representation areas only. Following training, patients reported a significant reduction in intensity and unpleasantness of constant pain and exacerbations, with a corresponding elimination of cortical reorganization. Post  hoc analyses showed that intensity of constant pain, but not exacerbations, correlated with reduction in cortical reorganization. The results of this study add to our current understanding of the pathophysiology of PLP, underlining the reversibility of neuroplastic changes in this patient population while offering a novel, simple method of pain relief.",0
"This study profiles the family-directed anger of traumatized Cambodian refugees,  all survivors of the Pol Pot genocide (1975-1979), who were patients at a psychiatric clinic in Lowell, MA, USA. We focus on the nuclear family (NF) unit,  the NF unit defined as the patient's ""significant other"" (i.e. spouse or boyfriend/girlfriend) and children. Survey data were collected from a convenience sample of 143 Cambodian refugee patients from October 2006 to August 2007. The study revealed that 48% (68/143) of the patients had anger directed toward a NF member in the last month, with anger directed toward children being particularly  common (64 of the 143 patients, or 49% [64/131] of the patients with children). NF-type anger was severe, for example, almost always resulting in somatic arousal (e.g., causing palpitations in 91% [62/68] of the anger episodes) and often in trauma recall and fears of bodily dysfunction. Responses to open-ended questions  revealed the causes of anger toward a significant other and children, the content of anger-associated trauma recall, and what patients did to gain relief from anger. A type of cultural gap, namely, a linguistic gap (i.e., the parent's lack  of English language skills and the child's lack of Khmer language skills), seemingly played a role in generating conflict and anger. NF-type anger was associated with PTSD presence. The effect of anger on PTSD severity resulted in part from anger-associated trauma recall and fears of bodily dysfunction, with 54% of the variance in PTSD severity explained by that regression model. The study: 1) suggests that among traumatized refugees, family-related anger is a major clinical concern; 2) illustrates how family-related anger may be profiled and investigated in trauma-exposed populations; and 3) gives insights into how family-related anger is generated in such populations.",0
"Distributed neural networks in the brain sustain generation of wakefulness and two sleep states: non-REM sleep and REM sleep. These three behavioral states are jointly ingrained in a rhythmic sequence that constitutes the sleep-wakefulness cycle. This paper reviews and updates knowledge about the involvement of the histaminergic system in sleep-wakefulness cycle organization. Histaminergic neurons are exclusively located in the hypothalamic tuberomammillary nucleus, but are the source of a widespread projection system to many brain regions. Histamine neurons are active during waking, especially with high attention need, and remain silent in both non-REM and REM sleep. There have been described four metabotropic histamine receptors, of which H1R, H2R and H3R are present in the nervous system. H1R and H2R are mainly postsynaptic heteroreceptors, whereas H3R is thought to be mostly a presynaptic auto- and hetero-receptor. Histaminergic neurons are excited by hypocretinergic neurons and most of the arousing hypocretin effects are thought to depend on histaminergic actions. Interactions among histaminergic axons and cholinergic nuclei within forebrain and brainstem are particularly important for cortical activation. In contrast, histaminergic tuberomammillary neurons, similarly to other aminergic neurons in locus coeruleus or dorsal raphe nucleus, are inhibited by non-REM sleep-promoting neurons of the preoptic region. Further inhibitory actions on histamine neurons come from adenosine release on tuberomammillary region. Finally, histaminergic neurons inhibit REM-on hypothalamic neurons containing melanine-concentrating hormone, thus supporting a permissive role of tuberomammillary nucleus in REM sleep. Actually, knockout mice for histidine decarboxylase, the enzyme synthetizing histamine, show a significant REM sleep increase.",1
"Orexin A and orexin B are hypothalamic neuropeptides that play critical roles in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness, as well as in a variety of physiological functions such as emotion, reward, and energy homeostasis. The actions of orexins are mediated by two receptors, orexin 1 (OX1R) and orexin 2 (OX2R) receptors. OX1R and OX2R show partly overlapping but distinct distributions throughout the central nervous system, suggesting their differential roles. This review presents and discusses the current knowledge concerning the physiological roles of each orexin receptor subtype, focusing on the regulation of sleep/wakefulness.",1
"Electroencephalographic recording was performed in 11 patients graded by the Silva's Method under basal conditions and under ""dynamic meditation"". Previous papers showed changes in the EEG of subjects who practice diverse methods of meditation and relaxation. Our results reveal a significant increase in the mean  values of the alpha potency in occipital -01, 02- and temporal--T3, T4--areas, while subjects were practicing dynamic meditation.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL) agents are typically tasked with maximizing a single objective function such as reward. But it remains poorly understood how agents might pursue distinct objectives at once. In machines, multiobjective RL can be achieved by dividing a single agent into multiple sub-agents, each of which is shaped by agent-specific reinforcement, but it remains unknown if animals adopt this strategy. Here we use songbirds to test if navigation and singing, two behaviors with distinct objectives, can be differentially reinforced. We demonstrate that strobe flashes aversively condition place preference but not song syllables. Brief noise bursts aversively condition song syllables but positively reinforce place preference. Thus distinct behavior-generating systems, or agencies, within a single animal can be shaped by correspondingly distinct reinforcement signals. Our findings suggest that spatially segregated vocal circuits can solve a credit assignment problem associated with multiobjective learning.",0
"STUDY OBJECTIVES: This study tested the hypothesis that Regulators of G protein Signaling (RGS) proteins contribute to the regulation of wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and to sleep disruption caused by volatile anesthetics. METHODS: The three groups used in this study included wild-type (WT; n = 7) mice and knock-in mice that were heterozygous (+/GS; n = 7) or homozygous (GS/GS; n = 7) for an RGS-insensitive allele that causes prolonged Galphai2 signaling. Mice were implanted with electrodes for recording sleep and conditioned for 1 week or more to sleep in the laboratory. Using within and between groups designs, 24-h recordings of wakefulness, NREM sleep, and REM sleep were compared across three interventions: (1) baseline (control) and after 3 h of being anesthetized with (2) isoflurane or (3) sevoflurane. RESULTS: Baseline recordings during the light phase revealed that relative to WT mice, homozygous RGS-insensitive (GS/GS) mice exhibit significantly increased wakefulness and decreased NREM and REM sleep. During the dark phase, these state-specific differences remained significant but reversed direction of change. After cessation of isoflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia there was a long-lasting and significant disruption of sleep and wakefulness. The durations of average episodes of wakefulness, NREM sleep, and REM sleep were significantly altered as a function of genotype and isoflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: RGS proteins and Galphai2 play a significant role in regulating states of wakefulness, NREM sleep, and REM sleep. Genotype-specific differences demonstrate that RGS proteins modulate sleep disruption caused by isoflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia. The results also support the conclusion that isoflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia do not satisfy the homeostatic drive for sleep.",1
"BACKGROUND: Cancer screening provides an opportunity to increase awareness of cancer-preventive lifestyle behaviors such as nonsmoking, physical activity, low  alcohol consumption, and a healthy diet. We tested the effect of standardized, individually tailored written feedback (TF), and a standard leaflet (SL) on 1-year lifestyle behaviors in a colorectal cancer screening setting. METHODS: A total of 3,642 men and women aged 50-74 years invited to sigmoidoscopy screening were randomly assigned to: (i) TF; (ii) SL for cancer-preventive lifestyle behaviors; or (iii) control. Participants were mailed two self-reported lifestyle questionnaires (LSQ) 1 year apart. The TF intervention was based on the prescreening LSQ answers. We analyzed differences [with 95% confidence intervals  (CI)] by comparing prescreening to 1-year follow-up of single cancer-preventive factors and the number of cancer-preventive lifestyle behaviors (range 0-4) between the groups by multivariable logistic regression and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). RESULTS: A total of 1,054 screening participants without neoplastic findings (29% of those invited to screening) were included in this study. Participants in the TF group increased their number of cancer-preventive lifestyle behaviors significantly compared with those in the control group by 0.11 (95% CI, 0.02 to 0.19). Overweight/obese individuals in the TF group had a -0.84 kg (95% CI, -1.47 to -0.22) larger reduction in body weight compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: TF at sigmoidoscopy screening led to small improvements in cancer-preventive behaviors. IMPACT: Colorectal cancer screening is a suitable setting for increasing awareness of cancer-preventive behavior.",0
"There are many kinds of traditional healers in Cambodia, mostly in the rural areas. People often seek advice from monks at the pagoda, traditional doctors (kru khmer) or mediums when they are ill, and consult medical practitioners only  as a last resort. Each of these healers provides a different solution and form of care. Traditional healers are difficult to find in France and they often work in  secret. Monks teach meditation rather than magic, brahmanism and superstition. There are now Khmer in Cambodia who have returned after long and complex treatments in general and psychiatric hospitals in France, seeking a release from suffering in their motherland. They seek an alternative understanding of their problems and a different kind of care, based largely on witchcraft and spiritual  possession, which is not available in France. Returning to Cambodia is important  because they are allowed to live according to their beliefs without being seen as insane. However, this return also involves confrontation with the lost country and the past, with war and the Killing Fields, in the same place as the trauma itself occurred. Several cases illustrate the healing nature of the return and emphasize the importance of a culturally sensitive interpretation of the patient's symptoms, which may express cultural bereavement and do not fit easily  into international psychiatric categories. This requires much careful attention and listening to the patient.",0
"This study examines the effectiveness of therapeutic conversations with families  (through family sessions) in alleviating health complaints among adolescent girls in a school setting. Four girls with recurrent, subjective health complaints and  their families were included in the study. Three sessions were held with each family, using genograms, ecomaps, interventive questions, and other family nursing interventions; practicing school nurses were also present. A therapeutic  letter was sent to each family at the end of the sessions. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was used as a pre- and posttest measure. Evaluative interviews were carried out with the families and with school nurses. The families reported feeling relief and described positive affective, behavioral, and cognitive changes as a consequence of the interventions. The school nurses experienced the family sessions as time-saving and easy-to-use tools in their work. Involving the family when schoolchildren's recurrent mental health problems are addressed may reduce future suffering.",0
"The aim of our study was to investigate the role of dopaminergic system in telencephalic and diencephalic brain regions of vertebrates in sleep-wakefulness cycle. The level of thyrosine-hydroxylase--the main enzyme in dopamine synthesis--was measured in striatum, zona inserta supraoptic and arcuate nuclea of hypothalamus in fish (Acipenceridae) and in mammals (rats) in ontogenesis (14-, 30-day old rats and adult animals) under tactile and sleep deprivation stresses. The thyrosine-hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells were revealed in all brain regions of fishes after a short-term stress. In the group after longtime stress, the thyrosine-hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells and fibers were almost absent in anterior brain but were found in hypothalamic nuclea. At 14-day old rats, 2-hour sleep deprivation caused increasing of thyrosine-hydroxylase-immunoreactivity both in fibers of caudate nucleus as well as in cells of the zona inserta. A 6-hour deprivation caused increasing of thyrosine-hydroxylase-immunoreactive material level in cells of zona inserta and decreasing it in fibers of 30-day old rats. In adult rats, the level of thyrosine-hydroxylase-immunoreactive material decreased in nucleus arcuatus and zona inserta after sleep deprivation and increased after sleep. Data obtained are discussed in terms ofphylo- and ontogenetic development of neurosecretory and neurotransmitter functions of dopaminergic system in evolutionary old diencephalic and evolutionary young telencephalic brain regions of vertebrates, which are the important systems of starting and maintenance of some functional conditions of the organism in sleep-wakefulness cycle.",1

"Behavioral states alternate between wakefulness (wk), rapid eye movement (rem) and non-rem (nrem) sleep at time scale of hours i.e., light and dark cycle rhythms and from several tens of minutes to seconds (i.e., brief awakenings during sleep). Using statistical analysis of bout duration, Markov chains of sleep-wk dynamics and quantitative EEG analysis, we evaluated the influence of light/dark (ld) changes on brain function along the sleep-wk cycle. Bout duration (bd) histograms and Kaplan-Meier (km) survival curves of wk showed a bimodal statistical distribution, suggesting that two types of wk do exist: brief-wk (wkb) and long-wk (wkl). Light changes modulated specifically wkl bouts, increasing its duration during active/dark period. In contrast, wkb, nrem and rem bd histograms and km curves did not change significantly along ld cycle. Hippocampal eeg of both types of wk were different: in comparison wkb showed a lower spectral power in fast gamma and fast theta bands and less emg tone. After fitting a four-states Markov chain to mice hypnograms, moreover in states transition probabilities matrix was found that: in dark/active period, state-maintenance probability of wkl increased, and probability of wkl to nrem transition decreased; the opposite was found in light period, favoring the hypothesis of the participation of brief wk into nrem-rem intrinsic sleep cycle, and the role of wkl in SWS homeostasis. In conclusion, we propose an extended Markov model of sleep using four stages (wkl, nrem, rem, wkb) as a fully adequate model accounting for both modulation of sleep-wake dynamics based on the differential regulation of long-wk (high gamma/theta) epochs during dark and light phases.",1
"The role of orexin in the organization of sleep-wakefulness cycle (SWC) is well known. The aim of this study was to examine the terms of formation of the orexinergic system in the rat postnatal ontogenesis and to assess the role of orexin A in SWC organization under normal conditions and after prenatal hypoxia realized on days 14 and 19 of the embryogenesis. SWC was investigated in 30-day-old rats with elect- rodes implanted into the somatosensory and occipital cortex. Immunoreactivity in the orexinergic structures of the lateral hypothalamus was also studied. It was shown that in the control 14-day-old animals the orexinergic structures were at the formation stage whereas in the 30-day-old ones they were already formed as in adults. In the 14-day-old rats prenatal hypoxia evoked retardation of the orexinergic system for- mation terms. In the 30-day-old rats the orexinergic system activity after hypoxia was increased, with hypoxia on day 19 activating this system stronger than hypoxia on day 14 of gestation. These changes were reflected in the SWC formation in the 30-day-old rats as shortening of the slow-wave phase of sleep, increase in the fitful sleep and in the number of transitions from the slow-wave to the fast-wave phase of sleep. The results obtained are discussed in the light of the adaptation-compensatory role of the orexinergic system in the postnatal ontogenesis after prenatal damage affecting the central neural system.",1
"Different behavioral techniques are briefly described for treating the violent patient in a hospital setting. Emphasis is placed on doing a careful assessment of the situation and behavior before attempting a behavioral intervention. It is  also emphasized that all staff members involved be adequately trained, otherwise  the procedures tend to fail. Techniques include strategies for changing the environment, as well as using relaxation procedures, systematic desensitization,  differential reinforcement schedules, token economies, response cost, time out, and social skills training. Multi-component programs are also briefly mentioned.  The paper emphasizes that violent behavior can be greatly reduced if approached in a systematic way, using procedures based on sound research methodology.",0
"The Hypocretin1/OrexinA (Hcrt1/OxA) neuropeptides are found in a group of posterolateral hypothalamus neurons and are involved in sleep-wakefulness cycle regulation. Hcrt1/OxA neurons project widely to brainstem aminergic structures, such as the locus coeruleus (LC), which are involved in maintenance of wakefulness and EEG activation through intense projections to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Moreover, defects of the Hcrt1/OxA system are linked to narcolepsy, a disorder characterized by excessive diurnal hypersomnia and REM state disturbance. We aimed to determine whether Hcrt1/OxA neurons innervate LC neurons (noradrenergic and nonnoradrenergic) that project to the mPFC, thereby sustaining behavioral wakefulness. To assess this, we used retrograde tracing from mPFC injections and either Hcrt1/OxA or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemical labeling in single sections of rat LC. The retrograde tracer Fluorogold (FG) was microinjected into mPFC and, at optimal survival periods, sections through the LC were processed for dual immunolabeling of anti-FG and either anti-Hcrt1/OxA or anti-TH antisera. Many LC neurons projecting to mPFC were nonnoradrenergic. Electron microscopy revealed a prominent localization of Hcrt1/OxA in unmyelinated axons and axon boutons (varicosities and axon terminals) within the LC. Hcrt1/OxA-immunoreactive axon boutons frequently apposed (104/1907) or made asymmetric excitatory-type synapses (60/1907) with FG-immunolabeled dendrites, indicating that Hcrt1/OxA can modulate the activity of LC neurons with cortical projections. Our results show that Hcrt1/OxA hypothalamic neurons likely excite LC neurons that project to the mPFC, and thus activate EEG and facilitate wakefulness. In narcoleptics, who are deficient in Hcrt1/OxA, impairment of this Hcrt1/OxA hypothalamic input to LC might contribute to the appearance of excessive daytime sleepiness.",1

"Objective: To explore the epidemiological characteristics and the risk factors for methamphetamine (MA)-associated psychotic symptoms among MA users in China. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between April, 2012 and October, 2015 among individuals for whom MA was the principal drug of use in a Compulsory  Drug Detoxification Center in Beijing, Guangdong Province. Demographic, drug use  and psychological characteristics were examined using a specifically-designed questionnaire, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Barratt Impulsive Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale and Beck Depression Inventory. Logistic regression was performed to explore the risk factors for MA-associated psychotic symptoms. Results: A total of 1685 participants were included. Participants were predominantly aged 30 or above, unemployed, and were unmarried Han Chinese men, with limited education. The duration of MA use was more than 3 months in 72.3%. 47.8% reported that the dose of MA use was ≥ 0.2 g per occasion of use. 11.5% had used two or more synthetic drugs. The prevalence of MA-associated psychotic symptoms was 17.0% among MA users during periods of abstinence. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that a higher dose (≥0.2 g per time), a longer duration of MA use (>3 months) a history of heroin use and a history of tobacco use were associated with MA-associated psychotic symptoms, with adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 1.96 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.40-2.76), 1.98 (95% CI: 1.33-2.96) and 2.45 (95% CI: 1.67-3.60), 1.78 (95% CI: 1.27-2.49) respectively. MA-associated psychotic symptoms were less common among married/cohabitating than unmarried (OR = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.39-0.81), and unemployed than employed (OR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.47-0.92) individuals. MA users with anxiety and depression symptoms had significantly greater risk for MA-associated psychotic symptoms by 9.70 (6.92-13.59) and 1.90 (1.36-2.65) times respectively. Individuals with higher impulsivity were more likely to have MA-associated psychotic symptoms than those with lower (OR = 2.19; CI:1.50-3.20). Conclusion: MA-associated psychotic symptoms occurred frequently among MA users in China. The efforts that facilitate drug users' attempts to reduce MA use, abstain from poly-drug use, and control associated psychiatric symptoms and impulsivity should be supported because of their potential contribution to MA-associated psychotic symptoms in this population.",0
"The sense of olfaction is often reported to have a special relationship with emotional processing. Memories triggered by olfactory cues often have a very emotional load. On the other hand, basic negative or positive emotional states should be sufficient to cover the most significant functions of the olfactory system including ingestion, hazard avoidance, and social communication. Thus, we  investigated whether different basic emotions can be evoked in healthy people through the sense of olfaction. We asked 119 participants which odor evokes one of the six basic emotions (happiness, disgust, anger, anxiety, sadness, and surprise); another 97 participants were asked about pictures evoking those emotions. The results showed that almost every participant could name an olfactory elicitor for happiness or disgust. Olfactory elicitors of anxiety were  reported less frequently, but they were still reported by three-quarters of the participants. However, for sadness and anger only about half of the participants  reported an olfactory elicitor, whereas significantly more named a visual cue. Olfactory emotion elicitors were mainly related to the classes of culture, plants, and food, and visual emotion elicitors were largely related to humans. This data supports the hypothesis that in the vast majority of people, few differentiated emotions can be elicited through the olfactory channel. These emotions are happiness, disgust, and anxiety.",0
"The present study investigated electrocortical and cardiovascular reactivity during positive and negative emotion, and examined the relation of asymmetric frontal lobe activation to cardiovascular responses. Participants were 30 healthy, right-handed university students (mean age, 23.9; 60% female; 76% Caucasian). Electroencephalographic (EEG), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR) responses were assessed while subjects engaged in laboratory tasks (personally-relevant recall tasks and film clips) designed to elicit happiness or anger. Happiness-inducing tasks evoked more prominent left than right frontal EEG activation, and greater left frontal EEG activation than anger-inducing tasks. However, anger-inducing tasks were, on average, associated with comparable left and right frontal EEG activation. Irrespective of emotional valence, cardiovascular activation was more pronounced during personally-relevant recall tasks than during the viewing of film clips. During anger recall, both greater left frontal EEG response (r=-0.46, P<0.02) and greater right frontal EEG response (r=-0.45, P<0.02) were correlated significantly with increased HR reactivity during the task. In addition, a right lateralized frontal EEG response during anger-inducing tasks was associated with greater concomitant systolic BP (P<0.03) and diastolic BP (P<0.008) reactivity. Exploratory analyses also indicated that men who displayed a left lateralized frontal EEG response during happiness-inducing tasks showed the greatest concomitant systolic BP and HR reactivity (P's<0.03). These findings suggest that asymmetric frontal EEG responses to emotional arousal may elicit different patterns of cardiovascular reactivity in healthy adults.",0
"Orexins (also known as hypocretins) play critical roles in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness states by activating two G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), orexin 1 (OX1R) and orexin 2 receptors (OX2R). In order to understand the differential contribution of both receptors in regulating sleep/wakefulness states we compared the pharmacological effects of a newly developed OX2R antagonist (2-SORA), Compound 1 m (C1 m), with those of a dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA), suvorexant, in C57BL/6J mice. After oral administration in the dark period, both C1m and suvorexant decreased wakefulness time with similar efficacy in a dose-dependent manner. While C1m primarily increased total non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep time without affecting episode durations and with minimal effects on REM sleep, suvorexant increased both total NREM and REM sleep time and episode durations with predominant effects on REM sleep. Fos-immunostaining showed that both compounds affected the activities of arousal-related neurons with different patterns. The number of Fos-IR noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus was lower in the suvorexant group as compared with the control and C1m-treated groups. In contrast, the numbers of Fos-IR neurons in histaminergic neurons in the tuberomamillary nucleus and serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe were reduced to a similar extent in the suvorexant and C1m groups as compared with the vehicle-treated group. Together, these results suggest that an orexin-mediated suppression of REM sleep via potential activation of OX1Rs in the locus coeruleus may possibly contribute to the differential effects on sleep/wakefulness exerted by a DORA as compared to a 2-SORA.",1
"Several neuropeptides, including galanin, orexin, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), urocortin-2, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating protein, and vasoactive intestinal peptide, have been implicated in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness states. In particular, neuropeptides produced in the hypothalamus, including galanin, orexin, and MCH, have been shown to play crucial roles. Galanin is localized to the prepotic area of the hypothalamus and is likely to be involved in the promotion and maintenance of sleep. MCH, which is expressed by neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), seems to be implicated in rapid eye movement sleep regulation. Orexins are also localized in the LHA and have been established as one of the most important factors in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness states. A series of studies have suggested that orexin deficiency causes narcolepsy in humans and other mammalian species, highlighting the roles of this hypothalamic neuropeptide in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. Studies of efferent and afferent systems of orexin-producing neurons have shown that the orexin neuronal system has close interactions with the systems that regulate emotion, energy homeostasis, reward, and arousal. These observations suggest that orexin neurons are involved in sensing the body's external and internal environments and regulate vigilance states accordingly.",1
"Fluctuations in sleep/wake state have been proposed as an important mechanism contributing to the development of oscillatory breathing patterns, including Cheyne-Stokes respiration in patients with heart failure. In order to properly assess the interactions between changes in state and changes in ventilatory parameters, a methodology capable of continuously and reliably detecting state transitions is needed. Traditional fixed-epoch analysis of polysomnographic recordings is not suitable for this purpose. Moreover, visual identification of changes in the dominant electroencephalogram activity at the transition from wakefulness to sleep and vice versa is often very subjective. We have therefore developed a hybrid approach--including both visual scoring and computer-based procedures--for continuous analysis of state transitions from polysomnographic recordings, specifically tailored for fluctuations between wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement-1 and -2 sleep. The overall analysis process comprises three major phases: (1) manual identification of relevant electroencephalogram/electrooculogram features and events, including a sample of unequivocal alpha and theta-delta activity; (2) automatic statistical discrimination of dominant electroencephalogram activity; and (3) state classification (wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement-1 and -2). The latter is carried out by merging information from visual scoring with the output of the discriminator. Validation has been carried out in 16 patients with heart failure during daytime Cheyne-Stokes respiration, using a training and testing set of electroencephalogram polysomnograms. The statistical discriminator correctly classified 99.1 +/- 1.4% and 99.2 +/- 1.1% of unequivocal alpha and theta-delta activity. This approach has therefore the potential to be used to reliably measure the incidence and location of sleep-wake transitions during abnormal breathing patterns, as well as their temporal relationship with major ventilatory events.",1
The study examined the perception of facial expressions of different emotional intensities in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) subtypes. Results showed that  the High Risk Assessment and Checking subtype was more sensitive in perceiving the emotions fear and happiness. This suggests that altered affective processing  may underlie the clinical manifestation of OCD.,0
"This paper reports on evaluation of an initiative to use paramedics as the first-level mental health counsellors of abused women in rural Bangladesh (2003-2004) from the perspective of the abused women who participated in one or more counselling sessions. Thirty in-depth interviews, followed by a survey(n=372), targeted to cover all participants, were conducted in 2006. Overall, the arrangement, management of ethical issues, and skills of paramedics  were rated favourably. Most (89%) abused women (n=372) considered the session useful; one-fourth of these women considered it very useful; and only a few abused women considered the session useless. Usefulness of the session was expressed mostly in terms of relief attained after talking about the issue. Most  (87%) women reported being encouraged to be self-confident. In a context characterized by low self-confidence of women, lack of opportunity to talk about  violence, and absence of professional mental health counselling services, this initiative is sufficiently promising to warrant further testing.",0
"Several research groups have developed automated sleep-wakefulness classifiers for night wrist actigraphic (ACT) data. These classifiers tend to be unbalanced, with a tendency to overestimate the detection of sleep, at the expense of poorer detection of wakefulness. The reason for this is that the measure of success in previous works was the maximization of the overall accuracy, disregarding the balance between sensitivity and specificity. The databases were usually sleep recordings, hence the over-representation of sleep samples. In this work an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), sleep-wakefulness classifier is presented. ACT data was collected every minute. An 11-min moving window was used as observing frame for data analysis, as applied in previous sleep ACT studies. However, our feature set adds new variables such as the time of the day, the median and the median absolute deviation. Sleep and Wakefulness data were balanced to improve the system training. A comparison with previous studies can still be done, by choosing the point in the ROC curve associated with the corresponding data balance. Our results are compared with a polysomnogram-based hypnogram as golden standard, rendering an accuracy of 92.8%, a sensitivity of 97.6% and a specificity of 73.4%. Geometric mean between sensitivity and specificity is 84.9%.",1
"Novel findings on the effects of inflammatory molecules on neuronal circuits, and on molecular interactions between immunity and sleep, in health and disease, shed light on the pathogenesis of disorders of past (encephalitis lethargica) and present concern (human African trypanosomiasis and narcolepsy), which share alterations in sleep-wakefulness transitions. Although these three disorders differ in etiology, synaptic interactions with immune-response-derived molecules could play a pathogenetic role. Knowledge obtained on neural-immune interplay during senescence also has implications for age-related sleep dysregulation, which is common in the elderly population. Altogether, the data indicate that cell groups implicated in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness, circadian timing, and their interactions could be sensitive to synaptic effects of immune molecules.",1
"Hypocretins or orexins (Hcrt/Orx) are hypothalamic neuropeptides that are synthesized by neurons located mainly in the perifornical area of the posterolateral hypothalamus. These hypothalamic neurons are the origin of an extensive and divergent projection system innervating numerous structures of the central nervous system. In recent years it has become clear that these neuropeptides are involved in the regulation of many organic functions, such as feeding, thermoregulation and neuroendocrine and cardiovascular control, as well as in the control of the sleep-wakefulness cycle. In this respect, Hcrt/Orx activate two subtypes of G protein-coupled receptors (Hcrt/Orx1R and Hcrt/Orx2R) that show a partly segregated and prominent distribution in neural structures involved in sleep-wakefulness regulation. Wakefulness-enhancing and/or sleep-suppressing actions of Hcrt/Orx have been reported in specific areas of the brainstem. Moreover, presently there are animal models of human narcolepsy consisting in modifications of Hcrt/Orx receptors or absence of these peptides. This strongly suggests that narcolepsy is the direct consequence of a hypofunction of the Hcrt/Orx system, which is most likely due to Hcrt/Orx neurons degeneration.The main focus of this review is to update and illustrate the available data on the actions of Hcrt/Orx neuropeptides with special interest in their participation in the control of the sleep-wakefulness cycle and the regulation of energy homeostasis. Current pharmacological treatment of narcolepsy is also discussed.",1
"Because active treatment is indicated as a patient care priority by both staff and regulatory agencies, innovative ways to utilize available staff to provide treatment needs to be further developed. The Logansport Hospital program provides one example for training experienced attendants in conducting exercise, relaxation, and discussion groups. It has enabled increased programming for patients and has been positively evaluated by our staff.",0
"Gaboxadol or 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo-[5,4-c]pyridine-3-ol (THIP) is a selective agonist for the delta-subunit containing extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors that will soon enter the U.S. market as a sleep aid [Winsky-Sommerer R, Vyazovskiy VV, Homanics GE, Tobler I (2007) The EEG effects of THIP (gaboxadol) on sleep and waking are mediated by the GABA(A)delta-subunit-containing receptors. Eur J Neurosci 25:1893-1899]. Numerous studies have shown that systemic administration of THIP reduces wakefulness and increases sleep both in humans and rats [Lancel M, Langebartels A (2000) Gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[4,5-c]pyridin-3-ol persistently increases sleep maintenance and intensity during chronic administration to rats. J Pharmacol Exp Ther 293:1084-1090; Walsh JK, Deacon S, Dijk DJ, Lundahl J (2007) The selective extrasynaptic GABAA agonist, gaboxadol, improves traditional hypnotic efficacy measures and enhances slow wave activity in a model of transient insomnia. Sleep 30:593-602]. However, it is yet unclear where in the brain THIP acts to promote sleep. Since the perifornical lateral hypothalamus (PFH) contains orexin neurons and orexin neurons are critical for maintenance of arousal [McCarley RW (2007) Neurobiology of rapid eye movement (REM) and NREM sleep. Sleep Med 8:302-330], we hypothesized that THIP may act on PFH neurons to promote sleep. To test our hypothesis, we used reverse microdialysis to perfuse THIP unilaterally into the PFH and studied its effects on sleep-wakefulness during the light period in freely behaving rats. Microdialysis perfusion of THIP (100 microM) into the PFH produced a significant reduction in wakefulness with a concomitant increase in non-rapid eye movement or slow wave sleep as compared with artificial cerebrospinal fluid perfusion. REM sleep was unaffected. This is the first study implicating the delta-subunit containing extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors in PFH in control of sleep-wakefulness in freely behaving rats.",1
"OBJECTIVES: The objective of the research was to assess patient preference for a  selective pressure impression technique for complete dentures by means of a Randomised Controlled Clinical Trial (RCT). METHODS: A literature review revealed no reported RCT's of selective pressure impressions for complete dentures. A cross-over, randomised, controlled, clinical trial was performed comparing selective pressure impressions with a placebo and an alternative method of re-distributing pressure. A sample size calculation yielded 65 patients. Sixty-nine patients, who had a superficial mental foramen on the lower denture bearing area, were recruited for the study. The primary outcome was the patients' preference of the dentures provided. The hypothesis under investigation was that one of the dentures would be preferred by the patients. RESULTS: Sixty-six participants completed the trial, 33 (50%) preferred the denture from the selective pressure impression, 19 (29%) the denture with traditional pressure relief, and 14 (21%) the placebo control. 95% confidence intervals showed that the preference for the selective pressure impression was greater than that of the other two techniques. The null hypothesis was rejected. CONCLUSIONS: The participants in this trial showed a preference for the denture constructed from the selective pressure impression technique, providing dentists  with useful evidence for a clinical impression technique.",0
"This study examines the need for, and outcomes of, a psychotherapeutic skills training programme, within an acute psychogeriatric unit. Nursing staff were surveyed to explore their training needs in psychotherapeutic skills with inpatients diagnosed with depressive, anxiety, or neurocognitive disorders. Staff were then invited to participate in a focus group (n = 6) to identify content of  such training, possible barriers, and an implementation strategy. Next, to ascertain the feasibility and acceptability of such training, materials and schedules were developed and piloted with a small group of nurses (n = 8), before being administered to nurses across the unit (n = 23). Impacts of training on the confidence and competence of nurses to use such skills were investigated. Of nurses surveyed (n = 20), 80% wanted to use psychotherapeutic skills in routine practice, but only 35% had received training in such skills in the last 5 years.  Focus group results identified that nurses wanted training in skills related to engaging patients, responding to resistance from patients, problem solving, reminiscence, relaxation, and cognitive behaviour therapy. Nurses who underwent the pilot training reported increases in confidence and competence in using such  skills. These findings were replicated in the unit-wide training programme and were found to be durable across a 3-month follow-up period. This study highlighted the training needs of nurses working in an inpatient psychogeriatric  setting, approaches to implementing new skills, and benefits of training for nurses' levels of confidence and competence in using psychotherapeutic skills.",0
"BACKGROUND: Hammock positioning is now frequently used with preterm infants admitted to ICUs. However, few studies have investigated the extent to which hammock positioning reduces pain and improves the sleep-wakefulness state compared with traditional positioning. METHODS: Twenty-six clinically stable newborns with gestational ages from 30 to 37 weeks who were breathing spontaneously were randomly assigned to 2 groups: a hammock-positioning group (n = 13), in which newborns were placed in hammocks in the lateral position, and a traditional-positioning group (n = 13), in which they were kept nested, also in the lateral position. The following variables were evaluated at the beginning and the end of the treatment: pain (with the Premature Infant Pain Profile, and Neonatal Facial Coding System), sleep-wakefulness state (with the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale), heart rate, breathing frequency, and peripheral SpO2 . RESULTS: The subjects in the hammock-positioning group showed an improvement in pain compared with the traditional-positioning group(Premature Infant Pain Profile score, 2.62 +/- 1.89 vs 2.31 +/- 1.97, DeltaP = .008) and sleep-wakefulness state score (2.08 +/- 0.64 vs 1.23 +/- 0.44, Delta P < .001), reduced heart rate (151.69 +/- 5.44 vs 142.77 +/- 5.18 beats/min, Delta P < .001), breathing frequency (52.31 +/- 4.05 vs 50.23 +/- 2.55 beats/min, Delta P = .024), and increased peripheral SpO2 (94.69 +/- 2.14 vs 98.00 +/- 1.22%, Delta P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Hammock positioning was an effective treatment option to reduce pain and improve sleep-wakefulness state. It also helped to reduce heart rate and breathing frequency, and to increase peripheral SpO2 , which made it a treatment option for preterm infants.",1
"Many aspects of brain function are influenced by modulatory processes, including arousal. The most abrupt changes in arousal occur at the wake-sleep transition and at the induction of anesthetic conditions. They are accompanied by major electrophysiological changes, including an emergence of low-frequency (sleep-like) activity and a loss of mid-frequency (wake-like) activity that has been linked to feedback processes of the brain. Nevertheless, the causal relationship between these two types of electrophysiological changes, as well as the cortical mechanisms underlying changes in arousal and consciousness, remain poorly understood. To address this, we studied spontaneous electro-cortical activity during arousal changes in macaques. During sleep and at loss of consciousness induced by propofol anesthesia, we identified a prototypical sequence of cortical events in which the loss of mid-frequency activity preceded, by seconds, the increases in low-frequency activity. Furthermore, in visual areas, an influence of mid-frequency change onto high-frequency activity was observed across visual hierarchy. These results are consistent with the notion that drops in arousal and consciousness are facilitated by a release of feedback cortical inhibition.",1
"The purpose of the present work was to study the effects of tolerance to ethanol on the sleep-wakefulness cycle (SWC) structure. Experiments were carried out in chronic conditions on the adult cats (n=5). The following methods were used: the stereotaxic - for implanting electrodes; polysomnographic - for EEG registration of the SWC structure. Alcoholisation (0.2-2.5 g/kg 25% ethanol solution) was conducted by intraperitoneal injections that lasted for two weeks. The obtained results were processed statistically and significance of the changes was determined by the Student t-test. Low single doses of ethanol (0.2 - 0.5 g/kg) did not induce any significant changes in the structure of the SWC. While using doses of 0.6 g/kg it was noted only increasing of the latent period of the onset of sleep. However, the structure of the SWC recovered within 1-2 hours after injection. Increasing the dose to 1 g/kg caused severe intoxication. This was reflected in a behavioral (anxiety, tremor, vocalizations) and autonomic (vomiting and frequent urination) signs. Against the background of restless behavioral wakefulness synchronization of the characteristic of light slow-wave sleep developed. The volume of deep slow-wave sleep was statistically significantly decreased and the latent period of the onset of paradoxical sleep was increased. The structure of sleep was fragmented, due to frequent awakenings. For the fifth-eighth day of alcoholization the structure of the SWC restored, behavioral and vegetative signs of intoxication disappeared, which must indicate the development of tolerance to this dose of ethanol. The obtained results signify that development of tolerance to ethanol can be reflected in the alteration of the structure of SWC. Alcoholization disturbs the subtle mechanisms of the sleep due to destruction of brain homeostasis.",1
"The possession of a rhythm is usually described as an important adaptation to regular changing environmental conditions such as the light-dark cycle. However, recent studies have suggested plasticity in the expression of a rhythm depending on life history and environmental factors. Barn owl ( Tyto alba) nestlings show variations in behavior and physiology in relation to the size of black feather spots, a trait associated with many behavioral and physiological phenotypes including the circadian expression of corticosterone and the regulation of body mass. This raises the possibility that individual spottiness could be associated with rhythmicity in sleep-wakefulness. Owlets showed ultradian rhythms in sleep-wakefulness, with a period length of 4.5 to 4.9 h. The period length of wakefulness and non-REM sleep was shorter in heavily compared to lightly spotted female nestlings, whereas in males, the opposite result was found. Furthermore, male and female nestlings displaying small black spots showed strong rhythmicity levels in wakefulness and REM sleep. This might be an advantage in a stable environment with predictable periodic changes in light, temperature, or social interactions. Heavily spotted nestlings displayed weak rhythms in wakefulness and REM sleep, which might enable them to be more flexible in reactions to unexpected events such as predation or might be a mechanism to save energy. These findings are consistent with previous findings showing that large-spotted nestlings switch more frequently between wakefulness and sleep, resulting in higher levels of vigilance compared to small-spotted conspecifics. Thus, nestlings with larger black feather spots might differently handle the trade-off between wakefulness and sleep, attention, and social interactions compared to nestlings with smaller black spots.",1
"The perifornical area in the posterior lateral hypothalamus (PeFLH) has been implicated in several physiological functions including the sleep-wakefulness regulation. The PeFLH area contains several cell types including those expressing orexins (Orx; also known as hypocretins), mainly located in the PeF nucleus. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the synaptic interactions between Orx neurons located in the PeFLH area and different brainstem neurons involved in the generation of wakefulness and sleep stages such as the locus coeruleus (LC) nucleus (contributing to wakefulness) and the oral pontine reticular nucleus (PnO) nucleus (contributing to REM sleep). Anatomical data demonstrated the existence of a neuronal network involving the PeFLH area, LC, and the PnO nuclei that would control the sleep-wake cycle. Electrophysiological experiments indicated that PeFLH area had an excitatory effect on LC neurons. PeFLH stimulation increased the firing rate of LC neurons and induced an activation of the EEG. The excitatory effect evoked by PeFLH stimulation in LC neurons was blocked by the injection of the Orx-1 receptor antagonist SB-334867 into the LC. Similar electrical stimulation of the PeFLH area evoked an inhibition of PnO neurons by activation of GABAergic receptors because the effect was blocked by bicuculline application into the PnO. Our data also revealed that the LC and PnO nuclei exerted a feedback control on neuronal activity of PeFLH area. Electrical stimulation of LC facilitated firing activity of PeFLH neurons by activation of catecholaminergic receptors whereas PnO stimulation inhibited PeFLH neurons by activation of GABAergic receptors. In conclusion, Orx neurons of the PeFLH area seem to be an important organizer of the wakefulness and sleep stages in order to maintain a normal succession of stages during the sleep-wakefulness cycle.",1
"The work was aimed for the ascertainment of following question - whether Orexin-containing neurons of dorsal and lateral hypothalamic, and brain Orexinergic system in general, are those cellular targets which can speed up recovery of disturbed sleep homeostasis and accelerate restoration of sleep-wakefulness cycle phases during some pathological conditions - experimental comatose state and/or deep anesthesia-induced sleep. Study was carried out on white rats. Modeling of experimental comatose state was made by midbrain cytotoxic lesions at intra-collicular level.Animals were under artificial respiration and special care. Different doses of Sodium Ethaminal were used for deep anesthesia. 30 min after comatose state and/or deep anesthesia induced sleep serial electrical stimulations of posterior and/or perifornical hypothalamus were started. Stimulation period lasted for 1 hour with the 5 min intervals between subsequent stimulations applied by turn to the left and right side hypothalamic parts.EEG registration of cortical and hippocampal electrical activity was started immediately after experimental comatose state and deep anesthesia induced sleep and continued continuously during 72 hour. According to obtained new evidences, serial electrical stimulations of posterior and perifornical hypothalamic Orexin-containing neurons significantly accelerate recovery of sleep homeostasis, disturbed because of comatose state and/or deep anesthesia induced sleep. Speed up recovery of sleep homeostasis was manifested in acceleration of coming out from comatose state and deep anesthesia induced sleep and significant early restoration of sleep-wakefulness cycle behavioral states.",1
"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The incidence of cardiovascular events is related to the sleep-wakefulness cycle. In particular, the magnitude and speed of the changes in hemodynamic variables that occur during transitions between wakefulness and sleep and between sleep and wakefulness are regarded as factors that either predict or determine target organ damage and cardiovascular risk. Although increased arterial stiffness (AS) is associated with the development of cardiovascular abnormalities, it is not known whether there exist any changes in AS that are associated with circadian variations in the incidence of cardiovascular events. The aims of this study were to assess AS in healthy subjects over a 24-hour period, to characterize any differences that occur between sleep and wakefulness, and to investigate any changes in AS that occur during the transition from wakefulness to sleep or from sleep to wakefulness. METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers with a dipper circadian blood pressure pattern underwent 24-hour ambulatory monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate and AS. In practice, AS was determined using the aorta-brachial pulse transit time and fractional pulsatility indices. Myocardial oxygen consumption was quantified using the double product (DP). An average was calculated for all variables for periods of sleep (23:00 to 06:00) and wakefulness (8:00 to 21:00) and for transitions from wakefulness to sleep (20:00 vs. 02:00) and from sleep to wakefulness (06:00 vs. 10:00 hours). RESULTS: In complete contrast to DP, AS was greater during sleep than wakefulness (P< .05). Moreover, the changes in AS that occurred during transitions from wakefulness to sleep and from sleep to wakefulness were the opposite of those observed in DP (P< .05). CONCLUSIONS: Arterial stiffness was greater during sleep than wakefulness, increased during the transition from wakefulness to sleep, and decreased during the transition from sleep to wakefulness.",1
"Since nurses are constantly bombarded by stress, you would expect many documented interventions to help them deal with it. But such interventions are hard to find.

"This study assessed whether presenting 3D face stimuli could facilitate children's facial expression recognition. Seventy-one children aged between 3 and 6 participated in the study. Their task was to judge whether a face presented in  each trial showed a happy or fearful expression. Half of the face stimuli were shown with 3D representations, whereas the other half of the images were shown as 2D pictures. We compared expression recognition under these conditions. The results showed that the use of 3D faces improved the speed of facial expression recognition in both boys and girls. Moreover, 3D faces improved boys' recognition accuracy for fearful expressions. Since fear is the most difficult facial expression for children to recognize, the facilitation effect of 3D faces has important practical implications for children with difficulties in facial expression recognition. The potential benefits of 3D representation for other expressions also have implications for developing more realistic assessments of children's expression recognition.",0
"BACKGROUND:: Evidence whether individuals with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk for traffic violations/collisions is mixed. This study investigated the association between ADHD and traffic violations among youth and young adults; examined whether this association differed by age, sex, or comorbid mental or physical problems; and modelled factors associated with traffic violations among individuals with ADHD. METHODS:: Data come from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health  (CCHS-MH), a cross-sectional epidemiological study. The sample was restricted to  youth and young adults aged 15 to 39 years and categorized into 3 groups: 15 to 19 years ( n = 1886), 20 to 29 years ( n = 3679), and 30 to 39 years ( n = 3659). Lifetime ADHD and past-year contact with police for traffic violations were self-reported. Logistic regression models quantified the association between ADHD and traffic violations, stratified by age. Interactions were included to examine  moderating effects. RESULTS:: No evidence suggested an association between ADHD and past-year traffic violations (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.64 to 1.79), age-specific estimates did not differ across age groups ( P = 0.696), and no factors moderated the association. Three factors were found to increase odds for  past-year traffic violations among individuals with ADHD: aged 20 to 29 years (OR, 3.84; 95% CI, 1.47 to 10.06), male sex (OR, 3.48; 95% CI, 1.39 to 8.59), and white ethnicity (OR, 5.62; 95% CI, 1.24 to 25.51). CONCLUSIONS:: Individuals with ADHD are not an at-risk group for traffic violations but instead share similar risk factors with individuals in the general population without ADHD-information useful for health professionals. Replication  studies are needed to examine the robustness of these findings.",0
"Sleep is a necessary, diverse, periodic, and an active condition circadian and homeostatically regulated and precisely meshed with waking time into the sleep-wakefulness cycle (SWC). Photic retinal stimulation modulates the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which acts as the pacemaker for SWC rhythmicity. Both the light period and social cues adjust the internal clock, making the SWC a circadian, 24-h period in the adult human. Bioelectrical and behavioral parameters characterize the different phases of the SWC. For a long time, lesions and electrical stimulation of brain structures, as well as connection studies, were the main methods used to decipher the foundations of the functional anatomy of the SWC. That is why the first section of this review presents these early historical studies to then discuss the current state of our knowledge based on our understanding of the functional anatomy of the structures underlying the SWC. Supported by this description, we then present a detailed review and update of the structures involved in the phase of wakefulness (W), including their morphological, functional, and chemical characteristics, as well as their anatomical connections. The structures for W generation are known as the ""ascending reticular activating system"", and they keep and maintain the ""thalamo-cerebral cortex unit"" awake. This system originates from the neuronal groups located within the brainstem, hypothalamus, and basal forebrain, which use known neurotransmitters and whose neurons are more active during W than during the other SWC states. Thus, synergies among several of these neurotransmitters are necessary to generate the cortical and thalamic activation that is characteristic of the W state, with all the plastic qualities and nuances present in its different behavioral circumstances. Each one of the neurotransmitters exerts powerful influences on the information and cognitive processes as well as attentional, emotional, motivational, behavioral, and arousal states. The awake ""thalamo-cerebral cortex unit"" controls and adjusts the activation pattern through a top-down action on the subcortical cellular groups that are the origin of the ""ascending reticular activating system"".",1
"In three studies, we explored how the ending of a life influences the perceived desirability of that life. We consistently observed that participants neglected duration in judging the global quality of life. Across all the studies, the end of life was weighted heavily, producing ratings that contradict a simple hedonic  calculus in which years of pleasure and pain are summed. Respondents rated a wonderful life that ended abruptly as better than one with additional mildly pleasant years (the ""James Dean Effect""). Similarly, a terrible life with additional moderately bad years was rated as more desirable than one ending abruptly without those unpleasant years (the ""Alexander Solzhenitsyn Effect""). Finally, embedding moderately intense years in the middle of life did not produce effects as strong as adding those years to the end of life, suggesting that a life's ending is weighted especially heavily in judging quality of life.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Weight loss maintenance is one of the biggest challenges in behavioral weight loss programs. The present study aimed to examine metabolic influences on  the mesolimbic reward system in people with successful and unsuccessful long-term weight loss maintenance. METHODS: Thirty-three women with obesity at least 6 months after the completion of a diet were recruited: seventeen women were able to maintain their weight loss, whereas sixteen showed weight regain. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging in combination with the assessment of appetite-regulating hormones, neural reward processing during hunger and satiety was investigated. An incentive delay task was employed to investigate the expectation and receipt of both food-related and monetary reward. RESULTS: Only participants with successful weight loss maintenance showed a satiety-induced attenuation of brain activation during the receipt of a food-related reward. Furthermore, in successful weight loss maintenance, the attenuation of active ghrelin levels was related to brain activation in response  to food-related reward anticipation during satiety. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that an attenuated influence of satiety signaling on the neural processing of food-related reward contributes to unsuccessful weight loss maintenance. Thus, intact satiety signaling to the mesolimbic reward system may serve as a promising target for tackling weight cycling.",0
"Student nurses maintain unfavorable views of people with mental health issues. Many continue to perpetuate common stereotypes, are fearful and believe people with mental health problems are in some way dangerous. The impact of placements greatly affects these views. A pre-post survey of 85 student nurses was conducted to establish the opinions and attitudes of student nurses regarding mental health. Groups were allocated to either community or hospital placements. Each group received the same educational preparation prior to placement. Both community and hospital placed students had improved clinical confidence when working with people experiencing mental health problems. Community placed students demonstrated greater positive attitudes towards people experiencing mental health issues across a number of domains. Students in hospital settings demonstrated more confidence when working with people with mental health issues yet had less attitudinal change about mental health. The approach taken by clinical facilitators also influenced student attitudes. It is suggested that offering community opportunities along with exposure to positive instructor beliefs about mental illness will both improve student attitudes prior to the completion of their nursing studies and may encourage entry into mental health as a nursing option post-education.",0

"Subjects (""senders"") encoded six emotions twice, first via facial expressions and second via tone of voice. These expressions were recorded and presented for decoding to the senders and an additional group of judges. Results were as follows: (a) the ability to encode and the ability to decode both visual and auditory cues were significantly related; (b) the relationship between encoding and decoding cues of the same emotion appeared low or negative; (c) the ability to decode visual cues was significantly related to the ability to decode auditory cues, but the correlations among encoding (and decoding) scores on different emotions were low; (d) females were slightly better encoders, and significantly better decoders, than males; (e) acquaintance between sender and judge improved decoding scores among males but not among females; (f) auditory decoding scores were higher than visual decoding scores, particularly among males; (g) auditory decoding scores were relatively high if sender and judge were of the same sex, while visual decoding scores were relatively high if sender and judge were of opposite sexes; (h) decoding scores varied according to channel of communication  and type of emotion transmitted.",0
"Hypocretinergic/orexinergic neurons, which are known to be implicated in narcolepsy, project to the pontine tegmentum areas involved in the control of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Here, we report the effects on sleep-wakefulness produced by low-volume microinjections of hypocretin (Hcrt)1 (20-30 nL, 100, 500 and 1000 microm) and carbachol (20-30 nL, 0.1 m) delivered in two areas of the oral pontine tegmentum of free-moving cats with electrodes for chronic sleep recordings: in the dorsal oral pontine tegmentum (DOPT) and in the ventral part of the oral pontine reticular nucleus (vRPO). Carbachol in the DOPT produced dissociate polygraphic states, with some but not all REM sleep signs. In contrast, carbachol in the vRPO produced a shift with short latency from wakefulness (W) to REM sleep with all of its polygraphic and behavioral signs. Hcrt-1 in the DOPT increased W and decreased both slow-wave sleep (SWS) and REM sleep during the first 3 h post-drug. The same doses of Hcr-1 in the vRPO produced a significant suppression of REM sleep without a definitive trend for changes in the other states. Both groups showed significant decreases in the number of transitions from SWS to REM sleep. Thus, Hcrt-1 produced distinct effects in cholinoceptive areas of the oral pontine tegmentum; in the DOPT it promoted W, suppressed SWS and probably defacilitated REM sleep, and in the vRPO it directly inhibited REM sleep. Hypocretinergic/orexinergic signaling is lost in narcoleptics and this absence would mean that pontine defacilitation/inhibition of REM sleep would also be absent, explaining why these patients can fall directly into REM sleep from W.",1
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of mental practice on motor imagery ability and assess the influence of motor imagery on gait rehabilitation in sub-acute stroke. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SUBJECTS: A total of 44 patients with gait dysfunction after first-ever stroke were randomly allocated to a motor imagery training group and a muscle relaxation group. METHODS: The motor imagery group received 6 weeks of daily mental practice. The relaxation group received a muscle relaxation programme of equal duration. Motor  imagery ability and lower limb function were assessed at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment. Motor imagery ability was tested using a questionnaire and mental chronometry test. Gait outcome was evaluated using a 10-m walk test (near  transfer) and the Fugl-Meyer assessment (far transfer). RESULTS: Significant between-group differences were found, with the vividness of  kinesthetic imagery and the walking test results improving more in the motor imagery group than in the muscle relaxation group. There was no group interaction effect for the far transfer outcome score. CONCLUSION: Motor imagery training may have a beneficial task-specific effect on  gait function in sub-acute stroke; however, longer term confirmation is required.",0
"QUESTIONS: Is mental practice embedded in standard physiotherapy compared with relaxation embedded in standard physiotherapy more effective at improving mobility tasks in people with Parkinson's disease in the community? Does disease  severity influence the treatment effect? DESIGN: A multicentre randomised controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: People with Parkinson's disease. INTERVENTION: During a six-week intervention period, both groups received physiotherapy as usual with the addition of either mental practice (experimental  group) or relaxation (control group). Imagery skills were taught using a four-step protocol. Movement imagery (in thought) and the performance of motor activities were combined. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were assessed at six weeks and three months with: the  patient- and therapist-perceived effect on walking performance (visual analogue scale), the Timed Up and Go test, and the 10 m Walk test. Primary analysis was performed using intention-totreat and was repeated as a per-protocol analysis, and as a sub-group analysis of participants with Hoehn and Yahr stage of less than 3. Generalised estimating equations were used to analyse effects. RESULTS: 47 participants were assigned to the control (n = 22) and experimental (n = 25) groups. No effect in favour of the mental practice intervention on any outcome measure could be detected at any of the measurement points. In the sub-group analysis of participants with milder disease, the experimental group improved more than the control group but this was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: In this study, we did not find differences between embedded mental practice and relaxation with current standard of care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Nederlands Trial Register: NTR1735.",0
"OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to explore the mediating role of family-related determinants on the effects of the ToyBox-intervention on pre-school children's consumption of healthy and unhealthy snacks. DESIGN: The ToyBox-intervention was a kindergarten-based, family-involved intervention with a cluster-randomized design, aiming to promote healthy lifestyle behaviours to prevent obesity at pre-school age. SETTING: Kindergartens (n 309) in six European countries. SUBJECTS: A total of 6290 pre-schoolers and their families participated in the ToyBox-intervention in 2012-2013 and data from 5212 pre-schoolers/families were included in the current analyses. RESULTS: Even though the total effect of the ToyBox-intervention on healthy and unhealthy snacking was not significant, the ToyBox-intervention significantly improved parental rule setting on children's unhealthy snack consumption (i.e. restriction of snacking while watching television and permission only at certain  occasions) and parental consumption of unhealthy snacks, while it increased parental knowledge on snacking recommendations. Regarding healthy snacking, the ToyBox-intervention improved children's attitude towards fruit and vegetables (F&amp;V). All previously mentioned family-related determinants mediated the intervention effects on pre-schoolers' consumption of healthy and unhealthy snacks. Almost all family-related determinants examined in the study were independently associated with pre-schoolers' consumption of healthy and unhealthy snacks. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was effective in improving relevant family-related  determinants. Interventions aiming to promote F&amp;V consumption and limit the consumption of unhealthy snacks in pre-schoolers should target on these mediators, but also identify new family-, school- or peer-related determinants, to enhance their effectiveness.",0
"BACKGROUND: Receiving a diagnosis of cancer may be associated with increased risk of mental disorders. Yet, in this context, no factor predicts the onset of a mental disorder besides the diagnosis of cancer itself. If patients with a history of mental disorder are at particular risk is unknown. METHODS: Data were derived from a large national sample of the US population. Face-to-face surveys were conducted on 36309 adults during 2012-2013 period. Data were used to examine the associations among the past-year prevalence of mental disorders (according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5), the treatment-seeking rates and a recent cancer diagnosis. Data were analysed according to the antecedents of mental disorder in participants and according the presence of a recent cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: Participants recently diagnosed with cancer (n = 1300) were significantly at higher risk to present suicide attempt (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23-10.04), post-traumatic stress disorder (AOR = 2.25; 95% CI = 1.71-2.96), bipolar disorder (AOR = 2.22; 95% CI = 1.46-3.38) and drug use disorder (AOR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.13-3.39). The prevalence of most of the mental disorders considered was significantly higher for participants with a history of mental disorder compared with participants without such a history. Conversely, a recent diagnosis of cancer was not associated with significant differences in the incidence of mental disorders in participants with no history of mental disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a history of mental disorder receiving a cancer diagnosis are at high risk of relapse and should be closely monitored.",0
"BACKGROUND: This study examines the effects and associated factors of respite care, which was legislated as a community service for adults with an intellectual disability (ID) in Taiwan in 1997. METHOD: A total of 116 family carers who live with an adult with ID and have utilised the respite care program were surveyed using standardised measures. RESULTS: The results suggest that the most notable effects of respite care include improvement in the carers' social support and life satisfaction, and relief of psychological stress and overall burden of care. The factors associated with these effects include the way the participants have used the respite care and the users' individual characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: How families used the respite care, whether the carers practised a religion, and where the families resided, were the most significant factors in determining the effectiveness of the respite. Suggestions are made for making access to information about the program more widely available, and for extending  the availability and duration of the service.",0
"Seizures can evolve sequentially into different clinical phases. For example, a seizure may start as an aura (first phase), then evolve into a tonic seizure (second phase), and evolve further into a generalized tonic-clonic semiology (third phase). It is currently unknown whether specific seizure evolutions cluster at particular times of the day and/or during sleep/wakefulness. We aimed to describe the distribution of the clinical evolution of seizures across time of day and sleep/wake state. We included all patients with at least two seizure phases admitted for long-term electroencephalogram monitoring during a 5 year period. Two-hundred-and-fifteen patients (866 seizures) presented with two different phases and 87 patients (324 seizures) evolved into a third clinical phase. During phase two, evolution into clonic seizures differed across time (p = 0.047) with peaks at 0-3 h and 6-9 h and during sleep (p < 0.001), evolution into automotor seizures peaked during wakefulness (p = 0.015), evolution into tonic seizures differed across time (p = 0.005) with peaks at 21-12 h and during sleep (p = 0.0119), and generalized tonic-clonic seizures peaked during sleep (p = 0.0067). Findings remained statistically significant after multivariable analysis adjusting, separately, for potential confounders (semiology of the first phase, age, gender, days in the long-term electroencephalographic monitoring unit, abnormal neuroimaging, number of antiepileptic medications, and seizure localization). During phase three, seizure evolutions followed the same pattern of distribution as during phase two but differences did not reach statistical significance. Our data demonstrate that the evolution of seizures into different phases cluster at specific times of day and at specific phases of the sleep/wakefulness cycle.",1
"This social and historical investigation into the ways the health and sickness of mothers from Teixeiras municipality, Minas Gerais state, was represented is designed to comprehend behaviors in this sphere and help develop research in collective health. The semantics and indicators of a pluralistic view of disease  and health, were built up from the most holistic to the most biomedical, from the most relational to the most individual. The quest for happiness was presented as  a health concept by the mothers, which recalls Aristotelian and Spinozian philosophical concepts, but they put greater emphasis on the absence of illness.  The prevailing welfare model still supplies useful references for interpreting such experiences. As the mother's status as care-taker helps one glean an understanding of other factors that affect the process of health and disease, it  becomes possible to plan healthcare initiatives that are less alienating and more libertarian.",0
"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) plays key roles in sleep-wakefulness regulation. Evidence indicates that 5-HT2 receptors are involved mainly in non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) regulation and respiratory control. Here, we investigated the relative contribution of 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2B), and 5-HT(2C) receptor subtypes to NREMS and breathing during sleep, using 5-HT2 subtype-selective ligands in wild-type (5-HT(2A)+/+) and knock-out (5-HT(2A)-/-) mice that do not express 5-HT(2A) receptors. Acute blockade of 5-HT(2A) receptors induced an increase in NREMS in 5-HT(2A)+/+ mice, but not 5-HT(2A)-/- mutants, which spontaneously expressed less NREMS than wild-type animals. In 5-HT(2A)+/+ mice, 5-HT(2B) receptor blockade produced a reduction of NREMS, whereas receptor activation induced an increase in this sleep stage. These effects were less pronounced in 5-HT(2A)-/- mice, indicating a lower sensitivity of 5-HT(2B) receptors in mutants, with no change in 5-HT(2B) mRNA. Blockade of 5-HT(2C) receptors had no effect on NREMS in both strains. In addition, an increase in EEG power density after sleep deprivation was observed in 5-HT(2A)+/+ mice but not in 5-HT(2A)-/- mice. Whole-body plethysmographic recordings indicated that 5-HT(2A) receptor blockade in 5-HT(2A)+/+ mice reduced NREMS apneas and bradypneas that occurred after sighs. In contrast, in 5-HT(2A)-/- mutants, NREMS apneas were not modified, and bradypnea after sighs were more pronounced. Our results demonstrate that 5-HT exerts a 5-HT(2B)-mediated facilitation of NREMS, and an influence respectively inhibitory on NREMS and facilitatory on sleep apnea generation, via 5-HT(2A) receptors. Moreover, 5-HT(2A) gene knock-out leads to functional compensations yielding adaptive changes opposite to those caused by pharmacological blockade of 5-HT(2A) receptors in 5-HT(2A)+/+ mice.",1
"This paper analyzes the meaning of mental illness and institutional care from a family point of view, using family correspondence and police reports about asylum admission of family members in Alberta at the beginning of the 20th century. Portraying the asylum as a place of negotiation, the analysis reveals that despite families' lack of authority over asylum admission, they nevertheless were active participants in structuring this new form of public care once it became available in Alberta. Families negotiated and contested existing medical and legal norms that structured asylum care in order to meet their own needs and demands. Categories of age, class, gender, race, and region intersected in shaping the family experience of mental illness. The paper concludes that families expected a newly built institution to provide relief of their social problems, which was at odds with the legal and medical norms regarding asylum admission.",0
"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a collective term for two conditions: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). A proportion of people with VTE have no underlying or immediately predisposing risk factors and the VTE  is referred to as unprovoked. Unprovoked VTE can often be the first clinical manifestation of an underlying malignancy. This has raised the question of whether people with an unprovoked VTE should be investigated for an underlying cancer. Treatment for VTE is different in cancer and non-cancer patients and a correct diagnosis would ensure that people received the optimal treatment for VTE to prevent recurrence and further morbidity. Furthermore, an appropriate cancer diagnosis at an earlier stage could avoid the risk of cancer progression and lead to improvements in cancer-related mortality and morbidity. This is an update of a review first published in 2015. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether testing for undiagnosed cancer in people with a  first episode of unprovoked VTE (DVT of the lower limb or PE) is effective in reducing cancer or VTE-related mortality and morbidity and to determine which tests for cancer are best at identifying treatable cancers early. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 11 July 2018. We also undertook reference checking to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials in which people with an unprovoked VTE were allocated to receive specific tests for identifying cancer or clinically indicated tests only were eligible for inclusion. Primary outcomes  included all-cause mortality, cancer-related mortality and VTE-related mortality. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies,  assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We resolved any disagreements by discussion. MAIN RESULTS: No new studies were identified for this 2018 update. In total, four studies with 1644 participants are included. Two studies assessed the effect of extensive tests including computed tomography (CT) scanning versus tests at the physician's discretion, while the other two studies assessed the effect of standard testing plus positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scanning versus standard testing alone. For extensive tests including CT versus tests at the physician's discretion, the quality of the evidence, as assessed according to GRADE, was low due to risk of bias (early termination of the studies). When comparing standard testing plus PET/CT scanning versus standard testing alone, the quality of evidence was moderate due to a risk of detection bias. The quality of the evidence was downgraded further as detection bias was present in one study with a low number of events.When comparing extensive tests including CT versus tests at the physician's discretion, pooled analysis on two studies showed that testing for cancer was consistent with either benefit or no benefit on cancer-related mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 1.67; 396 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.26; low-quality evidence). One study  (201 participants) showed that, overall, malignancies were less advanced at diagnosis in extensively tested participants than in participants in the control  group. In total, 9/13 participants diagnosed with cancer in the extensively tested group had a T1 or T2 stage malignancy compared to 2/10 participants diagnosed with cancer in the control group (OR 5.00, 95% CI 1.05 to 23.76; P = 0.04; low-quality evidence). There was no clear difference in detection of advanced stages between extensive tests versus tests at the physician's discretion: one participant in the extensively tested group had stage T3 compared with four participants in the control group (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.28; P = 0.22; low-quality evidence). In addition, extensively tested participants were diagnosed earlier than control group (mean: 1 month with extensive tests versus 11.6 months with tests at physician's discretion to cancer diagnosis from the time of diagnosis of VTE). Extensive testing did not increase the frequency of an underlying cancer diagnosis (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.93; 396 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.50; low-quality evidence). Neither study measured all-cause mortality, VTE-related morbidity and mortality, complications of anticoagulation, adverse effects of cancer tests, participant satisfaction or quality of life.When comparing standard testing plus PET/CT screening versus standard testing alone, standard testing plus PET/CT screening was consistent with either benefit or no benefit on all-cause mortality (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.04; 1248 participants;  2 studies; P = 0.66; moderate-quality evidence), cancer-related mortality (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.52; 1248 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.25; moderate-quality evidence) or VTE-related morbidity (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.17; 854 participants; 1 study; P = 0.96; moderate-quality evidence). Regarding  stage of cancer, there was no clear difference for detection of early (OR 1.78, 95% 0.51 to 6.17; 394 participants; 1 study; P = 0.37; low-quality evidence) or advanced (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.17; 394 participants; 1 study; P = 1.00; low-quality evidence) stages of cancer. There was also no clear difference in the frequency of an underlying cancer diagnosis (OR 1.71, 95% CI 0.91 to 3.20; 1248 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.09; moderate-quality evidence). Time to cancer diagnosis was 4.2 months in the standard testing group and 4.0 months in the standard testing plus PET/CT group (P = 0.88). Neither study measured VTE-related mortality, complications of anticoagulation, adverse effects of cancer tests, participant satisfaction or quality of life. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Specific testing for cancer in people with unprovoked VTE may lead to earlier diagnosis of cancer at an earlier stage of the disease. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions  concerning the effectiveness of testing for undiagnosed cancer in people with a first episode of unprovoked VTE (DVT or PE) in reducing cancer- or VTE-related morbidity and mortality. The results could be consistent with either benefit or no benefit. Further good-quality large-scale randomised controlled trials are required before firm conclusions can be made.",0
"PURPOSE: We conducted a randomized, double-blinded study to test our hypothesis that caudal blockade as preemptive analgesia for low back surgery might accelerate time to walking exercise following surgery and reduce postoperative analgesics, thereby attaining faster recovery of cognitive function. METHODS: Our study included 51 elderly patients >70 years with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1-3, who underwent lumbosacral surgery under general anesthesia. After anesthetic induction and tracheal intubation, patients in the study group (group B) were injected with simple 0.5% bupivacaine  [10 ml x height (m)] as a caudal block 15 min before surgical incision, whereas patients in the control group (group C) received normal saline. After surgery, patients had access to intravenous patient-administered analgesia (IV PCA), fentanyl, for postoperative pain relief. We assessed Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores before and after the surgery, values of visual analog scale (VAS) for postoperative analgesic status, fentanyl consumption during and for 3 days after surgery, and time to begin walking exercise after surgery. RESULTS: VAS value of group B patients was significantly lower than those in group C throughout the postoperative 48-h period (p < 0.005), and group B patients began walking exercise significantly earlier than those in group C [mean +/- standard deviation (SD) 70.2 (14.3) in group C, and 61.9 (7.6) in group B; p  = 0.0133]. Cognitive function level was higher in group B than in group C patients 24 h after operation. CONCLUSIONS: Caudal blockade as preemptive analgesia shortened the time to start  walking exercise after surgery and accelerated recovery of postoperative cognitive function.",0

"The present research comprises six experiments that investigated racial biases in the perception of positive emotional expressions. In an initial study, we demonstrated that White participants distinguished more in their happiness ratings of Duchenne (""true"") and non-Duchenne (""false"") smiles on White compared  with Black faces (Experiment 1). In a subsequent study we replicated this effect  using a different set of stimuli and non-Black participants (Experiment 2). As predicted, this bias was not demonstrated by Black participants, who did not significantly differ in happiness ratings between smile types on White and Black  faces (Experiment 3). Furthermore, in addition to happiness ratings, we demonstrated that non-Black participants were also more accurate when categorizing true versus false expressions on White compared with Black faces (Experiment 4). The final two studies provided evidence for the mediating role of attention to the eyes in intergroup emotion identification. In particular, eye tracking data indicated that White participants spent more time attending to the  eyes of White than Black faces and that attention to the eyes predicted biases in happiness ratings between true and false smiles on White and Black faces (Experiment 5). Furthermore, an experimental manipulation focusing participants on the eyes of targets eliminated the effects of target race or perceptions of happiness (Experiment 6). Together, the findings provide novel evidence for racial biases in the identification of positive emotions and highlight the critical role of visual attention in this process.

"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether perinatal smoking exposure is associated with gastroesophageal reflux (GER)-related changes in sleep-wakefulness states in neonates. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-one neonates, referred for the investigation of suspected GER, were recruited and underwent multichannel impedance-pH monitoring and synchronized 8- to 12-hour polysomnography. The infants' exposure to tobacco smoke was estimated by means of a urine cotinine assay. The total number, frequency (h(-1)), and mean duration (minutes) of GER-pH (reflux events detected by the pH electrode only) and GER-imp (reflux events with bolus movement detected by impedance) events were determined. Intergroup differences (smoking-exposed group vs nonexposed group) were probed with nonparametric, unpaired Mann-Whitney U tests. A chi(2) test was used to assess a possible intergroup difference in bolus retrograde migration during GER-imp events. RESULTS: According to the urine cotinine assay, 21 of the 31 neonates had been exposed to cigarette smoke during the perinatal period. The number (and frequency) of GER-imp was significantly greater (P = .016) in the exposed group (29 [0-90]) than in the nonexposed group (12 [2-35]). Migration of the esophageal bolus from the distal segment to the most proximal segment was significantly more frequent (P = .016) in the exposed group (83% of GER) than in the nonexposed group (41%). The GER pattern associated with smoking exposure was particularly obvious during Rapid eye movement sleep. CONCLUSIONS: The more frequent occurrence and greater proximal migration of GER-imp in the smoking-exposed group (especially during rapid eye movement sleep) may have clinical relevance. Smoking exposure is a preventable risk factor for limiting the occurrence of GER in neonates.",1
"The Alexander technique can help nurses deal with their stressful jobs, as one group recently discovered in a session aimed at their specific needs. While work  pressure helps people maintain motivation, excessive amounts can be stressful and damaging. The Alexander technique involves learning about stress-induced bad habits, such as tightening the neck muscles. It also involves mental techniques and discipline. Easing the weight-bearing points on the feet can be restorative after a busy day.",0
"The results of study of sleep-wakefulness cycle in experimental models of pre-clinical and early clinical stages of Parkinson's disease present and compared to some clinical examples.

"Research has shown that mindfulness-based treatment interventions may be effective for a range of mental and physical health disorders in adult populations, but little is known about the effectiveness of such interventions for treating adolescent conditions. The present randomized clinical trial was designed to assess the effect of the mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program for adolescents age 14 to 18 years with heterogeneous diagnoses in an outpatient psychiatric facility (intent-to-treat N = 102). Relative to treatment-as-usual control participants, those receiving MBSR self-reported reduced symptoms of anxiety, depression, and somatic distress, and increased self-esteem and sleep quality. Of clinical significance, the MBSR group showed a  higher percentage of diagnostic improvement over the 5-month study period and significant increases in global assessment of functioning scores relative to controls, as rated by condition-naïve clinicians. These results were found in both completer and intent-to-treat samples. The findings provide evidence that MBSR may be a beneficial adjunct to outpatient mental health treatment for adolescents.",0
"AIM: Under natural conditions diurnal rhythms of biological processes of the organism are synchronized with each other and to the environmental changes by means of the circadian system. Disturbances of the latter affect hormonal levels, sleep-wakefulness cycle and cognitive performance. To study mechanisms of such perturbations animal models subjected to artificial photoperiods are often used. The goal of current study was to understand the effects of circadian rhythm disruption, caused by a short light-dark cycle regime, on activity of the cerebral cortex in rodents. METHODS: We used electroencephalogram to assess the distribution of vigilance states, perform spectral analysis, and estimate the homeostatic sleep drive. In addition, we analyzed spontaneous locomotion of C57BL/6J mice under symmetric, 22-, 21-, and 20-h-long light-dark cycles using video recording and tracking methods. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found that shortening of photoperiod caused a significant increase of slow wave activity during non-rapid eye movement sleep suggesting an elevation of sleep pressure under such conditions. While the rhythm of spontaneous locomotion was completely entrained by all light-dark cycles tested, periodic changes in the power of the theta- and gamma-frequency ranges during wakefulness gradually disappeared under 22- and 21-h-long light-dark cycles. This was associated with a significant increase in the theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling during wakefulness. Our results thus provide deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the impairment of learning and memory retention, which is associated with disturbed circadian regulation.",1
"BACKGROUND: Occupational-stress, job-satisfaction and poor health outcomes are closely related and strongly pertain to individuals' mental health and physiological well-being. Falsification of Type is a growing term in the field of organisational psychology that measures occupational stress when working in a job that does not match one's, natural leader. AIM: The present work aims at determining the prevalence of falsification of type and associated socio-demographic and work-related factors. METHODS: The study sample consists of 150 researchers working at the National Research Centre of Egypt. Participants were asked to complete a self-report Falsification of Type Questionnaire, Andrews and Withey scale for Job Satisfaction, in addition to socio-demographic and work-related variables. Statistics included descriptive and comparative analyses. A regression model was  built with falsification of the type as the dependent variable. RESULTS: Facilities showed the highest rate of dissatisfaction in the Job Satisfaction Questionnaire. The most prominent manifestations of falsification were fatigue and irritability, and its predictors were the position, interpersonal relationships, facilities and sex according to the regression model. Falsification of type could seriously contribute to occupational stress. Job satisfaction is highly about falsification. CONCLUSION: More research on the Falsification of Type at work is recommended with the greater attention of employers to the importance of the concept of person-job fit.",0
"There has been no agreement among different authors on guidelines to specify the  situations in which arthrodesis is justified in terms of results, risks and complications. The aim of this study was to identify preoperative predictors of outcome after decompressive lumbar surgery and instrumented posterolateral fusion. A prospective observational study design was performed on 203 consecutive patients. Potential preoperative predictors of outcome included sociodemographic  factors as well as variables pertaining to the preoperative clinical situation, diagnosis, expectations and surgery. Separate multiple linear regression models were used to assess the association between selected predictors and outcome variables, defined as the improvement after 1 year on the visual analog scale (VAS) for back pain, VAS for leg pain, physical component scores (PCS) of SF-36 and Oswestry disability index (ODI). Follow-up was available for 184 patients (90.6%). Patients with higher educational level and optimistic preoperative expectations had a more favourable postoperative leg pain (VAS) and ODI. Smokers  had less leg pain relief. Patients with better mental component score (emotional  health) had greater ODI improvement. Less preoperative walking capacity predicted more leg pain relief. Patients with disc herniation had greater relief from back  pain and more PCS and ODI improvement. More severe lumbar pain was predictive of  less improvement on ODI and PCS. Age, sex, body mass index, analgesic use, surgeon, self-rated health, the number of decompressed levels and the length of fusion had no association with outcome. This study concludes that a higher educational level, optimistic expectations for improvement, the diagnosis of ""disc herniation"", less walking capacity and good emotional health may significantly improve clinical outcome. Smoking and more severe lumbar pain are predictors of worse results.",0
"The structure, morphological and neurochemical bindings ofhistaminergic system of the brain as one of the most important mechanisms of waking maintenance, are regarded.

Some examples of the responses on wakefulness-sleep cycle of the effects of experimental manipulations with the histaminergic system are given.",1
"The hypothalamus monitors body homeostasis and regulates various behaviors such as feeding, thermogenesis, and sleeping. Orexins (also known as hypocretins) were identified as endogenous ligands for two orphan G-protein-coupled receptors in the lateral hypothalamic area. They were initially recognized as regulators of feeding behavior, but they are mainly regarded as key modulators of the sleep/wakefulness cycle. Orexins activate orexin neurons, monoaminergic and cholinergic neurons in the hypothalamus/brainstem regions, to maintain a long, consolidated awake period. Anatomical studies of neural projections from/to orexin neurons and phenotypic characterization of transgenic mice revealed various roles for orexin neurons in the coordination of emotion, energy homeostasis, reward system, and arousal. For example, orexin neurons are regulated by peripheral metabolic cues, including ghrelin, leptin, and glucose concentration. This suggests that they may provide a link between energy homeostasis and arousal states. A link between the limbic system and orexin neurons might be important for increasing vigilance during emotional stimuli. Orexins are also involved in reward systems and the mechanisms of drug addiction. These findings suggest that orexin neurons sense the outer and inner environment of the body and maintain the proper wakefulness level of animals for survival. This review discusses the mechanism by which orexins maintain sleep/wakefulness states and how this mechanism relates to other systems that regulate emotion, reward, and energy homeostasis.",1
"AIMS: There are important ethnic differences in the prevalence of hypertension and hypertension-mediated cardiovascular complications, but there is ongoing debate on the nature of these differences. We assessed the contribution of lifestyle, socio-economic and psychosocial variables to ethnic differences in hypertension prevalence. METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from the Healthy Life In an Urban Setting (HELIUS) study, including 21,520 participants aged 18-70 years of South-Asian Surinamese ( n = 3032), African Surinamese ( n = 4124), Ghanaian ( n = 2331), Turkish ( n = 3594), Moroccan ( n = 3891) and Dutch ( n = 4548) ethnic origin. Ethnic differences in hypertension prevalence rates were examined using logistic  regression models. RESULTS: After adjustment for a broad range of variables, significant higher hypertension prevalence compared to the Dutch population remained in Ghanaian men (odds ratio 2.62 (95% confidence interval 2.14-3.22)) and women (4.16 (3.39-5.12)), African Surinamese men (1.62 (1.37-1.92)) and women (2.70 (2.29-3.17)) and South-Asian Surinamese men (1.22 (1.15-1.46)) and women (1.84 (1.53-2.22)). In contrast, Turkish men (0.72 (0.60-0.87)) and Moroccan men (0.50  (0.41-0.61)) and women (0.57 (0.46-0.71)) had a lower hypertension prevalence compared with the Dutch population. The differences in hypertension prevalence were present across different age groups and persisted after stratification for body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio. CONCLUSION: Large ethnic differences in hypertension prevalence exist that are already present in young adulthood. Adjustment for common variables known to be associated with a higher risk of hypertension explained the higher adjusted prevalence rates among Turks and Moroccans, but not in African and South-Asian descent populations who remained to have a higher rate of hypertension compared to the Dutch host population.",0
"Recent studies inform of increases in reported mental health problems in higher education students worldwide, with suicide and homicide being the most dramatic outcomes. Improving first-hand intervention and implementing mental health prevention and promotion strategies in colleges and universities are amongst the  most commonly mentioned means of addressing these concerns. While institutions increasingly favor mental health promotion, most programs have not been properly  evaluated and most strategies cannot be replicated. The article analyses results  obtained from literature reviews and meta-analysis focusing on mental health prevention and promotion strategies targeting college and university students. Mindfulness, cognitive-behavioral and relaxation strategies, as well as social ability training, appeared to be the most effective if they were practiced under  supervision. The implementation of supervised mental health prevention strategies within a setting-based systematic and multifactorial promotion frame could significantly decrease mental health problems in higher education students.",0
"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the experience of volunteer disaster psychiatrists who provided pro bono psychiatric services to 9/11 survivors in New York City, from September 12, 2001 to November 20, 2001. METHOD: Disaster Psychiatry Outreach (DPO) is a non-profit organization founded in 1998 to provide volunteer psychiatric care to people affected by disasters and to promote education and research in support of this mission. Data for this study were collected from one-page clinical encounter forms completed by 268 DPO psychiatrists for 2 months after 9/11 concerning 848 patients served by the DPO 9/11 response program at the New York City Family Assistance Center. RESULTS: In this endeavor, 268 psychiatrist volunteers evaluated 848 individuals  and provided appropriate interventions. The most commonly recorded clinical impressions indicated stress-related and adjustment disorders, but other conditions such as bereavement, major depression, and substance abuse/dependence  were also observed. Free samples were available for one sedative and one anxiolytic agent; not surprisingly, these were the most commonly prescribed medications. Nearly half of those evaluated received psychotropic medications. CONCLUSIONS: In the acute aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001, volunteer psychiatrists were able to provide services in a disaster response setting, in which they were co-located with other disaster responders. These services included psychiatric assessment, provision of medication, psychological  first aid, and referrals for ongoing care. Although systematic diagnoses could not be confirmed, the fact that most patients were perceived to have a psychiatric diagnosis and a substantial proportion received psychotropic medication suggests potential specific roles for psychiatrists that are unique and different from roles of other mental health professionals in the early post-disaster setting. In addition to further characterizing post-disaster mental health needs and patterns of service provision, future research should focus on the short- and long-term effects of psychiatric interventions, such as providing  acute psychotropic medication services and assessing the effectiveness of traditional acute post-disaster interventions including crisis counseling and psychological first aid.",0
"How animal communities arrive at homogeneous behavioural preferences is a central question for studies of cultural evolution. Here, we investigated whether chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) would relinquish a pre-existing behaviour to adopt  an alternative demonstrated by an overwhelming majority of group mates; in other  words, whether chimpanzees behave in a conformist manner. In each of five groups  of chimpanzees (N = 37), one individual was trained on one method of opening a two-action puzzle box to obtain food, while the remaining individuals learned the alternative method. Over 5 h of open access to the apparatus in a group context,  it was found that 4/5 'minority' individuals explored the majority method and three of these used this new method in the majority of trials. Those that switched did so after observing only a small subset of their group, thereby not matching conventional definitions of conformity. In a further 'Dyad' condition, six pairs of chimpanzees were trained on alternative methods and then given access to the task together. Only one of these individuals ever switched method.  The number of observations that individuals in the minority and Dyad individuals  made of their untrained method was not found to influence whether or not they themselves switched to use it. In a final 'Asocial' condition, individuals (N = 10) did not receive social information and did not deviate from their first-learned method. We argue that these results demonstrate an important influence of social context upon prioritisation of social information over pre-existing methods, which can result in group homogeneity of behaviour.",0
"Voluntary wheel running occurs in mice of all strains, sexes, and ages. Mice find voluntary wheel running rewarding, and it leads to numerous health benefits. For  this reason wheels are used both to enhance welfare and to create models of exercise. However, many designs of running wheel are used. This makes between-study comparisons difficult, as this variability could potentially affect the amount, pattern, and/or intensity of running behaviour, and thence the wheels' effects on welfare and exercise-related changes in anatomy and physiology. This study therefore evaluated two commercially available models, chosen because safe for group-housed mice: Bio Serv®'s ""fast-trac"" wheel combo and Ware Manufacturing Inc.'s stainless steel mesh 5″ upright wheel. Working with a total of three hundred and fifty one female C57BL/6, DBA/2 and BALB/c mice, we  assessed these wheels' relative utilization by mice when access was free; the strength of motivation for each wheel-type when access required crossing an electrified grid; and the impact each wheel had on mouse well-being (inferred from acoustic startle responses and neophobia) and exercise-related anatomical changes (BMI; heart and hind limb masses). Mice ran more on the ""fast-trac"" wheel regardless of whether both wheel-types were available at once, or only if one was present. In terms of motivation, subjects required to work to access a single wheel worked equally hard for both wheel-types (even if locked and thus not useable for running), but if provided with one working wheel for free and the other type of wheel (again unlocked) accessible via crossing the electrified grid, the ""fast-trac"" wheel emerged as more motivating, as the Maximum Price Paid for the Ware metal wheel was lower than that paid for the ""fast-trac"" plastic wheel, at least for C57BL/6s and DBA/2s. No deleterious consequences were noted with either wheel in terms of health and welfare, but only mice with plastic wheels developed significantly larger hearts and hind limbs than control animals  with locked wheels. Thus, where differences emerged, Bio Serv®'s ""fast-trac"" wheel combos appeared to better meet the aims of exercise provision than Ware Manufacturing's steel upright wheels.",0
"In order to clarify the influence of social activities on the feeling of well-being or depression in the elderly, we studied these relationships in 2 groups with different activities. Group I consisted of 26 subjects (mean age, 77.2 years) living in a retirement house and exposed to relatively few social stimuli. Group II consisted of 47 subjects (mean age, 75.6 years) who were living in their own homes and were confirmed to be socially active. The Morale Scale and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) were used to evaluate feelings of well-being or depression. The morale scale in group I was significantly lower than in group II. In particular, there was a significant difference in the factor related to aging. The SDS score of group I was significantly higher than that of  group II. The depressive state incidence was significantly higher in group I than in group II in all subjects. There was a highly significant correlation between the morale scale score and the SDS score. These results indicate that group I is  less satisfied and more depressed than group II. We conclude that social environmental factors are extremely important for the quality of life of elderly  people.",0
"Tricyclic antidepressants decrease rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and may suppress sleep atonia. Reports indicate that these agents can induce visual hallucinations, sometimes characterized as hypnopompic or associated with a dissociated sleep-wakefulness state. In addition, disturbing dreams and confusional states were reported during clinical trials and in subsequent studies. To our knowledge, only two cases of nightmares associated with mirtazapine, a tetracyclic antidepressant, have been previously reported. We describe a 43-year-old Caucasian man with major depressive disorder who started mirtazapine 15 mg at bedtime because he had poor symptom control with other antidepressant drugs. Three days later, vivid dream activity was noted, evolving into realistic nightmares that the patient was not able to distinguish from reality on awakening. Acute paranoia was suspected, and haloperidol was started. The dream activity then ended, and within 3 days the patient was able to identify the dreams as unreality. Haloperidol was discontinued, but mirtazapine was continued, and the vivid dream activity persisted; however, reality testing when awake was intact. A short course of haloperidol restored the patient's reality testing, and mirtazapine was eventually replaced with bupropion. The unusual nocturnal activity resolved as a result. Clinicians should be aware of the possible transition from exceptionally vivid dreams to REM sleep behavior disorder and psychosis based on dream content as an adverse effect of mirtazapine.",1
"BACKGROUND: The main indication for ablation of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVTA) is symptomatic relief. Specific paroxysmal symptoms cannot be quantified with general measures of quality of life, such as with the SF-36 questionnaire. U22 is a new protocol which measures the effects of arrhythmia on well-being, the intensity of discomfort during an episode, the type and temporal characteristics  of dominant symptoms, and the duration and frequency of episodes. Discrete 0-10 scales are used. Unlike SF-36, U22 can be used in individual patients. METHODS: U22 and SF-36 protocols were used in the symptomatic evaluation of 88 patients (mean age = 49.6 +/- 16.4 years; 43 men), who underwent catheter ablation of SVTA. RESULTS: The U22 scores (SD) for (a) well-being (10 being best), (b) effects of arrhythmia on well-being (10 being worst), and (c) discomfort during arrhythmia (10 being worst) were 5.6 (2.7), 7.5 (2.8), and 8.0 (2.4), respectively. For comparison, the physical and mental component summaries of SF-36 were 45.3 (11.0) and 45.2 (12.1), respectively, slightly lower than the expected normal of 50. The intensity of dominant symptom scored by U22 was 9.7 (1.2), 10 being worst. In 29% of patients > or =4 symptoms were equally dominant. Multiple dominant symptoms in U22 were associated with a low general well-being in SF-36. CONCLUSION: We found U22 useful to quantify symptoms associated with SVTA.",0
"Finding the truth is important. In the field of lifestyle medicine the randomized controlled trial has significant limitations. Physicians and patients need to know the truth about the healthy lifestyle changes and their ability to prevent and reverse disease. To meet this challenge, the American College of Lifestyle Medicine has established a committee of experts (HEaLM), under the leadership of  David Katz to create a level of evidence construct for ranking lifestyle medicine evidence that includes evidence from basic science and epidemiologic trials. This tool will be used by the new Expert Lifestyle Medicine Panel to create guidelines and standards of practice.",0
"This article explores the mechanisms of action and the potential responder profile of acamprosate, a compound efficacious in relapse prevention of alcoholism. New evidence at the molecular and cellular level suggests that acamprosate attenuates hyper-glutamatergic states that occur during early abstinence and involves iono (NMDA)- and metabotrotropic (mGluR5) glutamate receptors along with augmented intracellular calcium release and electrophysiological changes. Thus mutant mice with enhanced glutamate levels exhibit higher alcohol consumption than wild type mice and respond better to acamprosate, demonstrating that acamprosate acts mainly on a hyper-glutamatergic  system. This mode of action further suggests that acamprosate exhibits neuroprotective properties. In rats, cue-induced reinstatement behavior is significantly reduced by acamprosate treatment whereas cue-induced craving responses in alcohol-dependent patients seem not to be affected by this treatment. An ongoing study (""Project Predict"") defines specific responder profiles for an individualized use of acamprosate and naltrexone. Neurophysiological as well as psychometric data are used to define 2 groups of patients: ""reward cravers"" and ""relief cravers"". While naltrexone should work better in the first group, acamprosate is hypothesized to be efficacious in the latter where withdrawal associated and/or cue induced hyper-glutamatergic states  are thought to trigger relapse. Further research should target the definition of  subgroups applying endophenotypic approaches, e.g. by detecting a hyperglutamatergic syndrome using MR spectroscopy.",0
"The interaction of age with shift rotation in relation to sleep-wakefulness and inflammation were studied among male employees (n = 772). Cross-sectional analyses in day, two-shift and three-shift work with different shift rotations, as well as changes in leukocytes and hsCRP among three shift workers who changed their shift system during the 2.5- yr follow-up were completed. Shift work was associated with problems to fall asleep (p < 0.001) and feeling of the current working time being harmful to sleep and wakefulness (p < 0.001). Quickly forward-rotation shift workers considered their working time less harmful compared with slower backward-rotation shift workers. Age did not influence sleep in general, but older workers in the quickly forward-rotating three-shift system had less sleep complaints than their younger colleagues. The age differences in the inflammatory markers partly depended on the shift system. The results give some support that rapidly forward-rotating shift systems are more 'age-friendly' than backward-rotating shift systems.",1
"The work was aimed for the ascertainment of following question - whether Orexin-containing neurons of dorsal and lateral hypothalamus and brain Orexinergic system in general are those cellular targets which can accelerate recovery of disturbed sleep homeostasis and restoration of sleep-wakefulness cycle behavioral states from barbiturate anesthesia-induced artificial sleep. Investigation was carried out on 18 wild type white rats (weight 200-250gr). Different doses of Nembutal Sodium were used for the initiation of deep anesthesia. 30 min after barbiturate anesthesia induced artificial sleep serial electrical stimulations of dorsal or lateral hypothalamus were started. Stimulation period lasted for 1 hour with the 5 min intervals between subsequent stimulations applied by turn to the left and right side hypothalamic parts. EEG registration of cortical and hippocampal electrical activity was started 10 min after intra-peritoneal administration of Nembutal Sodium and continued continuously during 72 hour. According to obtained new evidences, serial electrical stimulations of dorsal and lateral hypothalamic Orexin-containing neurons significantly accelerate recovery of wakefulness, sleep homeostasis, disturbed because of barbiturate anesthesia induced artificial sleep and different behavioral states of sleep-wakefulness cycle. Hypothalamic Orexin-containing neurons can be considered as the cellular targets for regulating of sleep homeostasis through the acceleration of recovery of wakefulness, and SWC in general, from barbiturate anesthesia-induced deep sleep.",1
"Virtual Reality (VR) technology can be used to create immersive environments that promote relaxation and distraction, yet it is only with the recent advent of consumer VR platforms that such applications have the potential for widespread dissemination, particularly in the form of consumer-targeted self-help applications available at regular digital marketplaces. If widely distributed and used as intended, such applications have the potential to make a much-needed impact on public mental health. In this study, we report real-world aggregated uptake, usage and application performance statistics from a first-generation consumer-targeted VR relaxation application which has been publicly available for almost 2 years. While a total of 40,000 unique users signals an impressive dissemination potential, average session duration was lower than expected, and the data suggests a low number of recurrent users. Usage of headphones and auxiliary input devices was relatively low, and some application performance issues were evident (e.g., lower than intended framerate and occurrence of overheating). These findings have important implications for the design of the future VR relaxation applications, revealing primarily that user engagement needs to be addressed in the early stage of development by including features that promote prolonged and recurrent use (e.g., gamification elements).",0
"Data about behavioral, somato-vegetative and neurophysiological parameters of sleep and wakefulness in insects, cold- and warm-blooded vertebrates are provided. Hypotheses existing now about evolutionary formation of separate sleep phases and stages in vertebrates are considered. In the review are shown the data about correlations of quantitative characteristics of sleep and wake in some mammals with basic metabolic rate, lifestyle, environmental habits. The original experimental results at formation of neurophysiological characteristics of sleep and wake in vertebrates, phylogeny and in ontogeny of mature and immature mammals are provided in detail. On the basis of own concepts about evolutionary development of sleep-wakefulness cycle in vertebrates the interactions of telencephalic, diencephalic and rhombencepalic parts of brain in the processes of cycle wakefulness cycle integration are discussed.",1
"It is not clear how the age-related changes in sleep are related to performance and subjective sleepiness at different time of the day. The aim of the present study was to study work shift related interactions of age with sleep-wakefulness, performance, and social life. A representative sample of aircraft maintenance workers in a continuous three-shift system was studied by a questionnaire (n = 275) and an on-site field (n = 49) study. In the field study, sleep length and quality and different ratings of social and other activities were studied with an actigraphy and a Pocket PC diary during 15 consecutive days. Subjective sleepiness (KSS) and vigilance performance (PVT) were registered at work. Although the shift type influenced the sleep, subjective sleepiness, performance, and social life, age was distinctly related only to shift-related changes in the amount of sleep, subjective sleepiness, and psychomotor vigilance. Night shifts were related with shorter sleep, decreased performance, and increased sleepiness. Although subjective sleepiness was greatest among the youngest (25-34 years) age group during the morning and the night shifts, the increase of performance lapses was higher among the middle-aged (35-49 years) and senior (50-58 years) groups during the night shifts compared to the youngest age group. According to the questionnaire, older shiftworkers also tended to perceive more frequently that subjective sleepiness decreases their work performance during the morning and night shifts. The results indicate of no direct link between age-related differences in subjective sleepiness and performance at night work. The shorter day sleep after the night shifts and higher deterioration of subjective and objective performance according to age urge on development of shift schedules aiming at lower fatigue levels during the night shifts.",1
"BACKGROUND: Subclinical Narcissism (SN) is part of the Dark Triad (DT), which includes also Subclinical Psychopathy (SP) and Machiavellianism. SN comprises facets retained from the clinical syndrome, such as grandiosity and dominance. Previous cross-sectional and longitudinal research indicates that SN may increase Mental Toughness (MT) resulting in various positive outcomes, including lower levels of psychopathy. METHOD: The researchers conducted three studies (N = 364, 244 and 144 for Study 1, 2 and 3 respectively) to test if the path model from SN to higher MT predicted lower symptoms of depression (DS). An extension to the model considered Openness  to Experience (OE) as a possible mediator. Participants completed self-report measures of SN, MT, OE and DS. In Study 3, participants responded to an additional measure of SN to allow differentiation between grandiose and vulnerable aspects. RESULTS: SN exerted a negative indirect effect on DS through MT across studies; and a negative indirect effect on DS through MT and OE in Study 2. In Study 3, Grandiose SN increased MT contributing to lower DS. Vulnerable SN demonstrated the reverse pattern. MT subfactors of Control and Confidence had a mediating effect across studies. CONCLUSION: The current findings support the model that SN to MT predicts positive outcomes in various domains, including lower levels of psychiatric symptoms. Exploring the link between SN with prosocial traits can be particularly helpful when seeking to identify and promote SN's adaptive tendencies against symptoms of psychopathology.",0
"BACKGROUND: Though a key symptom underlying many anxiety disorders is hypervigilant threat monitoring, its biological bases in humans remain poorly understood. Animal models suggest that anxious processes such as hypervigilant threat monitoring are distinct from cued fear-like responses and mediated by the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Here, we applied psychophysiological and neuroimaging methodologies sensitive to sustained arousal-based responses to test the role of the human BNST in mediating environmental threat monitoring, a potential experimental model for sustained anxiety symptoms. METHODS: Healthy participants (n = 50) with varying trait anxiety performed an environmental threat-monitoring task during functional magnetic resonance imaging where a stimulus line continuously fluctuated in height, providing information relevant to subsequent risk for electric shocks. Skin conductance was collected in a separate cohort (n = 47) to validate task-evoked modulation of physiological arousal. RESULTS: A forebrain region consistent with the BNST showed greater overall recruitment and exaggerated tracking of threat proximity in individuals with greater anxiety. The insular cortex tracked threat proximity across all participants, showed exaggerated threat proximity responding with greater anxiety, and showed enhanced recruitment when threat proximity was ostensibly controllable. CONCLUSIONS: Activity in the BNST and insula continuously monitored changes in environmental threat level and also subserved hypervigilant threat-monitoring processes in more highly trait anxious individuals. These findings bridge human and animal research informing the role of the BNST in anxious-related processes. In addition, these findings suggest that continuous functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigms offer promise in further elucidating the neural circuitries supporting sustained anticipatory features of anxiety.",1
"Anxiety disorders increase risk for the early development of several diseases of aging. Elevated inflammation, a common risk factor across diseases of aging, may play a key role in the relationship between anxiety and physical disease. However, the neurobiological mechanisms linking anxiety with elevated inflammation remain unclear. In this review, we present a neurobiological model of the mechanisms by which anxiety promotes inflammation. Specifically we propose that exaggerated neurobiological sensitivity to threat in anxious individuals may lead to sustained threat perception, which is accompanied by prolonged activation of threat-related neural circuitry and threat-responsive biological systems including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, autonomic nervous system (ANS), and inflammatory response. Over time, this pattern of responding can promote chronic inflammation through structural and functional brain changes, altered sensitivity of immune cell receptors, dysregulation of the HPA axis and ANS, and accelerated cellular aging. Chronic inflammation, in turn, increases risk for diseases of aging. Exaggerated neurobiological sensitivity to threat may thus be a treatment target for reducing disease risk in anxious individuals.",1
"Excess gestational weight gain (GWG) is associated with the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Lifestyle trials have not achieved much GWG  limitation, and have largely failed to prevent GDM. We compared the effect of substantial GWG limitation on maternal GDM risk. Pregnant women with a body mass  index (BMI) ≥29 kg/m² <20 weeks gestation without GDM (n = 436) were randomized,  in a multicenter trial, to usual care (UC), healthy eating (HE), physical activity (PA), or HE and PA lifestyle interventions. GWG over the median was associated with higher homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)  and insulin secretion (Stumvoll phases 1 and 2), a higher fasting plasma glucose  (FPG) at 24⁻28 weeks (4.66 ± 0.43 vs. 4.61 ± 0.40 mmol/L, p < 0.01), and a higher rate of caesarean section (38% vs. 27% p < 0.05). The GWG over the median at 35⁻37 weeks was associated with a higher rate of macrosomia (25% vs. 16%, p < 0.05). A post hoc comparison among women from the five sites with a GWG difference >3 kg showed no significance difference in glycaemia or insulin resistance between HE and PA, and UC. We conclude that preventing even substantial increases in GWG after the first trimester has little effect on maternal glycaemia. We recommend randomized controlled trials of effective lifestyle interventions, starting in or before the first trimester.",0
"South Asian population is facing rapid changes in dietary pattern with a shift from healthy traditional high fibre diet to calorie-dense low fibre. This has resulted in epidemic of lifestyle disorders including diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease in these populations. High fibre diet has shown to decrease risk of these lifestyle disorders as well as many gastrointestinal disorders including colorectal cancer. There is an urgent need to increase fibre  component in the diet of these populations to prevent the lifestyle disorders. This review focusses on health benefits of high fibre diet and ways to increase fibre in South Asian diet.",0
"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether lifestyle habits and dietary factors at age 8-10  years predict the development of metabolically unhealthy obesity 2 years later among children who were previously metabolically healthy obese. STUDY DESIGN: The QUebec Adipose and Lifestyle InvesTigation in Youth cohort comprises 630 youth with a parental history of obesity. Metabolically healthy obesity and metabolically unhealthy obesity were defined using cut-offs for the components of pediatric metabolic syndrome. Dietary factors, physical activity, fitness, sedentary behavior, screen time, and sleep duration were measured. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to examine associations. RESULTS: At baseline, 48 participants with metabolically healthy obesity were identified; 2 years later, 19 became metabolically unhealthy obese and 29 remained metabolically healthy obese. Every additional daily portion of fruits and vegetables decreased the risk of converting to metabolically unhealthy obesity by 39% (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40-0.94). Cumulating more hours of screen time  and diets high in saturated fat and sugar-sweetened beverages and low in protein  were associated with a tendency to develop metabolically unhealthy obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Fruit and vegetable intake and possibly screen time, saturated fat,  sugar-sweetened beverages, and protein intake may be important targets for the prevention of cardiometabolic complications in obese children. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03356262.",0
"Background: Existing data on the clinical features and outcomes of immunocompromised children with influenza are limited. Methods: Data from the 2011-2012 through 2014-2015 influenza seasons were collected as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET). We compared clinical features and outcomes between immunocompromised and nonimmunocompromised children (<18 years old) hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed community-acquired influenza. Immunocompromised children were defined as those for whom ≥1 of the following applies: human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, cancer, stem cell or solid organ transplantation, nonsteroidal immunosuppressive therapy, immunoglobulin deficiency, complement deficiency, asplenia, and/or another rare condition. The primary outcomes were intensive care admission, duration of hospitalization, and in-hospital death. Results: Among 5262 hospitalized children, 242 (4.6%) were immunocompromised; receipt of nonsteroidal immunosuppressive therapy (60%), cancer (39%), and solid  organ transplantation (14%) were most common. Immunocompromised children were older than the nonimmunocompromised children (median, 8.8 vs 2.8 years, respectively; P < .001), more likely to have another comorbidity (58% vs 49%, respectively; P = .007), and more likely to have received an influenza vaccination (58% vs 39%, respectively; P < .001) and early antiviral treatment (35% vs 27%, respectively; P = .013). In multivariable analyses, immunocompromised children were less likely to receive intensive care (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.31 [0.20-0.49]) and had a slightly longer duration of hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio of hospital discharge [95% confidence interval], 0.89 [0.80-0.99]). Death was uncommon in both groups. Conclusions: Immunocompromised children hospitalized with influenza received intensive care less frequently but had a longer hospitalization duration than nonimmunocompromised children. Vaccination and early antiviral use could be improved substantially. Data are needed to determine whether immunocompromised children are more commonly admitted with milder influenza severity than are nonimmunocompromised children.",0
"The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and central amygdala (CeA) of the extended amygdala are small, anatomically interconnected brain regions. They are thought to mediate responses to sustained, unpredictable threat stimuli and phasic, predictable threat stimuli, respectively. They perform these operations largely through their interconnected networks. In two previous studies, we mapped and contrasted the resting functional connectivity networks of the BNST and CeA at 7 Tesla with high resolution. This follow-up study investigates the changes in functional connectivity of these structures during sustained anticipation of electric shock. Results show that the BNST and CeA become less strongly coupled with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), cingulate, and nucleus accumbens in shock threat relative to a safety condition. In addition, the CeA becomes more strongly coupled with the thalamus under threat. An exploratory, whole-brain connectivity analysis reveals that, although the BNST/CeA exhibits generally decreased connectivity, many other cortical regions demonstrate greater coupling under threat than safety. Understanding the differential network structures of these two regions and how they contribute to processing under threat will help elucidate the building blocks of the anxious state.",1
"Different degrees of threat predictability are thought to induce either phasic fear or sustained anxiety. Maladaptive, sustained anxious apprehension is thought to result in overgeneralization of anxiety and thereby to contribute to the development of anxiety disorders. Therefore, differences in threat predictability have been associated with pathological states of anxiety with specific phobia (SP) representing phasic fear as heightened response to predictable threat, while panic disorder (PD) is characterized by sustained anxiety (unpredictable threat) and, as a consequence, overgeneralization of fear. The present study aimed to delineate commonalities and differences in the neural substrates of the impact of threat predictability on affective processing in these two anxiety disorders. Twenty PD patients, 20 SP patients and 20 non-anxious control subjects were investigated with an adapted NPU-design (no, predictable, unpredictable threat) using whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG). Group independent neural activity in the right dlPFC increased with decreasing threat predictability. PD patients showed a sustained hyperactivation of the vmPFC under threat and safety conditions. The magnitude of hyperactivation was inversely correlated with PDs subjective arousal and anxiety sensitivity. Both PD and SP patients revealed decreased parietal processing of affective stimuli. Findings indicate overgeneralization between threat and safety conditions and increased need for emotion regulation via the vmPFC in PD, but not SP patients. Both anxiety disorders showed decreased activation in parietal networks possibly indicating attentional avoidance of affective stimuli. Present results complement findings from fear conditioning studies and underline overgeneralization of fear, particularly in PD.",1
"The present study examined the effects of sustained anticipatory anxiety on the affective modulation of the eyeblink startle reflex. Towards this end, pleasant, neutral and unpleasant pictures were presented as a continuous stream during alternating threat-of-shock and safety periods, which were cued by colored picture frames. Orbicularis-EMG to auditory startle probes and electrodermal activity were recorded. Previous findings regarding affective picture valence and threat-of-shock modulation were replicated. Of main interest, anticipating aversive events and viewing affective pictures additively modulated defensive activation. Specifically, despite overall potentiated startle blink magnitude in threat-of-shock conditions, the startle reflex remained sensitive to hedonic picture valence. Finally, skin conductance level revealed sustained sympathetic activation throughout the entire experiment during threat- compared to safety-periods. Overall, defensive activation by physical threat appears to operate independently from reflex modulation by picture media. The present data confirms the importance of simultaneously manipulating phasic-fear and sustained-anxiety in studying both normal and abnormal anxiety.",1
"In this industrial-based study we compared the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effectiveness of relaxation, a beta blocker, and the combined use of these two treatments in 47 untreated, mildly hypertensive blue collar steel workers. Using  a randomized two by two factorial design, patients received either nadolol or placebo drug daily, and either a relaxation training or an education program, each lasting 8 weeks. A pre-intervention and post-intervention stress test measured response of heart rate and BP to mental and physical tasks. BP assessments were done at baseline, post-intervention, 1 month, and 3 month follow-up. Change in several self-report measures was determined. Results showed  that beta blocker was more effective in lowering BP than placebo, but relaxation  was not more effective in lowering BP than health education. The combined effect  of beta blocker and relaxation was not superior to beta blocker alone. Compliance with relaxation practice was not superior to compliance with medication. We conclude that pharmacologic treatment is superior to the relaxation therapy tested.",0
"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States and the leading cause of death in the U.S. American Indian/Alaskan Natives (AI/ANs), who comprise only 2% of the total population. The AI/AN population has  a high prevalence of DM in adults aged 20 years or older and is developing DM at  a younger age than the general U.S.POPULATION: DM is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mortality from CVD is higher in AI/ANs than the general population, as is the prevalence of stroke and 1-year poststroke mortality for both genders when compared to non-Hispanic whites. A genome-wide scan found a number of chromosome linkages in the AI/AN population that suggest that genetic factors may contribute to their high risk of DM and CVD. Importantly, studies also suggest that in addition to race/ethnicity, cultural norms and historic conditions play important roles in the prevalence of DM and CVD in this population. Therefore, multiple factors should be taken into consideration when establishing prevention programs to decrease the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and CVD incidence among adults and children in the AI/AN population. Prevention programs should focus on behavioral risk factors and lifestyle changes like encouraging smoking cessation, healthy diet, and increased physical activity while taking into consideration cultural, economic, and geographic factors.",0
"The error-related negativity (ERN) currently appears as a physiological measure in relation to three Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) constructs: Cognitive Control, Sustained Threat, and Reward Learning. We propose a conceptual model in which variance in the ERN reflects individual differences in the degree to which errors are evaluated as threatening. We also discuss evidence for the placement of the ERN in the ""Sustained Threat"" construct, as well as evidence that the ERN may more specifically reflect sensitivity to endogenous threat. Following this, we present data from a sample of 515 adolescent females demonstrating a larger ERN in relation to self-reported checking behaviors, but only in older adolescents, suggesting that sensitivity to internal threat and the ERN-checking relationship may follow a developmental course as adolescents develop behavioral control. In contrast, depressive symptoms were linked to a smaller ERN, and this association was invariant with respect to age. Collectively, these data suggest that the magnitude of the ERN is sensitive both to specific anxiety-related processes and depression, in opposing directions that may reflect variation in internal threat sensitivity. We discuss directions for future research, as well as ways in which findings for the ERN complement and challenge aspects of the current RDoC matrix.",1
"This article introduces an instrument for the indirect assessment of positive and negative affect, the Implicit Positive and Negative Affect Test (IPANAT). This test draws on participant ratings of the extent to which artificial words subjectively convey various emotions. Factor analyses of these ratings yielded two independent factors that can be interpreted as implicit positive and negative affect. The corresponding scales show adequate internal consistency, test-retest  reliability, stability (Study 1), and construct validity (Study 2). Studies 3 and 4 demonstrate that the IPANAT also measures state variance. Finally, Study 5 provides criterion-based validity by demonstrating that correlations between implicit affect and explicit affect are higher under conditions of spontaneous responding than under conditions of reflective responding to explicit affect scales. The present findings suggest that the IPANAT is a reliable and valid measure with a straightforward application procedure.",0
"The relaxation response, relaxation with mental imagery/self-hypnosis, and centering are techniques that can be used by the nurse practitioner in a variety  of clinical situations to help children and young people manage stress. These approaches also can be used to treat certain common pediatric problems, such as headaches, enuresis, acute and chronic pain, and habit disorders. The techniques  and their appropriate use are described.",0
"Vitamin D deficiency and quantitative ultrasound measurements are associated with bone fragility. We assessed these parameters and their correlates. 87.7% of the population has vitamin D inadequacy and this correlated with lifestyle factors. These results contribute to epidemiological data needed for population guidelines for bone health.PURPOSE: Vitamin D deficiency and quantitative ultrasound (QUS) parameters are among the most important clinical risk factors of bone fragility.  Few data are available for Greek population. The aim of the study was to evaluate the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level and their determinants, as well as  QUS parameters in Greek population. METHODS: OSTEOS is an observational cross-sectional study conducted from June 2010 to July 2012. Nine hundred seventy adults were recruited from rural and urban areas throughout Greece and completed the appropriate questionnaire. Serum  25(OH)D measured by enzyme immunoassay, QUS parameters, broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), speed of sound (SOS) and stiffness index (SI), was assessed with an Achilles device. Univariate Analysis of Variance was used for the assessment of serum 25(OH)D determinants. RESULTS: Mean serum 25(OH)D of the total population was 20,00 ± 8,00 ng/mL. Females had lower levels than males. The negative determinants of serum 25(OH)D in the total population were the female sex and the winter-spring season of sampling while age proved negative association solely in obese subjects. Positive determinants of vitamin D status were summer sun exposure and organized physical  activity as expected. Urban had lower SOS and SI than rural residents. Individuals with 25(OH)D ≥ 20 ng/mL had higher SOS than those with 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL. BUA, SOS, and SI are positively correlated with organized physical activity and negatively with PTH. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports that vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among healthy Greek men and women, demonstrates the multifactorial causation of 25(OH)D levels, and points out that further research is required to determine more factors related to vitamin D status and bone health.",0
"The effects of mood upon imaginal thought were explored with a highly trained undergraduate female hypnotic subject. She was hypnotically programmed to experience free-floating anxiety or pleasure in varying degrees just before the exposure of combinations of three Blacky Pictures, and to produce dreamlike imagery in response to the Blacky stimuli while under sway of the mood. Data from 98 dream trials, separated by amnesia, indicated that the affective states clearly influenced imaginal processes. Blind ratings by a psychoanalyst showed anxiety moods to be more closely associated with primary-process features characteristic of nocturnal dreams, whereas pleasure had a relatively higher incidence of daydreamlike ratings. Empirical analysis of themes yielded significant relationships of anxiety to physical injury to the self and verbal aggression toward others; pleasure was associated with circular movements and overt sex themes.",0
"BACKGROUND: Abnormal patterns of attention to threat and reward have been proposed as potential mechanisms of dysfunction in anxiety and mood disorders. However, research on this topic has been inconsistent, perhaps because of both clinical heterogeneity in the samples assessed and measurement of attentional biases that is temporally imprecise. METHODS: The present study measured transdiagnostic symptoms of anxiety and depression in 205 young adults and recorded affect-modulated event-related potentials in response to task-irrelevant pictures in a speeded response task. RESULTS: Low positive affect was uniquely associated with reduced modulation of later event-related potentials (i.e., the P300 and the late positive potential) by rewarding images, suggesting deficits in sustained attention to reward. Low positive affect was also associated with a blunted threat-elicited late positive potential. Symptoms of panic were associated with an increased N1 to rewarding images, as well as an increased late positive potential to all picture types. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that dysfunction in neural markers of sustained attention to threat and reward relate in specific ways to transdiagnostic symptom dimensions of anxiety and depression. Moreover, event-related potentials are likely to be useful in investigations of the time course of attentional abnormalities associated with these symptom dimensions.",1
"Cardiac syndrome X, the triad of angina pectoris, positive exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) for myocardial ischemia and angiographically smooth coronary arteries, is associated with increased psychological morbidity, debilitating symptomatology and a poor quality of life. Patients with noncardiac  chest pain (NCCP) are often similarly affected. The psychological morbidity noted among this patient population has been linked with a number of psychosocial factors, including impaired social support, traumatic life events, the negative impact of menopause among female sufferers, and an awareness of a family history  of coronary heart disease (CHD). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), group support, physical activity and relaxation techniques have been investigated as treatments for psychological morbidity among this patient group with varying degrees of success. While clinicians should be aware of the psychological aspect  of patients with NCCP and cardiac syndrome X, further research is needed in order to establish a comprehensive physiological and psychological treatment regimen.",0
"The creation of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project has been the driving force behind the reconceptualization of the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. In this commentary, I explore whether the error-related negativity can be considered as a transdiagnostic marker of sustained threat based on findings from Weinberg, Meyer et al.'s (2016) study in relation to current findings in the literature. Potential alternative study designs, use of a multimodal approach to the assessment of a specific phenotype of clinical phenomenon, and the importance of integrating a neurodevelopmental perspective are also discussed.",1
"The present study was based on the hypothesis that stress may contribute to increased intraocular pressure (IOP) in open-angle glaucoma patients. It is investigated whether IOP reactivity to a mental stressor test (MST) can be influenced by relaxation training. Twenty three patients with open-angle glaucoma were randomly assigned either to a training group (TG) or to a waiting-list control group (CG). Prior to as well as after the completion of the training all  patients were exposed to the MST. IOP and heart rate as well as self-ratings of psychological strain were assessed three times: (1) at baseline, (2) after exposition to the stressor, and (3) after a 10-min relaxation phase. Results provide evidence that the MST is a valid procedure to induce psychophysiological  activation and that elevated IOP levels in open-angle glaucoma patients might be  provoked by stressing situations. However, participation in the relaxation training did not influence IOP stress reactivity.",0
"ABC Relaxation Theory proposes 15 psychological relaxation-related states (R-States): Sleepiness, Disengagement, Physical Relaxation, Mental Quiet, Rested/Refreshed, At Ease/At Peace, Energized, Aware, Joy, Thankfulness and Love, Prayerfulness, Childlike Innocence, Awe and Wonder, Mystery, and Timeless/Boundless/Infinite. The present study summarizes the results of 13 separate factor analyses of immediate relaxation-related states, states associated with recalled relaxation activities, relaxation dispositions, and relaxation motivations on a combined sample of 1,904 individuals (group average ages ranged from 28-40 yr.). Four exploratory factor analyses of Smith Relaxation Inventories yielded 15 items that most consistently and exclusively load (generally at least .70) on six replicated factors. These items included happy, joyful, energized, rested, at peace, warm, limp, silent, quiet, dozing, drowsy, prayerful, mystery, distant, and indifferent. Subsequent factor analyses restricted to these items and specifying six factors were performed on 13 different data sets. Each yielded the same six-factor solution: Factor 1: Centered Positive Affect, Factor 2: Sleepiness, Factor 3: Disengagement, Factor 4: Physical Relaxation, Factor 5: Mental Quiet, and Factor 6: Spiritual. Implications for ABC Relaxation Theory are discussed.",0
"Among cathinone drugs known as bath salts, methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) exerts its potent actions via the dopamine (DA) system, and at intoxicating doses may produce adverse behavioral effects. Previous work by our group suggests that  prolonged alterations in correlated neural activity between cortical and striatal areas could underlie, at least in part, the adverse reactions to this bath salt drug. In the present study, we assessed the effect of acute MDPV administration on brain functional connectivity at 1 and 24 h in rats. Using graph theory metrics to assess in vivo brain functional network organization we observed that  24 h after MDPV administration there was an increased clustering coefficient, rich club index, and average path length. Increases in these metrics suggests that MDPV produces a prolonged pattern of correlated activity characterized by greater interactions between subsets of high degree nodes but a reduced interaction with regions outside this core subset. Further analysis revealed that the core set of nodes include prefrontal cortical, amygdala, hypothalamic, somatosensory and striatal areas. At the molecular level, MDPV downregulated the  dopamine transporter (DAT) in striatum and produced a shift in its subcellular distribution, an effect likely to involve rapid internalization at the membrane.  These new findings suggest that potent binding of MDPV to DAT may trigger internalization and a prolonged alteration in homeostatic regulation of DA and functional brain network reorganization. We propose that the observed MDPV-induced network reorganization and DAergic changes may contribute to previously reported adverse behavioral responses to MDPV.",0
"Biased attention to emotional stimuli plays a key role in the RDoC constructs of Sustained Threat and Loss. In this article, we review approaches to assessing these biases, their links with psychopathology, and the underlying neural influences. We then review evidence from twin and candidate gene studies regarding genetic influences on attentional biases. We also discuss the impact of developmental and environmental influences and end with a number of suggestions for future research in this area.",1
"Medical students are a population at risk for the development of stress-related risk states (e.g. burnout) and manifest mental disorders (e.g. depression). Still the learning of coping mechanisms against stress is not an integral part of the medical curriculum. In a pilot study we developed an elective course for learning relaxation techniques (Relacs) which was geared to the clinical practice of autogenic training (AT) with psychiatric patients. The course focussed on an innovative and mostly communicative transfer of knowledge about AT, progressive muscle relaxation and medical hypnosis and stressed the principle of repeated and supervised exercises in small student groups alongside self-administered exercise. 42 students took part in this course and showed a very high acceptance  for the topic and positive evaluation. Moreover, we found a distinct improvement  of the participants' mental parameters (burnout, anxiety) and a good knowledge about the course's contents within the final exams at the end of the semester. The structure and realisation of the course is easily adaptable and very effective regarding the improvement of the students' mental health. Due to our results and the commonly known prevalence of stress-related disorders in medical  students we postulate the integration of courses on relaxation strategies in the  medical curriculum.",0
"Researchers have only recently begun using functional neuroimaging to explore the human response to periods of sustained anxious anticipation, namely potential threat. Here, we investigated brain responses acquired with functional MRI during an instructed threat of shock paradigm used to create sustained periods of aversive anticipation. In this re-analysis of previously published data, we employed quadratic discriminant analysis to classify the multivariate pattern of whole-brain functional connectivity and to identify connectivity changes during periods of potential threat. Our method identifies clusters with altered connectivity on a voxelwise basis, thus eschewing the need to define regions a priori. Classifier generalization was evaluated by testing on data from participants not used during training. Robust classification between threat and safe contexts was possible, and inspection of ""diagnostic features"" revealed altered functional connectivity involving the intraparietal sulcus, task-negative regions, striatum, and anterior cingulate cortex. We anticipate that the proposed method will prove useful to experimenters wishing to identify large-scale functional networks that distinguish between experimental conditions or groups.",1
"This paper describes a method of measuring baroreceptor cardiac reflex sensitivity noninvasively from spontaneous patterns of blood pressure and interbeat interval, and the application of this technique in psychophysiology. Baroreflex function was assessed in 24 female volunteers during relaxation and performance of the cold pressor test and a non-verbal mental arithmetic task. Blood pressure and interbeat interval were monitored continuously from the finger using the vascular unloading technique. Sequences of three or more cardiac cycles were identified over which systolic blood pressure increased progressively in conjunction with lengthening interbeat interval, or systolic blood pressure decreased as interbeat interval was reduced. The regression between systolic blood pressure and interbeat interval was computed as an index of baroreflex sensitivity. Relaxation was associated with a small prolongation of interbeat interval, whereas baroreflex sensitivity increased from 17.1 to 19.8 ms/mmHg. Baroreflex sensitivity was reduced significantly during mental arithmetic (mean 14.2 ms/mmHg) but not during the cold pressor test (mean 17.4 ms/mmHg). The difference between mental arithmetic and the cold pressor test may be related to  the relative intensity of cardiac and vascular responses in the two situations. The implications of these results for the understanding of behavioural influences on haemodynamic function are discussed and the advantages of noninvasive methods  are considered.",0
"Here we introduce the design and preliminary validation of a general-purpose architecture for affective-driven procedural content generation in Virtual Reality (VR) applications in mental health and wellbeing. The architecture supports seven commercial physiological sensing technologies and can be deployed  in immersive and non-immersive VR systems. To demonstrate the concept, we developed the ""The Emotional Labyrinth"", a non-linear scenario in which navigation in a procedurally-generated 3D maze is entirely decided by the user, and whose features are dynamically adapted according to a set of emotional states. During navigation, affective states are dynamically represented through pictures, music, and animated visual metaphors chosen to represent and induce affective states. The underlying hypothesis is that exposing users to multimodal  representations of their affective states can create a feedback loop that supports emotional self-awareness and fosters more effective emotional regulation strategies. We carried out a first study to (i) assess the effectiveness of the selected metaphors in inducing target emotions, and (ii) identify relevant psycho-physiological markers of the emotional experience generated by the labyrinth. Results show that the Emotional Labyrinth is overall a pleasant experience in which the proposed procedural content generation can induce distinctive psycho-physiological patterns, generally coherent with the meaning of the metaphors used in the labyrinth design. Further, collected psycho-physiological responses such as electrocardiography, respiration, electrodermal activity, and electromyography are used to generate computational models of users' reported experience. These models enable the future implementation of the closed loop mechanism to adapt the Labyrinth procedurally to the users' affective state.",0
"Contextual fear conditioning takes place if the occurrence of threat cannot be predicted by specific cues. As a consequence the context becomes the best predictor of the threat and later induces anxiety (sustained fear response). Previous studies suggest that both the amygdala and the hippocampus are crucial for contextual fear conditioning. First, we wanted to further elucidate the neuronal correlates of long-lasting contextual threat within a highly ecologically setting created in virtual reality (VR). Second, we wanted to distinguish between initial and sustained components of the anxiety response to a threatening situation. Twenty-four participants were guided through two virtual offices for 30s each. They received unpredictable electric stimuli (unconditioned stimulus, US) in one office (anxiety context, CXT+), but never in the second office (safety context, CXT-). Successful contextual fear conditioning was indexed by higher anxiety and enhanced US-expectancy ratings for CXT+ versus CXT-. Initial neural activity was assessed by modeling the onsets of both contexts, and sustained neural activity by considering the entire context duration (contrasts: CXT+ > CXT-). Amygdala and hippocampus revealed sustained activity. Initial and sustained activities were found in the middle temporal gyrus, and primary motor cortex (M1). Additional initial activity was obvious in orbitofrontal (OFC), dorsomedial (dmPFC), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). These results suggest that entering a threatening context initially induces conditioned fear reactions (M1), recall of contingency awareness (dlPFC), and explicit threat appraisal (dmPFC, OFC). While remaining in the threatening context might involve anxiety-like conditioned responses (amygdala, M1) and the generation of a spatial map to predict where and when a threatening event may occur (hippocampus). We conclude that in humans initial versus sustained anxiety responses triggered by a threat associated context are associated with distinguishable brain activation patterns involving a fear network and a ""contingency-cognitive"" network, respectively.",1
"Glutamatergic transmission in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) is a substrate  for reward learning and motivation. Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors regulate NAcSh synaptic strength by inducing long-term depression (LTD). Inputs from prefrontal cortex (PFC) and medio-dorsal thalamus (MDT) drive opposing motivated behaviors yet mGlu receptor regulation of these synapses is unexplored. We examined Group I mGlu receptor regulation of PFC and MDT glutamatergic synapses onto specific populations of NAc medium spiny neurons (MSNs) using D1tdTom BAC transgenic mice and optogenetics. Synaptically evoked long-term depression (LTD) at MDT-NAcSh synapses required mGlu5 but not mGlu1 and was specific for D1(+) MSNs, whereas PFC LTD was expressed at both D1(+) and D1(-) MSNs and required mGlu1 but not mGlu5. Two weeks after five daily non-contingent  cocaine exposures (15 mg/kg), LTD was attenuated at MDT-D1(+) synapses but was rescued by the mGlu5-positive allosteric modulator (PAM) VU0409551. These results highlight unique plasticity mechanisms regulating specific NAcSh synapses.",0
"Electroencephalograms were recorded in 22 men while solving tasks of visual-pattern completion and during mental relaxation. They were primed (by foregoing trials) to solve these tasks either in a predicative or functional mode of thinking. Predicative thinking required that in order to complete the pattern  the subject had to get involved with the logic of the static structure of the pattern and therefore had to recognize the recurrence of certain features of the  elements (e.g., shape, color, and size). Functional thinking required involvement in a dynamic reading of the logic of the pattern and therefore to search for operations and actions to be performed on the pattern elements (e.g., pushing, mirroring, and rotating). The EEG complexity during predicative thinking decreased in comparison to functional thinking and mental relaxation, with this reduction being most pronounced over the right parietal cortex. A reduction in dimensional complexity during functional thinking as compared to mental relaxation, which was concentrated over the left central cortex, although significant, was less clear. The reduced EEG complexity during predicative thought, dominant over the right hemisphere, could reflect increased competitive  inhibition among respective cortical neuron assemblies in association with the visual analysis of static element features, converging upon those predicates relevant for the solution.",0
"This essay develops a new conceptual framework of science and engineering ethics  education based on virtue ethics and positive psychology. Virtue ethicists and positive psychologists have argued that current rule-based moral philosophy, psychology, and education cannot effectively promote students' moral motivation for actual moral behavior and may even lead to negative outcomes, such as moral schizophrenia. They have suggested that their own theoretical framework of virtue ethics and positive psychology can contribute to the effective promotion of motivation for self-improvement by connecting the notion of morality and eudaimonic happiness. Thus this essay attempts to apply virtue ethics and positive psychology to science and engineering ethics education and to develop a  new conceptual framework for more effective education. In addition to the conceptual-level work, this essay suggests two possible educational methods: moral modeling and involvement in actual moral activity in science and engineering ethics classes, based on the conceptual framework.",0
"Several lines of evidence suggest that the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) are differentially involved in phasic and sustained fear. Even though, results from neuroimaging studies support this distinction, a specific effect of a temporal dissociation with phasic responses to onset versus sustained responses during prolonged states of threat anticipation has not been shown yet. To explore this issue, we investigated brain activation during anticipation of threat in 38 healthy participants by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants were presented different visual cues indicated the temporally unpredictable occurrence of a subsequent aversive or neutral stimulus. During the onset of aversive versus neutral anticipatory cues, results showed a differential phasic activation of amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). In contrast, activation in the BNST and other brain regions, including insula, dorsolateral PFC, ACC, cuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, and periaqueductal grey was characterized by a sustained response during the threat versus neutral anticipation period. Analyses of functional connectivity showed phasic amygdala response as positively associated with activation, mainly in sensory cortex areas whereas sustained BNST activation was negatively associated with activation in visual cortex and positively correlated with activation in the insula and thalamus. These findings suggest that the amygdala is responsive to the onset of cues signaling the unpredictable occurrence of a potential threat while the BNST in concert with other areas is involved in sustained anxiety. Furthermore, the amygdala and BNST are characterized by distinctive connectivity patterns during threat anticipation.",1
"Most clinicians agree that biobehavioural factors are important considerations in the assessment and treatment of headache patients. Attention to psychological and behavioural issues may become even a greater concern as the frequency of a patient's headaches increases, there is increased disability secondary to headaches and/or there is inadequate response to usually effective treatment. The present article will highlight biobehavioural factors that should be considered in the assessment process involving headache patients and will provide a model for integration of behavioural treatment into clinical practice.",0
"BACKGROUND: Processes of phasic fear responses to threatening stimuli are thought to be distinct from sustained, anticipatory anxiety toward an unpredicted, potential threat. There is evidence for dissociable neural correlates of phasic fear and sustained anxiety. Whereas increased amygdala activity has been associated with phasic fear, sustained anxiety has been linked with activation of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the insula. So far, only a few studies have focused on the dissociation of neural processes related to both phasic and sustained fear in specific phobia. We suggested that first, conditions of phasic and sustained fear would involve different neural networks and, second, that overall neural activity would be enhanced in a sample of phobic compared to nonphobic participants. METHODS: Pictures of spiders and neutral stimuli under conditions of either predicted (phasic) or unpredicted (sustained) fear were presented to 28 subjects with spider phobia and 28 nonphobic control subjects during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. RESULTS: Phobic patients revealed significantly higher amygdala activation than controls under conditions of phasic fear. Sustained fear processing was significantly related to activation in the insula and ACC, and phobic patients showed a stronger activation than controls of the BNST and the right ACC under conditions of sustained fear. Functional connectivity analysis revealed enhanced connectivity of the BNST and the amygdala in phobic subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the idea of distinct neural correlates of phasic and sustained fear processes. Increased neural activity and functional connectivity in these networks might be crucial for the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders.",1
"Blood-injection-injury (BII) phobia differs from other subtypes of specific phobia in that it is associated with elevated disgust-sensitivity as well as specific autonomic and brain responses during processing of phobia-relevant stimuli. To what extent these features play a role already during threat anticipation is unclear. In the current fMRI experiment, 16 female BII phobics and 16 female healthy controls anticipated the presentation of phobia-specific and neutral pictures. On the behavioral level, anxiety dominated the anticipatory period in BII phobics relative to controls, while both anxiety and disgust were elevated during picture presentation. By applying two different models for the analysis of brain responses to anticipation of phobia-specific versus neutral stimuli, we found initial and sustained increases of activation in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, lateral and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), thalamus and visual areas, as well as initial activation in the amygdala for BII phobics as compared to healthy controls. These results suggest that BII phobia is characterized by activation of a typical neural defense network during threat anticipation, with anxiety as the predominant emotion.",1
"An important aspect of crisis counseling is linking survivors with services for their unmet needs. We examined determinants of referrals for disaster relief, additional crisis counseling, and psychological services in 703,000 crisis counseling encounters 3-18 months after Hurricane Katrina. Referrals for disaster relief were predicted by clients' losses, age (adults rather than children), and  urbanicity. Referrals for additional counseling and psychological services were predicted by urbanicity, losses and trauma exposure, prior trauma, and preexisting mental health problems. Counseling and psychological referrals declined over time despite continuing mental health needs. Results confirm large  urban-rural disparities in access to services.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Understanding the risk factors of female infertility among child-bearing aged women, in Nanchang area. METHODS: A hospital-based matched case-control study was carried out in Nanchang. Matched by age (+/- 2 years old), 383 pairs of cases and controls were recruited  and studied. Database was established with EpiData 3.0 software. Both cases and controls were interviewed face to face, with a uniformed questionnaire. Conditional logistic regression model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis on SPSS 11.5 to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Data from multiple conditional logistic regression analysis showed that  the risk factors of infertility would include pelvic inflammatory diseases (OR =  7.078, 95% CI: 3.462-14.467), post-abortion complications' history (OR = 3.674, 95% CI: 1.690-7.986), drug treatment history (OR= 23.576,95% CI: 12.324-45.102),  dysmenorrhea (OR = 1.622, 95% CI: 1.161-2.266), pain from sexual intercourse (OR  = 2.447, 95% CI: 1.201-4.986), monthly frequency of sexual intercourse (OR = 1.416, 95% CI: 1.048-1.913) and mental stress (OR = 2.146, 95% CI: 1.662-2.771).  The protective factor of infertility, however, was level of education (OR = 0.522, 95% CI: 0.391-0.696). CONCLUSION: Prevention and treatment of pelvic infection, application of strictly controlled drugs, popularization of awareness on sexual and reproductive health and relief of mental stress would be important measures in decreasing the incidence of infertility.",0
"Every day we make choices under uncertainty; choosing what route to work or which queue in a supermarket to take, for example. It is unclear how outcome variance,  e.g. uncertainty about waiting time in a queue, affects decisions and confidence  when outcome is stochastic and continuous. How does one evaluate and choose between an option with unreliable but high expected reward, and an option with more certain but lower expected reward? Here we used an experimental design where two choices' payoffs took continuous values, to examine the effect of outcome variance on decision and confidence. We found that our participants' probability  of choosing the good (high expected reward) option decreased when the good or the bad options' payoffs were more variable. Their confidence ratings were affected by outcome variability, but only when choosing the good option. Unlike perceptual detection tasks, confidence ratings correlated only weakly with decisions' time,  but correlated with the consistency of trial-by-trial choices. Inspired by the satisficing heuristic, we propose a ""stochastic satisficing"" (SSAT) model for evaluating options with continuous uncertain outcomes. In this model, options are evaluated by their probability of exceeding an acceptability threshold, and confidence reports scale with the chosen option's thus-defined satisficing probability. Participants' decisions were best explained by an expected reward model, while the SSAT model provided the best prediction of decision confidence.  We further tested and verified the predictions of this model in a second experiment. Our model and experimental results generalize the models of metacognition from perceptual detection tasks to continuous-value based decisions. Finally, we discuss how the stochastic satisficing account of decision confidence serves psychological and social purposes associated with the evaluation, communication and justification of decision-making.",0
"The anxiety inducing paradigms such as the threat-of-shock paradigm have provided ample data on the emotional processing of predictable and unpredictable threat, but little is known about the processing of aversive, threat-irrelevant stimuli in these paradigms. We investigated how the predictability of threat influences the neural visual processing of threat-irrelevant fearful and neutral faces. Thirty-two healthy individuals participated in an NPU-threat test, consisting of a safe or neutral condition (N) and a predictable (P) as well as an unpredictable (U) threat condition, using audio-visual threat stimuli. In all NPU-conditions, we registered participants' brain responses to threat-irrelevant faces via magnetoencephalography. The data showed that increasing unpredictability of threat evoked increasing emotion regulation during face processing predominantly in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex regions during an early to mid-latency time interval. Importantly, we obtained only main effects but no significant interaction of facial expression and conditions of different threat predictability, neither in behavioral nor in neural data. Healthy individuals with average trait anxiety are thus able to maintain adaptive stimulus evaluation processes under predictable and unpredictable threat conditions.",1
"Happiness is among the most fundamental of all human goals. Although the short-term association between physical activity and happiness is well known, the long-term associations are not. Data from the National Population Health Survey cycles conducted between 1994/1995 and 2008/2009 (cycles 1 through 8) were analyzed. Happy respondents were classified as physically active or inactive at baseline and then were followed up in subsequent cycles to examine their likelihood of becoming unhappy. Individuals who changed their activity level also were examined. After controlling for potential confounding factors, the authors found that leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) was associated with reduced odds of unhappiness after 2 years and 4 years. People who were inactive in 2 consecutive cycles were more than twice as likely to be unhappy as those who remained active in both cycles after 2 years. Compared with those who became active, inactive participants who remained inactive were also more likely to become unhappy. A change in LTPA from active to inactive was associated with increased odds of becoming unhappy 2 years later. This study suggests that LTPA has a long-term association with happiness. Changes in LTPA are associated with subsequent mood status.",0
"BACKGROUND: The amygdala has been strongly implicated in the processing of threat-relevant information in specific phobia. However, there is an ongoing debate as to whether the amygdala may also be engaged outside of conscious stimulus awareness. Furthermore, considering that sustained vigilance for threat constitutes a crucial characteristic of specific phobias, we hypothesized a possible role of this symptom in modulating amygdala sensitivity to disorder-relevant cues. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined responses of the amygdala to subliminal and supraliminal phobogenic stimuli in spider-phobic subjects and whether these responses might be specifically associated with disorder-related hypervigilance. METHODS: Eighteen female spider-phobic subjects and 18 healthy female control subjects were exposed to pictures of spiders and phobia-irrelevant objects, presented briefly during two backward-masking conditions used to manipulate stimulus awareness. Brain activation data were analyzed as a function of subjects' perceptual performance on each single trial and were tested for correlations with different components of the phobic symptomatology, such as vigilance, as assessed by self-report scales. RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, phobic participants showed stronger responses of both amygdalae to consciously perceived spiders versus nonspider targets, whereas during unconscious stimulus processing, enhanced activation was only apparent in the right amygdala. Moreover, the intensity of disorder-related vigilance was positively correlated with right amygdala activation specifically during the subliminal condition. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence for unconscious threat processing in specific phobia, with the magnitude of amygdala responses specifically potentiated by sustained hypervigilance for threat. Aberrations in this vigilance system may be critically involved in anxiety disorders.",1
"BACKGROUND: Emergency departments (ED) are the first line of evaluation for patients at risk and in crisis, with or without overt suicidality (ideation, attempts). Currently employed triage and assessments methods miss some of the individuals who subsequently become suicidal. The Convergent Functional Information for Suicidality (CFI-S) 22-item checklist of risk factors, which does not ask directly about suicidal ideation, has demonstrated good predictive ability for suicidality in previous studies in psychiatrict patients but has not  been tested in the real-world setting of EDs. METHODS: We administered CFI-S prospectively to a convenience sample of consecutive ED patients. Patients were also asked at triage about suicidal thoughts or intentions per standard ED suicide clinical screening (SCS), and the  treating ED physician was asked to fill a physician gestalt visual analog scale (VAS) for likelihood of future suicidality spectrum events (SSE; ideation, preparatory acts, attempts, completed suicide). We performed structured chart review and telephone follow-up at 6 months post-index visit. RESULTS: The median time to complete the CFI-S was 3 minutes (first to third quartile = 3-6 minutes). Of the 338 patients enrolled, 45 (13.3%) were positive on the initial SCS, and 32 (9.5%) experienced a SSE in the 6 months of follow-up. Overall, SCS had modest diagnostic accuracy sensitivity 14/32 = 44%, (95% CI: 26-62%) and specificity 275/306 = 90%, (86-93%). The physician VAS also had moderate overall diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.75, confidence interval [CI] = 0.66-0.85), and the CFI-S was best (AUC = 0.81, CI = 0.76-0.87). The top CFI-S differentiating items were psychiatric illness, perceived uselessness, and social isolation. CONCLUSIONS: Using CFI-S, or some of its items, in busy EDs may help improve the  detection of patients at high risk for future suicidality.",0
"BACKGROUND: Cognitive models of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) implicate threat-related attentional biases in the etiology and phenomenology of the disorder. However, extant attentional research using reaction time (RT)-based paradigms and measures has yielded mixed results. Eye-tracking methodology has emerged in recent years to overcome several inherent drawbacks of RT-based tasks, striving to better delineate attentional processes. METHODS: A systematic review of experimental studies examining threat-related attention biases in PTSD, using eye-tracking methodology and group-comparison designs, was conducted conforming to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies were selected following a systematic search for publications between 1980 and December 2017 in PsycINFO, MEDLINE and the National Center for PTSD Research's Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress (PILOTS) database. Additional records were identified by employing the Similar Articles feature in PubMed, and the Cited Reference Search in ISI Web of Science. Reference sections of review articles, book chapters and studies selected for inclusion were searched for further studies. Ongoing studies were also sought through Clinicaltrials.gov. RESULTS: A total of 11 studies (n = 456 participants in total) were included in the final review. Results indicated little support for enhanced threat detection, hypervigilance and attentional avoidance. However, consistent evidence emerged for sustained attention on threat (i.e. attention maintenance) in PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: This review is the first to systematically evaluate extant findings in PTSD emanating from eye-tracking studies employing group-comparison designs. Results suggest that sustained attention on threat might serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.",1
"People differ in the extent to which they focus on their personal future, past, or present. Across four studies (using both correlation and experimental designs), we explore whether people also have a temporal orientation when thinking about the social groups to which they belong (i.e., their in-group). In  Studies 1-3, participants' personal temporal orientation was moderately linked with, but distinguishable from, their collective temporal orientation for their national self (i.e., 'American'). In Study 2, evidence is provided for the predictive validity of this novel concept. Specifically, greater collective past  orientation was positively associated with reported collective guilt (a group-based emotion that reflects the acceptance of culpability for historical harms perpetrated by the in-group), and greater collective future orientation focus on the in-group's future was positively associated with collective angst (a group-based emotion that reflects concern about existential threats the in-group  may face). In Study 3, collective temporal orientation was shown to differ across several groups' participants listed as self-relevant. In Study 4, participants randomly assigned to think about a past-oriented social group to which they belong reported more frequent focus on the in-group's past than participants randomly assigned to think about a future-oriented in-group (and vice versa for collective future focus). This research advances the literature on time perspective by showing that temporal cognition extends to the social self.",0
"Feelings of uncontrollability and anxiety regarding possibly harmful events are key features of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology. Due to a lack of studies, the neural correlates of anticipatory anxiety in PTSD are still poorly understood. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, female PTSD patients with interpersonal violence trauma and healthy controls (HC) anticipated the temporally unpredictable presentation of aversive (human scream) or neutral sounds. Based on separate analysis models, we investigated phasic and sustained brain activations. PTSD patients reported increased anxiety during anticipation of aversive versus neutral sounds. Furthermore, we found both increased initial, phasic amygdala activation and increased sustained activation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) during anticipation of aversive versus neutral sounds in PTSD patients in comparison to HC. PTSD patients as compared with HC also showed increased phasic responses in mid-cingulate cortex (MCC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), mid-insula and lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) as well as increased sustained responses in MCC, PCC, anterior insula and lateral and medial PFC. Our results demonstrate a relationship between anticipatory anxiety in PTSD patients and hyperresponsiveness of brain regions that have previously been associated with PTSD symptomatology. Additionally, the dissociation between amygdala and BNST indicates distinct temporal and functional characteristics and suggests that phasic fear and sustained anxiety responses are enhanced during unpredictable anticipation of aversive stimuli in PTSD.

"Massage therapy promotes psychosocial relaxation, reduces stress and has been reported to improve the immune function. As such, massage therapy is currently used in palliative care for the relief of anxiety and pain. Although psychosocial status has been evaluated using subjective psychological tests, such as State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), subjective psychological tests are of limited value if the subjects fail to report reliably. Salivary biomarkers have been recently suggested as useful objective markers for assessing psychosocial status. To determine whether salivary biomarkers are useful objective indices for assessing the effects of back massage on the mental status of 25 young healthy female volunteers, we measured heart rate and salivary biomarkers (α-amylase activity, cortisol, and chromogranin A) and assessed the STAI score before and after the back massage. Back massage significantly reduced the heart rate and STAI; however, salivary amylase and cortisol levels did not change. In contrast,  the level of salivary chromogranin A significantly increased. We therefore conclude that changes in the salivary biomarkers tested here may not indicate changes in psychological status following massage therapy. However, the increase  in chromogranin A release may contribute to the immunologically beneficial effects of massage therapy as chromogranin A has antibacterial and antifungal activity.",0
"This study examined discrepancies between 4- and 7-year-olds' (n = 135; Mage = 5.65) self-reported affect following hypothetical moral versus social-conventional transgressions and their associations with teacher-rated physical and relational aggression concurrently and 9-months later. Negative emotion ratings in response to prototypical moral transgressions were not associated with children's aggression. When transgressions were described as no longer prohibited by rules and authority figures, children reporting more negative affect in response to moral as compared to conventional violations were less physically aggressive at Wave 1 and showed relative and mean-level declines in physical aggression over time. Relational aggression was not associated with self-reported emotions. Findings indicate the importance of distinguishing between types of transgressions and forms of aggression in studying moral emotions.",1
"For people with type 1 diabetes, extensive tasks involved in diabetes self-management have a significant impact on overall care and quality of life. Members of the working population with type 1 diabetes spend one third of their time at work, yet little attention has been paid to challenges specific to balancing diabetes management and work life. Diabetes is associated with increased absenteeism and presenteeism, as well as disability retirement and lower lifetime income. These quantitative outcomes are corroborated by qualitative studies highlighting some of the challenges of reconciling diabetes self-management with work life. This qualitative study expands on previous research by examining illness behavior in work life using Alonzo's concept of containment. Forty in-depth interviews with Danish people with type 1 diabetes were conducted from May to December 2016 and analyzed using abductive reasoning.  We found that working people with type 1 diabetes live in tension between competing logics linked to diabetes and to work life. We illustrate how diabetes  management can be articulated as a matter of containment, which refers to the assemblage of practices and mental and emotional work required to keep diabetes at the level of a side-involvement and maintain proper situational involvement in work life. The containment framework illuminates and characterizes diabetes management in the context of work life and reveals a hidden burden of disease carried by working people with type 1 diabetes. Further research is needed to advance the theory of containment.",0
"Dispositional trait frameworks offer great potential to elucidate the nature and development of psychopathology, including the construct of relational aggression. The present study sought to explore the dispositional context of relational aggression across three dispositional frameworks: temperament, personality, and personality pathology. Participants comprised a large community sample of youth, aged 6 to 18 years (N = 1,188; 51.2% female). Ratings of children's relational aggression, temperament, personality, and personality pathology traits were obtained through parent report (86.3% mothers). Results showed convergence and divergence across these three dispositional frameworks. Like other antisocial behavior subtypes, relational aggression generally showed connections with traits reflecting negative emotionality and poor self-regulation. Relational aggression showed stronger connections with temperament traits than with personality traits, suggesting that temperament frameworks may capture more relationally aggressive content. Findings at the lower order trait level help differentiate relational aggression from other externalizing problems by providing a more nuanced perspective (e.g., both sociability and shyness positively predicted relational aggression). In addition, there was little evidence of moderation of these associations by gender, age, or age2, and findings remained robust even after controlling for physical aggression. Results are discussed in the broader context of conceptualizing relational aggression in an overarching personality-psychopathology framework.",1
"This study investigated the joint effects of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system reactivity to social and non-social stressors on proactive (i.e., goal-directed, unemotional) and reactive (i.e., emotional, impulsive) functions of relational aggression. Two hundred and forty-seven (Mage=18.77years) participants completed a series of stressor tasks while their sympathetic arousal (i.e., skin conductance) and parasympathetic arousal (i.e., respiratory sinus arrhythmia) were assessed. Participants also provided self-reports of their aggressive behavior. In the standardized social stressor only, physiological reactivity was related to aggression, such that respiratory sinus arrhythmia augmentation predicted proactive relational aggression whereas heightened skin conductance reactivity predicted reactive relational aggression. Finally, in the context of low skin conductance reactivity, respiratory sinus arrhythmia augmentation was related to heightened proactive and reactive aggression, whereas respiratory sinus arrhythmia withdrawal was protective. Results suggest that the benefits hypothesized to accompany respiratory sinus arrhythmia withdrawal may only occur among individuals with low ""fight or flight"" stress responses. Findings extend research on the physiological indicators of aggression to relational aggression, and highlight the importance of assessing functions of aggression, as well as physiological reactivity to multiple stressors.",1
"Distinguishing between relational and physical aggression has become a key feature of many developmental studies in North America and Western Europe, but very little information is available on relational and physical aggression in more diverse cultural contexts. This study examined the factor structure of, associations between, and gender differences in relational and physical aggression in China, Colombia, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, the Philippines, Sweden, Thailand, and the United States. Children ages 7-10 years (N = 1,410) reported on their relationally and physically aggressive behavior. Relational and physical aggression shared a common factor structure across countries. In all nine countries, relational and physical aggression were significantly correlated (average r = .49). Countries differed in the mean levels of both relational and physical aggression that children reported using and with respect to whether children reported using more physical than relational aggression or more relational than physical aggression. Boys reported being more physically aggressive than girls across all nine countries; no consistent gender differences emerged in relational aggression. Despite mean-level differences in relational and physical aggression across countries, the findings provided support for cross-country similarities in associations between relational and physical aggression as well as links between gender and aggression.",1
"BACKGROUND: Data from the World Health Organization shows obesity has more than doubled worldwide since 1980. Childhood obesity is mainly associated with external and modifiable factors, as eating habits, existing room for promoting healthy lifestyles. Additionally, learning can take place in contexts other than  schools, as the hospital, potentiating the time of hospitalization. Self-regulated learning framework is suited to train the skills necessary for self-management processes and behavioral changes. The aim was to describe and evaluate a campaign designed to increase knowledge about healthy eating by hospitalized school-aged youth. METHOD: A quasi-experimental design was used. Participants were randomly distributed between the experimental and control groups, each one with 15 participants aged between six and 16 years-old. Information about healthy eating  was not provided directly; participants had to reflect and work to build knowledge through activities inspired in the self-regulated learning framework. RESULTS: Results showed that the experimental group when compared with their counterparts significantly improved their knowledge on healthy eating after taking part in the campaign. CONCLUSIONS: Campaigns that increase knowledge on healthy eating based on the promotion of self-regulated learning strategies could be incorporated in health promotion programs not only in pediatric units but also in other educational contexts.",0
"The human brain has the impressive capacity to adapt how it processes information to high-level goals. While it is known that these cognitive control skills are malleable and can be improved through training, the underlying plasticity mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we develop and evaluate a model of how  people learn when to exert cognitive control, which controlled process to use, and how much effort to exert. We derive this model from a general theory according to which the function of cognitive control is to select and configure neural pathways so as to make optimal use of finite time and limited computational resources. The central idea of our Learned Value of Control model is that people use reinforcement learning to predict the value of candidate control signals of different types and intensities based on stimulus features. This model correctly predicts the learning and transfer effects underlying the adaptive control-demanding behavior observed in an experiment on visual attention and four experiments on interference control in Stroop and Flanker paradigms. Moreover, our model explained these findings significantly better than an associative learning model and a Win-Stay Lose-Shift model. Our findings elucidate how learning and experience might shape people's ability and propensity to adaptively control their minds and behavior. We conclude by predicting under which circumstances these learning mechanisms might lead to self-control failure.",0
"In 1972, a British charity, Relaxation for Living, was established ""to promote the teaching of physical relaxation, to combat stress, strain, anxiety and the tension of modern life, and to reduce fatigue"". This article explores the origins and development of ""physical relaxation"" techniques and ideologies, starting in the interwar period, and the development of practical, therapeutic, social and cultural frameworks necessary for such an organization to come into being in 1970s Britain. It traces how relaxation was reconstituted as a scientifically-based skill that could be learnt and taught, imbued with therapeutic value for combating and preventing specific physical ailments and enhancing individual health and wellbeing. The article explores how relaxation techniques gained currency among particular demographic and clinical groups, ranging from middle-class, child-bearing women to middle-aged, ""coronary-prone"" men. This analysis highlights the role that relaxation practitioners played in both creating and responding to demand for individualistic health-management strategies, many of which have shaped contemporary health and wellbeing agendas.  This article is published as part of a collection entitled ""On balance: lifestyle, mental health and wellbeing"".",0
"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported changes within grey matter (GM) volume in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, little is known about GM volume changes and the relation with symptom severity in Chinese boys with low functioning autism spectrum disorder (LFASD). METHOD: GM volume was analysed using SPM 8 and compared between 16 boys with LFASD as well as 16 typically developing (TD) boys (using REST 1.8). Additionally, the correlation between GM volume and clinical symptoms was analysed, using subscales within the Autism Behaviour Checklist (ABC). RESULTS: The comparison showed a reduced volume of GM in 11 clusters in the boys  with LFASD (i.e., the left inferior frontal gyrus, orbital part; right superior temporal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, dorsolateral; precuneus and postcentral;  bilateral rectus and middle temporal gyrus) and 1 area with increased GM volume (right caudate) compared to the TD group. Additionally, the GM volume of the left inferior frontal gyrus, orbital part was negatively correlated with the Social subscale score of the ABC (r = -0.765, P = 0.002), and the GM volume of the left  Rectus was negatively associated with the Language, Body concept and Self-care subscale scores and the total score on the ABC(r = -0.624, P = 0.023; r = -0.657, P = 0.011; r = -0.618, P = 0.025; r = -0.625, P = 0.022). Further, the GM volume  of the right Caudate was negatively correlated with the Sensory subscale on the ABC (r = -0.593, P = 0.033). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the current study's findings display that the GM volume was widely reduced in Chinese boys with LFASD compared to TD boys and negatively correlated with the clinical symptoms, indicating a possible pathological mechanism of LFASD.",0
"The current study investigates whether established associations between physical aggression and low autonomic nervous system arousal, as indexed by heart rate and blood pressure, also apply to the study of the development of relational aggression. Baseline heart rate and blood pressure were collected in two samples of preschoolers, and teachers reported on classroom physical and relational aggression. In Study 1, lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure were related to increased engagement in relational aggression among older preschoolers. In Study 2, lower heart rate and blood pressure predicted increased engagement in classroom physical and relational aggression concurrently and across a preschool year in some cases. Low baseline arousal-aggression associations were strongest for children with poorer self-regulation abilities, whereas high self-regulation appeared to protect children with low heart rate and blood pressure from engagement in aggressive classroom behavior. These findings suggest the utility of examining baseline physiological measures in the study of relational aggression as well as physical aggression. Implications for interventions targeted to physical and relational aggression in early childhood are discussed.",1
"This study explored several factors associated with expected outcome of emotional expression and likelihood of expression among children. These variables were posited to be a reflection of children's affective display rules. Differences in  outcome expectancies and likelihood of expression were assessed as a function of  sex of parent, sex of subject, grade, and type of affect. 125 first-, fourth-, and sixth-grade children (mean ages, 6-9, 9-2, and 11-7, respectively) were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 experimental conditions involving either sad or angry affect inductions. Older boys reported less positive expectancies and lower likelihood of expression than younger boys; and boys had less positive expectancies and lower likelihood of expression for sadness than girls. A high correlation was obtained between outcome expectancy and likelihood of expression; the correlation was higher for sadness than anger, and higher among males than females. These results suggest that socialization practices tend to be directed toward the suppression of sadness among males.",0
"The present article examined the development of relational aggression in middle childhood and the effects of observed teacher behavior on this development. Relying on social learning theory, we expected that teacher praise would slow down the increase of relational aggression, whereas teacher reprimands would promote the increase of relational aggression. A sample of 570 children (49% boys, Mage=7years and 5months, >95% Belgian) was followed from second to fourth grade. Teacher praise and reprimands were observed at the beginning of second grade. Child relational aggression was assessed using teacher and peer reports, collected at five points in time: at the beginning and end of the second grade, at the beginning and end of the third grade, and at the end of the fourth grade. Multilevel modeling showed that relational aggression generally increased from second to fourth grade. Moreover, when teachers displayed more praise, students' relational aggression increased at a slower rate; when teachers displayed more reprimands, students' relational aggression increased at a faster rate. Overall, the results stress the importance of supporting teachers to reduce reprimands and increase praise when interacting with children.",1
"The present study investigated the longitudinal relationships between physical and relational aggression and later drug use, as moderated by gender. Self-reported data were gathered from 2064 high school students at pretest and 1-year post-test to test the hypotheses that (1) males would engage in more physical aggression than females, whereas females would engage in more relational aggression than males; and (2) physical aggression would be a stronger drug use predictor for males and relational aggression a stronger predictor for females. Results indicated that males reported engaging in more physical aggression than females at baseline; however, females and males reported engaging in similar rates of relational aggression. After controlling for relational aggression, baseline drug use, and demographic variables, physical aggression at baseline was found to predict alcohol use 1-year later for males but not for females. After controlling for physical aggression, baseline drug use, and demographic variables, relational aggression was found to predict cigarette use and marijuana use for females but not for males. However, relational aggression was found to predict later alcohol and hard drug equally across gender. These findings suggest that both physical and relational aggression are predictive of subsequent drug use and have important implications for violence and drug use prevention intervention efforts.",1
"Existing literature exemplifies the relationship between alcohol and overt aggression, especially for adult males. Less clear is the relationship between alcohol and aggression among male and female college students, in particular, the nature of this aggression and the co-occurrence of drinking and aggression on the same day (temporal proximity). This study examines the chronic and temporal nature of males' and females' alcohol-related aggression among college students. Two hundred fourteen students completed a web-based 7-day event-level survey measuring alcohol consumption and perpetration of physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger, and relational aggression over 4 weeks, resulting in 4,256 observations (days). The global analysis revealed students who are heavy drinkers are more likely to perpetrate all four forms of aggression, whereas the event-level analysis revealed that specific forms of aggression are associated with drinking at the time, while other forms were not linked to drinking occasions. Cross-tabulation revealed males and females were more likely to use verbal and physical aggression when drinking. For females, drinking was also associated with relational aggression and anger. Despite often being overlooked in research on aggression during emerging adulthood, relational aggression was prevalent. Discrepancies between the global and temporal analysis revealed factors other than alcohol might explain the relationship between chronic alcohol consumption and specific forms of aggression. This is one of the first event-level studies to show the temporal relationship between alcohol and relational aggression. The distinctions in the current study, exemplifying the diversity of alcohol-related aggression, are critical for understanding aggressive behavior, potential gender differences, and for developing interventions. The temporal relationship between alcohol and aggression suggests health interventions should target drinking and aggression simultaneously.",1
"This study examined the outcome of elective shoulder arthroplasty for glenohumeral osteoarthritis or rotator cuff arthropathy in patients aged older than 90 years. The study included 7 shoulders in 6 patients with an average age of 93 years 5 months, (range, 91 years 0 months to 97 years 4 months). Average follow-up was 2.2 years, (range, 1-4 years). Preoperative range of motion, Simple Shoulder Test (SST) scores, and Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36-Item Health  Survey (SF-36) scores were obtained and compared with postoperative values at 3 and 6 months and yearly thereafter. Average forward elevation improved from 87 degrees to 137 degrees (P < .00001), and external rotation to the side improved from 0 degrees to 50 degrees (P < .0001). The SST scores improved from a preoperative average of 2.0 to 6.1 at 3 months (P < .0001), 6.9 at 6 months (P <  .0001), 8.0 at 1 year (P < .00001), and 7.4 at 2 years (P < .0001). Significant improvements occurred in 6 of 8 SF-36 domains: Mental Health (P < .05), Vitality  (P < .01), Role limitations due to emotional problems (P < .05), Social Function  (P < .001), Role limitations due to physical health (P < .001), and Comfort (P <  .00001). No patient had worse pain or function postoperatively. These data suggest that elective shoulder arthroplasty can be performed in patients 90 years of age and older, providing excellent pain relief, improved functional outcome, and enhanced general health status.",0

"PURPOSE: The principal excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate plays an important role in many central nervous system disorders. Because glutamate resides predominantly in glutamatergic neurons, its relaxation properties reflect the intracellular environment of glutamatergic neurons. This study developed an improved echo time-independent technique for measuring transverse relaxation time and demonstrated that this radio frequency (RF)-driven longitudinal steady state  technique can reliably measure glutamate transverse relaxation in the frontal cortex, where structural and functional abnormalities have been associated with psychiatric symptoms. METHOD: Bloch and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to improve and optimize  the RF-driven, longitudinal, steady-state (MARzss) technique to significantly shorten scan time and increase measurement precision. Optimized four-flip angle measurements at 0°,12°, 24°, and 36° with matched repetition time were used in nine human subjects (6F, 3M; 27-49 years old) at 7 Tesla. Longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates for glutamate were measured from a 2 x 2 x 2 cm3 voxel placed in three different brain regions: gray matter-dominated medial prefrontal lobe, white matter-dominated left frontal lobe, and gray matter-dominated occipital lobe. RESULTS: Compared to the original MARzss technique, the scan time per voxel for measuring glutamate transverse relaxation was shortened by more than 50%. In the  medial frontal, left frontal, and occipital voxels, the glutamate T2 was found to be 117.5±12.9 ms (mean ± standard deviation, n = 9), 107.3±12.1 (n = 9), and 124.4±16.6 ms (n = 8), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The improvements described in this study make the MARZSS technique a viable tool for reliably measuring glutamate relaxation from human subjects in a  typical clinical setting. It is expected that this improved technique can be applied to characterize the intracellular environment of glutamatergic neurons in a variety of brain disorders.",0
"BACKGROUND: Although males more frequently develop Internet gaming disorder (IGD) as compared with females, few studies have examined gender-related neurocognitive differences in IGD. TASK AND DESIGN: fMRI and subjective data were collected from 119 subjects (IGD, male 29, female 25; recreational game use (RGU), male 34, female 31) when they were actively playing games and during a forced mandatory break. Analyses investigating effects of group (IGD, RGU) and gender (male, female) on the functional connectivity (FC) of executive control and reward systems linked to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and striatum, respectively, were performed. Correlations between FC and subjective craving measures were also calculated. RESULTS: Gaming-group-by-gender interactions were observed. During gaming in males but not in females, the FC between the DLPFC and superior frontal gyrus was relatively decreased, and that between the striatum and thalamus was relatively increased. During the mandatory break, changes in the FC between DLPFC and superior frontal gyrus and the FC between the striatum and thalamus varied by gender with greater RGU-IGD differences observed in females. Significant correlations between FC and self-reported craving were observed. CONCLUSIONS: During both gaming and a forced mandatory break, brain regions implicated in executive control and reward processing showed changes in FC that varied by gender. Brain regions implicated in executive control showed differential FC in males during gaming, and FC during the forced mandatory break  appeared relevant to both genders, and perhaps particularly for females. The findings suggest possible neural mechanisms for why males appear more likely to develop IGD, and why it may be particularly difficult for individuals with IGD to cease gaming.",0
"Research conducted over the last decade has documented both the high rates of and serious consequences associated with both victimization and perpetration of relational aggression. This study examines risk for involvement in relational aggression and victimization among middle school youth, evaluating both individual beliefs about violence, as well as aspects of the school environment, including interpersonal school climate and school responsiveness to violence. A sample of 5,625 primarily urban minority middle school youth (49.2 % female) participating in a violence prevention project completed measures of relational aggression and victimization as well as indicators of individual beliefs about aggression, school norms for aggression, student-teacher and student-student interpersonal climate, and school responsiveness to violence. Unlike results previously found for physical aggression, no school-level indicator of climate was related to relational aggression or victimization. However, individual beliefs about aggression and individual perceptions of the school environment were related strongly to both the perpetration of and victimization by relational aggression. These results suggest not only that individual beliefs and perceptions of the school environment are important in understanding perpetration and victimization of relational aggression, but also that risk for involvement in relational aggression is distinct from that of physical aggression. Implications for school interventions are discussed, as well as suggestions for future research.",1
"PURPOSE: To understand the experience of drug-resistant epilepsy in patients from Argentina, a developing nation. METHOD: A qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews was used to gain  an in-depth and contextual understanding of the perspectives of 20 patients with  DRE. Data collection and analysis were followed by an inductive and interpretive  approach informed by the principles of thematic analysis. RESULTS: Six main themes emerged: 1) Characteristics of the illness, including seizure features -unpredictability, presence of auras, physical and cognitive consequences- and how patients relate with the use of antiepileptic drugs; 2) interactions with health system, regarding the features of the Argentine's health system, and patient's health-seeking behaviours; 3) beliefs about the illness, including psychosocial, biological and folk explanatory models; 4) beliefs about  how other people perceive them, which included prejudice, responsibility and overprotection; 5) self-perception, and 6) impact of the illness on their activities. CONCLUSIONS: This information might be useful to help in the development of a conceptual model of the impact epilepsy on patients' lives. Many of the topics mentioned as relevant in Argentina coincide with those highlighted in studies that were carried out in first-world countries. However, additional topics were also reported including the role of traditional healing in health-seeking behaviour and explanatory models of illness. It is important to understand these  perspectives to develop appropriate psychosocial interventions for this specific  population.",0
"This research examined the moderating effect of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) on the associations between relational victimization and reactive and proactive relational aggression. Both branches of the ANS, the parasympathetic nervous system (indexed by respiratory sinus arrhythmia reactivity; RSA-Reactivity) and the sympathetic nervous system (indexed by skin conductance level reactivity; SCL-Reactivity), were examined. Emerging adults (N = 168) self-reported on relational victimization and proactive and reactive relational aggression; RSA-Reactivity and SCL-Reactivity were assessed in response to a laboratory stressor. Relational victimization predicted heightened reactive relational aggression given RSA augmentation/high SCL-Reactivity (i.e., coactivation) and RSA withdrawal/low SCL-Reactivity (i.e., coinhibition). In addition, relational victimization predicted heightened reactive relational aggression given RSA augmentation/low SCL-Reactivity (i.e., reciprocal parasympathetic activation). This study extends previous research on relational victimization and provides novel evidence that (a) exposure to relational victimization is associated with reactive relational aggression, but not proactive relational aggression, and (b) parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system reactivity jointly moderate the link between relational victimization and reactive relational aggression.",1
"Decision-makers benefit from information only when they can use it to guide behavior. However, recent experiments found that pigeons and starlings value information that they cannot use. Here we show that this paradox is also present  in rats, and explore the underlying decision process. Subjects chose between two  options that delivered food probabilistically after a fixed delay. In one option  (""info""), outcomes (food/no-food) were signaled immediately after choice, whereas in the alternative (""non-info"") the outcome was uncertain until the delay lapsed. Rats sacrificed up to 20% potential rewards by preferring the info option, but reversed preference when the cost was 60%. This reversal contrasts with the results found with pigeons and starlings and may reflect species' differences worth of further investigation. Results are consistent with predictions of the Sequential Choice Model (SCM), that proposes that choices are driven by the mechanisms that control action in sequential encounters. As expected from the SCM, latencies to respond in single-option trials predicted preferences in choice trials, and latencies in choice trials were the same or shorter than in single-option trials. We argue that the congruence of results in distant vertebrates probably reflects evolved adaptations to shared fundamental challenges in nature, and that the apparently paradoxical overvaluing of information is not sub-optimal as has been claimed, even though its functional significance is not yet understood.",0
"The question of whether there is a connection between income and psychological well-being is a long-studied issue across the social, psychological, and behavioral sciences. Much research has found that richer people tend to be happier. However, relatively little attention has been paid to whether happier individuals perform better financially in the first place. This possibility of reverse causality is arguably understudied. Using data from a large US representative panel, we show that adolescents and young adults who report higher life satisfaction or positive affect grow up to earn significantly higher levels  of income later in life. We focus on earnings approximately one decade after the  person's well-being is measured; we exploit the availability of sibling clusters  to introduce family fixed effects; we account for the human capacity to imagine later socioeconomic outcomes and to anticipate the resulting feelings in current  well-being. The study's results are robust to the inclusion of controls such as education, intelligence quotient, physical health, height, self-esteem, and later happiness. We consider how psychological well-being may influence income. Sobel-Goodman mediation tests reveal direct and indirect effects that carry the influence from happiness to income. Significant mediating pathways include a higher probability of obtaining a college degree, getting hired and promoted, having higher degrees of optimism and extraversion, and less neuroticism.",0
"In a longitudinal study with N = 1,854 adolescents from Germany, we investigated patterns of change and gender differences in physical and relational aggression in relation to normative beliefs about these two forms of aggression. Participants, whose mean age was 13 years at T1, completed self-report measures of physically and relationally aggressive behavior and indicated their normative approval of both forms of aggression at four data waves separated by 12-month intervals. Boys scored higher than did girls on both forms of aggression, but the gender difference was more pronounced for physical aggression. Physical aggression decreased and relational aggression increased over the four data waves in both gender groups. The normative acceptance of both forms of aggression decreased over time, with a greater decrease for the approval of physical aggression. In both gender groups, normative approval of relational aggression prospectively predicted relational aggression across all data waves, and the normative approval of physical aggression predicted physically aggressive behavior at the second and third data waves. A reciprocal reinforcement of aggressive norms and behavior was found for both forms of aggression. The findings are discussed as supporting a social information processing perspective on developmental patterns of change in physical and relational aggression in adolescence.",1
"Performing multiple tasks either simultaneously, in rapid alternation or in succession, is routine in daily life. Further, testing rodents in a battery of tests is common both in drug discovery and behavioral phenotyping research. However, learning of new tasks can be influenced by prior experience(s). There has been some research on 'switching cost' involved in the transition from one behavior to another. However, there has been no specific assessment of the effect of learning an operant paradigm on performance in a spatial memory task and vice  versa. Accordingly, we evaluated task switching between two forms of learning paradigms, operant conditioning and radial arm maze (RAM) tasks. In experiment 1, rats were trained for operant conditioning with food reward followed by a partially baited RAM task. In experiment 2, rats were trained first on a RAM task followed by operant learning. Pre-training on the operant task, impaired the acquisition of the RAM. On the contrary, pre-training on the RAM enhanced operant performance. Our study reveals significant effects of the test order on task-switching in rats. This knowledge can be useful when framing test sequences  in test batteries for drug discovery research and screening genetically modified  mice.",0
"Hyperactive children (N = 15) and nonhyperactive children (N = 15) were compared. Hyperactive children were found to possess significantly higher (p less than .002) muscular tension levels and, in addition, presented more behavioral problems and had lower test scores. Both electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback and  progressive relaxation exercises were successful in the significant reduction of  muscular tension, hyperactivity, distractability, irritability, impulsivity, explosiveness, aggressivity, and emotionality in hyperactive children. The greatest improvement was seen in the area of ""emotionality-aggression"" (irritability, explosiveness, impulsivity, low frustration tolerance, aggresion). No differences were seen in the EMG improvement of drug and nondrug hyperactive children; both made progress under these self-control techniques. However, nondrug children made greater improvements in the behavioral area. Both EMG biofeedback and progressive relaxation resulted in improvements on the test scores of hyperactive subjects (Bender-Gestalt, Visual Sequential Memory, Digit Span, Coding). The therapy would appear to be improved by the inclusion of mental relaxation, concentration, meditation, and mind-blanking exercises for mental control.",0
"(1) Background: Several researches have shown the relationship between healthy habits and physical and mental health. Thus, it is essential to study how some psychosocial factors can promote positive behaviours in university students, specifically in those who will be teachers of Physical Education. (2) Methods: This descriptive and cross-sectional research was conducted on 775 university students of Physical Education from Spain. This study aims to develop an explanatory model for the relationships between motivational climate, healthy habits (Mediterranean Diet (MD), Physical Activity (PA) and substance consumption) and some indicators of physical health (oxygen consumption (VO2MAX)) and mental health (self-concept) according to gender, using structural equations  analysis. (3) Results: The motivational climate was positively associated with PA, showing a stronger relationship for ego-oriented climate in women. The adherence to MD showed a positive association with PA and self-concept, while it  is negative for the consumption of tobacco in men. Likewise, PA was directly related to VO2MAX with a higher regression weight for women. The ego-oriented motivational climate was negatively related to tobacco consumption in women. (4)  Conclusions: Task-oriented goals are related to more positive and healthy behaviours such as PA, although it was no association was found with MD. Therefore, we can conclude the importance of promoting task-oriented goals in educational contexts linked to Physical Education in order to avoid negative behaviours.",0
"BACKGROUND: Prior work has indicated both theoretical and empirical overlap between social and physical aggression. The extent to which their covariance can be explained by the same underlying genetic or environmental factors, however, remains unclear. It is also uncertain whether or how the origins of their covariance might vary across sex. The current study sought to fill these gaps in the literature. METHODS: We examined maternal and teacher reports of youth physical and social aggression in over 1000 6-10 years old (mean age = 8.02 years) twin pairs from the Michigan State University Twin Registry. We made use of the bivariate correlated factors model to clarify the origins of their association. We further tested both sex difference and no-sex difference versions of that model to determine whether there are sex differences in the association between social and physical aggression, as often assumed. RESULTS: The covariation between social and physical aggression was due to overlapping genetic factors and common environmental conditions. Specifically, 50-57% of the genetic factors, 74-100% of the shared environmental factors, and 28-40% of the unique environmental factors influencing physical aggression also influenced social aggression according to both mother and teacher reports. These shared etiological factors did not differ across sex. CONCLUSIONS: These findings argue against the common assumption that social aggression is the 'female version' of male physical aggression, and instead suggest that social aggression may be best conceptualized as a form of antisocial behavior that shares developmental pathways with other manifestations of externalizing pathology.",1
"Researchers have debated whether relational aggression is a developmentally-normative behavior or a sign of some underlying psychopathology. However, due to the dearth of longitudinal studies, we know little about how relational aggression and more severe forms of disruptive behavior co-develop. The present study examined bidirectional associations between relational aggression and two psychiatric disorders, Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and Conduct Disorder (CD), using data from a longitudinal study of 674 Mexican-origin youth followed from age 10 to 16. Results showed that individuals who engaged in relational aggression tended to increase over time in ODD and CD symptoms, and conversely, individuals exhibiting symptoms of ODD and CD tended to increase in relational aggression. These findings held for boys and girls, for youth born in Mexico and the U.S., and after controlling for physical aggression. Thus, relational aggression seems to be both a developmentally-normative behavior and a predictor of future mental health problems.",1
"Uncertain reward outcomes are characterised by statistical parameters that capture the numerical values of the underlying probability distributions of reward values, including the expected value, risk (variance) and probability. Here we show coding of an integrated expected value signal by single orbitofrontal neurons in response to visual cues predicting uncertain rewards. Separate subpopulations of orbitofrontal neurons predominantly code the prediction of one statistical parameter with few neurons showing combined coding. These signals are likely combined with subjective value signals to inform learning and decision making under conditions of uncertainty.",0
"Unlike the overt nature of physical aggression, which lends itself to simpler and more direct methods of investigation, the often-masked nature of relational aggression has led to difficulties and debate regarding the most effective tools of study. Given concerns with the accuracy of third-party relational aggression reports, especially as individuals age, self-report measures may be particularly useful when assessing experiences with relational aggression. However, it is important to recognize validity concerns-in particular, the potential effects of item order presentation-associated with self-report of relational aggression perpetration and victimization. To investigate this issue, surveys were administered and completed by 179 young adults randomly assigned to one of four survey conditions reflecting manipulation of item order. Survey conditions included presentation of (a) perpetration items only, (b) victimization items only, (c) perpetration items followed by victimization items, and (d) victimization items followed by perpetration items. Results revealed that participants reported perpetrating relational aggression significantly more often when asked only about perpetration or when asked about perpetration before victimization, compared with participants who were asked about victimization before perpetration. Item order manipulation did not result in significant differences in self-reported victimization experiences. Results of this study indicate a need for greater consideration of item order when conducting research using self-report data and the importance of additional investigation into which form of item presentation elicits the most accurate self-report information.",1
"Background The previously validated Healthy Heart Score effectively predicted the 20-year risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We examine whether the Healthy Heart Score may extend to an association with total and cause-specific mortality. Methods and results The prospective cohort study investigated 58 319 women (mean  age 50.2 years) in the Nurses' Health Study (1984-2010) and 29 854 in men (mean age 52.7 years) in the Health Professionals' Follow-up Study (1986-2010) free of  cancer and CVD at baseline. The Healthy Heart Score included baseline current smoking; high body mass index; low physical activity; no or excessive alcohol intake; low intake of fruits and vegetables, cereal fiber, or nuts; and high intake of sugar-sweetened beverages or red/processed meats. There were 19 122 total deaths. Compared with participants in the first quintile of the Healthy Heart Score (lowest CVD risk), participants in the fifth quintile (highest CVD risk) had a pooled hazard ratio of 2.26 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.53-3.33) for total mortality; 2.85 (95 % CI, 1.92-4.23) for CVD mortality, and 2.14 (95% CI, 1.56-2.95) for cancer mortality. Participants in the fifth versus the first quintile also had significantly greater risk of death due to coronary heart disease (3.37; 95% CI, 2.16-5.25), stroke (1.75; 95% CI, 1.02-2.99), lung cancer  (6.04; 95% CI, 2.78-13.13), breast cancer (1.45; 95% CI, 1.14-1.86), and colon cancer (1.51; 95% CI, 1.18-1.93). Conclusions The Healthy Heart Score, composed of 9 self-reported, modifiable lifestyle predictors of CVD, is a potentially useful tool for the counseling of healthy lifestyles that was strongly associated with greater risk of all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality.",0
"Introduction  Allergic rhinitis is one of the most common allergic diseases that  cause a decrease in quality of life. Over the last decades, the increase in the number of cases is supposed to be a result of industrialization and lifestyle changes. Vitamin D, which is a steroid hormone, has a significant immunomodulatory and antioxidant role in the human body. Objective  The objective of the present study is to investigate the role of 1α-25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels in allergic rhinitis patients and to compare them to the levels found in the healthy population. Methods  A total of 256 participants were included in the present study. Allergic rhinitis is diagnosed with the help of the Allergic Rhinitis and Its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) guidelines confirmed through skin prick  tests. Control subjects were selected among people without allergy history, which was also confirmed through skin prick tests. The levels of 1α-25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, immunoglobulin E (IgE), and eosinophil counts were measured in blood samples  from both groups. Results  The mean value of serum levels of 1α-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was 25.5 ± 3.74 in the allergic rhinitis group, and 31.58 ± 3.85 in the control subjects. This difference reveals statistically-decreased levels in the allergic rhinitis group ( p  < 0.05). The total IgE levels are increased in the allergic rhinitis group ( p  < 0.05) and negatively correlated with the serum levels of 1α-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (r = - 0.259, p  < 0.05). Conclusion  Lower serum levels of 1α-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 were detected in the allergic rhinitis population. This data is also correlated to the IgE response in the study group.  A supplement of 1α-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in deficient patients might be helpful to relieve symptoms and signs of allergic rhinitis, but further studies are needed.",0
"This article describes the circumstances under which women may develop insomnia and the various treatment options, including hypnotic medication and nonpharmacologic approaches. The efficacy and safety of these treatments are reviewed. The choice of treatment depends on the nature of the insomnia, the stage of a woman's life, the presence of medical or mental health conditions, the availability of treatments, and personal preference. For immediate, short-term relief of acute insomnia, hypnotic medication, especially the nonbenzodiazepines  (zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone) are options. For chronic insomnia, insomnia-specific cognitive and behavioral therapies are generally the interventions of choice.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Benign and malignant tumors of the spine significantly impair the function and quality of life of many patients. Standard treatment options, including conventional radiotherapy and surgery, are often limited by anatomic constraints and previous treatment. Image-guided stereotactic radiosurgery using  the CyberKnife system (Accuray, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) is a novel approach in the multidisciplinary management of spinal tumors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery on pain and quality-of-life outcomes of patients with spinal tumors. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 200 patients with benign or malignant spinal tumors treated at Georgetown University Hospital between March 2002 and September 2006. Patients were treated by means of multisession stereotactic radiosurgery using the CyberKnife as initial treatment, postoperative treatment, or retreatment. Pain scores were assessed by the Visual  Analog Scale, quality of life was assessed by the SF-12 survey, and neurological  examinations were conducted after treatment. RESULTS: Mean pain scores decreased significantly from 40.1 to 28.6 after treatment (P < 0.001) and continued to decrease over the entire 4-year follow-up  period (P < 0.05). SF-12 Physical Component scores demonstrated no significant change throughout the follow-up period. Mental Component scores were significantly higher after treatment (P < 0.01), representing a quality-of-life improvement. Early side effects of radiosurgery were mild and self-limited, and no late radiation toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION: CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery is a safe and effective modality in the treatment of patients with spinal tumors. CyberKnife offers durable pain relief and maintenance of quality of life with a very favorable side effect profile.",0
"In the past two decades, there has been a significant amount of research on children's relational aggression, which has been found to be associated with psychosocial problems. Longitudinal studies have examined changes in relational aggression during early adolescence in relation to individual characteristics; however, most studies compare individual differences between people with regard to rates of relational aggression. A shortcoming to the current literature is the lack of studies that use a multilevel approach to examine individual differences (between-person) as well as the extent to which individuals deviate from their own typical levels (within-person) over time. In this study, within- and between-person psychological and peer-related predictors of rates of relational aggression over time were examined. Participants included 1,655 students in 5th-8th grade (mean age: 13.01) from four public middle schools in the Midwest, which consisted 828 females and 827 males. In terms of race and ethnicity, 819 (49.5%) were African Americans, followed by 571 (34.5%) Whites, and 265 (16%) Others. Longitudinal data were collected over four waves across two years of middle school. The findings indicated that contrary to the hypothesis that relational aggression would increase over time, there was no significant growth across time. Age, gender, and race were not associated with relational aggression over time; however, consistent with the Social Cognitive Theory, changes in within-person impulsivity, anger, and peer delinquency were all positively related to increases in relational aggression. At the between-person level of analysis, depressive symptoms and peer delinquency were related to relational aggression. Findings suggest that school-based programs that address anger management, impulsivity, empathy, and victimization could help prevent relational aggression.",1
"Crick, Murray-Close, and Woods (2005) encouraged the study of relational aggression as a developmental precursor to borderline personality features in children and adolescents. A longitudinal study is needed to more fully explore this association, to contrast potential associations with physical aggression, and to assess generalizability across various cultural contexts. In addition, parenting is of particular interest in the prediction of aggression or borderline personality disorder. Early aggression and parenting experiences may differ in their long-term prediction of aggression or borderline features, which may have important implications for early intervention. The currrent study incorporated a longitudinal sample of preschool children (84 boys, 84 girls) living in intact, two-parent biological households in Voronezh, Russia. Teachers provided ratings of children's relational and physical aggression in preschool. Mothers and fathers also self-reported their engagement in authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and psychological controlling forms of parenting with their preschooler. A decade later, 70.8% of the original child participants consented to a follow-up study in which they completed self-reports of relational and physical aggression and borderline personality features. The multivariate results of this study showed that preschool relational aggression in girls predicted adolescent relational aggression. Preschool aversive parenting (i.e., authoritarian, permissive, and psychologically controlling forms) significantly predicted aggression and borderline features in adolescent females. For adolescent males, preschool authoritative parenting served as a protective factor against aggression and borderline features, whereas authoritarian parenting was a risk factor for later aggression.",1
"INTRODUCTION: Overweight and obesity are highly prevalent among Australian men. Professional sports settings can act as a powerful 'hook' to engage men in weight loss programmes; the Football Fans in Training programme delivered in professional UK soccer clubs was successful and cost-effective in helping men lose weight. The Australian Football League (AFL) is a potentially attractive setting to engage men in a weight loss programme. We aim to develop, pilot and evaluate the feasibility of a weight loss intervention for overweight/obese middle-aged men, delivered in AFL settings, to promote weight loss and healthier  lifestyles and determine its suitability for a future randomised control trial. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 120 overweight/obese male fans will complete baseline physical and psychological health measures and objective measures of physical activity (PA), weight, waist size and blood pressure prior to randomisation into  the intervention or waitlist comparison group. The intervention group will receive 12 weekly 90 min workshops incorporating PA, nutrition education, behaviour change techniques and principles of effective motivation. Four community coaches will be trained to deliver Aussie-FIT at two AFL clubs in Western Australia. Measurements will be repeated in both groups at 3 months (post-intervention) and 6 months (follow-up). Outcomes will include programme uptake, attendance, changes in lifestyle and weight variables to inform power calculations for a future definitive trial, fidelity of programme delivery, acceptability, satisfaction with the programme and perceptions of effectiveness.  We will also determine trial feasibility and potential to gather cost-effectiveness data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was granted by Curtin University's Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC2017-0458). Results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and reports. A multicomponent dissemination strategy will include targeted translation and stakeholder engagement events to establish strategies for sustainability and policy change.

"The present research measured social reinforcement in rats, using a social-release procedure in which lever presses permitted 10-s access to a familiar social partner. The work requirements for reinforcement increased systematically according to progressive-ratio (PR) schedules. Social and food reinforcement value were compared across blocks of sessions (Experiment 1) and concurrently within the same sessions (Experiment 2). To assess motivational effects, response and reinforcer rates for both reinforcer types were studied under food restriction, social restriction, and combined food and social restriction. Responding was maintained by both reinforcers, albeit at substantially higher levels for food than for social access. Responding for social access decreased to low levels under extinction conditions, demonstrating  functional control by the social-reinforcement contingency. Sensitivity to social restriction was seen in some conditions in Experiment 2, in which social reinforcers were earned earlier in the session (at lower food prices) under social restriction than under the other deprivation conditions. Altogether, results are consistent with a social reinforcement conceptualization, and demonstrate an important role for social contact in social release behavior. The  study demonstrates a promising set of methods for analyzing and quantifying social reinforcement.",0
"BACKGROUND: Complementary medicine has become popular throughout many Western countries and is widely used by women across all stages of their life cycle. Acupuncture is used by women during their pregnancy, and research suggests that acupuncture may be used as an adjunct to their existing conventional care. The aim of this paper was to summarize the evidence examining the effectiveness of acupuncture during pregnancy and birthing, and to discuss its role as an adjunct  treatment. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search using several electronic databases. We included all placebo-controlled randomized trials of parallel design, and systematic reviews that evaluated the role of acupuncture during pregnancy and birthing. A critical appraisal of clinical trials and systematic reviews was undertaken. RESULTS: The summarized findings indicated a small but growing body of acupuncture research, with some evidence suggesting a benefit from acupuncture to treat nausea in pregnancy. Findings from the review also highlighted promising evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture to manage back and pelvic pain, acupuncture-type interventions to induce change in breech presentation, and pain  relief in labor. The methodological quality of recent trials has improved, and the quality of systematic reviews was high. CONCLUSIONS: Interest is growing in the use of acupuncture to treat some complaints during pregnancy and childbirth, and evidence is beginning to consolidate that acupuncture may assist with the management of some complaints during pregnancy. However, definitive conclusions about its effectiveness cannot  be reached and further research is justified.",0
"Three chronic psychiatric patients in a halfway house were enrolled in a program  of regular supervised jogging. In comparison with three other chronic patients from the same setting who received the same amount of attention but no jogging, the jogging group showed significantly less posttest trait anxiety. No significant posttest differences in body image were found between groups. The role of multi-process relaxation is discussed.",0
"This study examined adolescent narcissism, temperament (frustration and affiliation), and social goals in association with peer-reported physical and relational aggression (N = 384; 12-14 years). Narcissism was positively associated with dominance goals and negatively with closeness goals for peer interaction. Moreover, narcissism was positively associated with physical aggression via dominance goals for boys, and with relational aggression via dominance goals for both genders. Temperamental frustration and affiliation were both positively associated with relational aggression, but also interacted in their associations with this variable; affiliation was positively associated with relational aggression only at high levels of frustration. Supporting and extending existing research, the present findings suggest that adolescent personality and social goals are meaningfully associated with physical and relational aggression in the peer context.",1
"The purpose of the research was to evaluate the effect of feedback-assisted voluntary control to lower heart rate (HR), following a non-somatic mediated task designed to induce cardiovascular activation. Twenty-seven male subjects participated in this study and were randomly divided into three groups. All subjects were submitted to an arousing mental arithmetic task for a 1 min period, followed either by a feedback-assisted HR lowering task (FG), by an unassisted HR lowering task (ICG), or by a relaxation period (RCG). During this period (2 min duration), ICG and RCG subjects were required, as a help for HR deceleration or relaxation, to track visually a sweeping line similar in form to the continuous analogue feedback of the FG subjects. This sequence, interspaced by a 1 min rest  period, was repeated 10 times. Results showed that the mental arithmetic task was effective in producing consistent and repetitive HR acceleration. All three groups showed significative HR lowering during the following voluntary HR control or relaxation period. However, there was no difference in the speed or depth of HR lowering. It appeared that continuous-analogue feedback was not more effective than instructions to relax to assist HR return to lower levels.",0
"When studying adolescent development, it is important to consider two key areas that are salient for teens, which are self-concept and peer relations. A secondary analysis of the National Institute of Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development was conducted to examine the prospective bidirectional associations between self-concept and peer relations. To date, how social development broadly and peer relations in particular (e.g., relational aggression and victimization) affect self-concept domains is not fully understood. Using a large sample (N = 1063; 532 girls; M = 11.14 years; SD = .59) with multiple informants, the present study examined whether fifth grade relational aggression and sixth grade relational victimization was associated with adolescent self-concept in three key domains (i.e., academic, sports, physical appearance). A significant direct effect emerged, such that relational aggression in middle childhood was associated with decreases in academic self-concept and increases in sports self-concept in adolescence. Analyses also revealed that having higher levels of domain specific self-concept led to decreases in relational aggression across the transition to adolescence. The findings highlight the importance of examining bidirectional prospective associations between relational aggression, relational victimization, and domain specific self-concept. Implications for future research and clinical intervention are discussed.",1
"Adolescent peer aggression is a well-established correlate of romantic relational aggression; however, the mechanisms underlying this association are unclear. Heavy episodic drinking (or ""binge"" alcohol use) was examined as both a prior and concurrent mediator of this link in a sample of 282 12-18 year old interviewed four times over 6 years. Path analyses indicated that early peer relational and physical aggression each uniquely predicted later romantic relational aggression. Concurrent heavy episodic drinking fully mediated this effect for peer physical aggression only. These findings highlight two important mechanisms by which peer aggression may increase the risk of later romantic relational aggression: a direct pathway from peer relational aggression to romantic relational aggression and an indirect pathway through peer physical aggression and concurrent heavy episodic drinking. Prevention programs targeting romantic relational aggression in adolescence and young adulthood may benefit from interventions that target multiple domains of risky behavior, including the heavy concurrent use of alcohol.

"OBJECTIVE: Research among adults suggests that materialism and life satisfaction  negatively influence each other, causing a downward spiral. So far, cross-sectional research among children has indicated that materialistic children are less happy, but causality remains uncertain. This study adds to the literature by investigating the longitudinal relation between materialism and life satisfaction. We also investigated whether their relation depended on children's level of exposure to advertising. METHODS: A sample of 466 children (aged 8-11; 55% girls) participated in a 2-wave online survey with a 1-year interval. We asked children questions about material  possessions, life satisfaction, and advertising. We used structural equation modeling to study the relationship between these variables. RESULTS: For the children in our sample, no effect of materialism on life satisfaction was observed. However, life satisfaction did have a negative effect  on materialism. Exposure to advertising facilitated this effect: We only found an effect of life satisfaction on materialism for children who were frequently exposed to advertising. CONCLUSIONS: Among 8- to 11-year-old children, life satisfaction leads to decreased materialism and not the other way around. However, this effect only holds for children who are frequently exposed to television advertising. It is plausible that the material values portrayed in advertising teach children that material possessions are a way to cope with decreased life satisfaction. It is important to reduce this effect, because findings among adults suggest that materialistic children may become less happy later in life. Various intervention  strategies are discussed.",0
"According to the Appraisal-Tendency Framework (Han, Lerner, & Keltner, 2007), certainty-associated emotions increase risk taking compared with uncertainty-associated emotions. To date, this general effect has only been shown in static judgement and decision-making paradigms; therefore, the present study tested the effect of certainty on risk taking in a sequential decision-making task. We hypothesised that the effect would be reversed due to the kind of processing involved, as certainty is considered to encourage heuristic processing that takes into account the emotional cues arising from previous decisions, whereas uncertainty leads to more systematic processing. One hundred and one female participants were induced to feel one of three emotions (film clips) before performing a decision-making task involving risk (Game of Dice Task; Brand et al., 2005). As expected, the angry and happy participants (certainty-associated emotions) were more likely than the fearful participants (uncertainty-associated emotion) to make safe decisions (vs. risky decisions).",0
"Emotions are at the core of human cognition and behavior. Traditionally, emotions have been classified dichotomously as being either positive or negative. However, recent behavioral research (An et al., 2017) suggests that emotions contain both  positivity and negativity. The current work investigated neural correlates of experiencing positive and negative emotions in response to happy and sad photos.  Functional MRI revealed the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex showed stronger activation when experiencing positivity compared to negativity of sadness, but not happiness, whereas the bilateral cerebellum showed greater response to positivity than negativity regardless of emotion. Results suggest that there are similarities and differences in the neural activation of positivity and negativity of happiness and sadness, consistent with previous findings (An et al., 2017). Emotion from both the neural and psychological perspectives were investigated. Further implications are discussed.",0
"Cross-sectional and longitudinal research has shown that race-related stress is associated with increased depressive symptoms among racial/ethnic minorities. Rumination has long been considered a maladaptive self-regulatory response to race-related stress, and growing evidence suggests that it may be an important link in the relation between race-related stress and depression. More adaptive forms of self-regulation, such as active coping, may counteract the negative impact of rumination. We examined the influence of rumination on the relation between race-related stress and depressive symptoms in a sample (N = 69) of young adult (mean age = 20 ± 1.5 years) African American women. We also considered the  possible moderating effects of John Henryism, a form of persistent and determined goal striving, and vagally mediated heart rate variability, a purported biomarker of coping. Anticipatory race-related stress was indirectly associated with depressive symptoms through rumination: estimate = 0.07, 95% confidence interval  [0.01, 0.16]. Both John Henryism and vagally mediated heart rate variability moderated the relationship between race-related stress and rumination; however, only John Henryism reliably influenced the indirect association between race-related stress and depression through rumination. We discuss these findings  in the context of growing research examining the interplay between cultural and biological factors in the risk for poorer mental health.",0
"OBJECTIVE:: Worldwide, little information is available about the extent to which  children with mental disorders in the general population receive treatment from health professionals that meets minimal clinical practice guidelines. This study  identifies the percentage of 6-17 year olds with mental disorders in the 2013-2014 Australian national survey of mental health who had sufficient contact  with health professionals during the 18 months after the survey to have received  treatment meeting criteria for minimally adequate treatment (MAT). It also identifies factors associated with children having this level of contact with health professionals. METHOD:: Mental disorders were identified using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV completed by parents. Health professional attendances and psychotropic medications dispensed were identified from linked national Medicare  Benefits Schedule and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme records. RESULTS:: Only 11.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] [9.1, 14.8]) of children with  disorders ( n = 517) had sufficient contact to achieve study criteria for MAT. Furthermore, among children with mental disorders who had severe functional impairment and whose parents perceived that their child needed help ( n = 146), 20.2% (95% CI [14.3, 27.9]) had contact sufficient for MAT, 46.0% (95% CI [37.8,  54.4]) had contact that did not achieve MAT criteria and 33.8% (95% CI [26.1, 42.3]) had no contact with health professionals. In multivariable regression, children with moderate or severe functional impairment were more likely to have had sufficient contact to meet MAT criteria. CONCLUSION:: During the 18 months after being identified with a mental disorder,  only a small percentage of children have enough contact with health professionals to allow provision of MAT. This may be contributing to the unchanging high prevalence of childhood mental disorders.",0
"Relational aggression occurs in many different contexts, including in romantic relationships. The current study examined associations between two subtypes of relational aggression (love withdrawal and social sabotage) and marital quality over a 5-year time period. Participants consisted of 311 married couples who completed a number of questionnaires on relational aggression and relationship quality once a year over a 5-year period. Results revealed that relational aggression was highly stable over time and that women used more relational aggression than men. Men's use of social sabotage and love withdrawal were bidirectionally related to both partners' perceptions of poor marital quality over time. Conversely, only women's use of love withdrawal was related to her own perceptions of poor marital quality over time. Collectively, these results suggest that relational aggression by men may be less common, though particularly toxic in a marital relationship. Couples are encouraged to find healthier ways of coping with problems in relationships. (PsycINFO Database Record",1
"A three-wave longitudinal study among ethnically diverse preadolescents (N = 597 at Time 1, ages 9-11) was conducted to examine adaptive, maladaptive, mediational, and bidirectional processes of relational and physical aggression, victimization, and peer liking indexed by peer acceptance and friendships. A series of nested structural equation models tested the hypothesized links among these peer-domain factors. It was hypothesized that (1) relational aggression trails both adaptive and maladaptive processes, linking to more peer victimization and more peer liking, whereas physical aggression is maladaptive, resulting in more peer victimization and less peer liking; (2) physical and relational victimization is maladaptive, relating to more aggression and less peer liking; (3) peer liking may be the social context that promotes relational aggression (not physical aggression), whereas peer liking may protect against peer victimization, regardless of its type; and (4) peer liking mediates the link between forms of aggression and forms of peer victimization. Results showed that higher levels of peer liking predicted relative increases in relational aggression (not physical aggression), which in turn led to more peer liking. On the other hand, more peer liking was predictive of relative decreases in relational aggression and relational victimization in transition to the next grade (i.e., fifth grade). In addition, relational victimization predicted relative increases in relational aggression and relative decreases in peer liking. Similarly, physical aggression was consistently and concurrently associated more physical victimization and was marginally predictive of relative increases in physical victimization in transition to the next grade. More peer liking predicted relative decreases in physical victimization, which resulted in lower levels of peer liking. The directionality and magnitude of these paths did not differ between boys and girls.",1
"The etiology of digestive pathologies such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and cancer is not yet fully understood. In recent years, several studies have evidenced circadian variations in mechanisms involved in digestive health. In situations of disturbed circadian rhythms (chronodisruption) where the central clock and the peripheral clocks receive incoherent signals, the synchronicity is lost producing implications for health.  This lack of coordination could alter the tissue function and cause long term damage to the organs. Life habits such as sleep, physical exercise, social interaction, and feeding times are determinants for stability and integrity of circadian rhythms. In recent years, experimental and clinical studies have consistently evidenced that the alteration of circadian rhythms is associated with the development of digestive pathologies mainly linked to dismotility or changes in microbiota composition. Likewise, it seems reasonable to deep into the importance of chronodisruption as a factor that may participate in the development of pathologies such as IBS, IBD and digestive cancers. Moreover, life habits respecting circadian rhythms should be promoted for the prevention of these diseases. Further studies will allow us a better understanding of the mechanisms acting at molecular level, and the development of new therapeutic targets.",0
"Background: Anhedonia is a common symptom following exposure to traumatic stress  and a feature of the PTSD diagnosis. In depression research, anhedonia has been linked to deficits in reward functioning, reflected in behavioural and neural responses. Such deficits following exposure to trauma, however, are not well understood. Objective: The current study aims to estimate the associations between anhedonia, PTSD symptom-clusters and behavioural and electrophysiological responses to reward. Methods: Participants (N = 61) were recruited among Danish treatment-seeking veterans at the Department of Military Psychology in the Danish Defence. Before entering treatment, participants were screened with symptom measurement instruments and participated in a joint behavioural-electrophysiological experiment. The experimental paradigm consisted  of a signal-detection task aimed at assessing reward-driven learning. Simultaneous electrophysiological-recordings were analysed to evaluate neural responses upon receiving reward, as indicated by the Feedback-Related Negativity  (FRN) component. Result: Anhedonia as conceptualized in depression correlated with behavioural learning (r = -0.28, p = .032). Neither anhedonia nor behavioural learning correlated with FRN. However, the anhedonia symptom cluster  of PTSD did correlate with FRN (r = 0.29, p = .023). Extending upon this in an exploratory analysis, the specific PTSD-symptom emotional numbing was found to correlate moderately with FRN (r = 0.38, p = .003). Conclusion: The present data  suggest that anhedonia in trauma-exposed individuals is related to the anticipatory aspect of reward, whereas the neural consummatory reward response seems unlinked. Interestingly, emotional numbing in the same population is related to the consummatory phase of reward, correlating with the FRN response. This suggests that anhedonia and emotional numbing in response to trauma might pertain to different phases of reward processing.",0
"Mental contamination occurs when individuals experience feelings of internal dirtiness and distress in the absence of physical contact with a contaminant. Women who experience sexual trauma frequently report mental contamination. The self-regulatory executive function (S-REF) model proposes that metacognitive beliefs contribute to the appraisal and regulation of thinking, leading to expectations that metacognitive beliefs would predict greater mental contamination severity following an evoking source. Women who reported directly experiencing sexual trauma (N = 102) completed self-report measures of metacognitive beliefs and covariates during an online study session, and subsequently completed a task that evoked mental contamination during a follow-up in-person study session. Metacognitive beliefs surrounding the uncontrollability  and danger of thoughts, cognitive confidence, and the need to control thoughts positively correlated with mental contamination severity following the evoking source. Metacognitive beliefs surrounding the uncontrollability and danger of thoughts predicted greater mental contamination severity following the evoking source in multivariate analyses that statistically controlled for baseline mental contamination severity, trait anxiety, and overlap among the metacognitive beliefs. The present results provide preliminary support for the S-REF model as a potential framework for conceptualizing mental contamination.",0

"Objective: To explore the developmental characteristics of circadian rhythms in hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis during puberty. Methods: A total of 1 070 students from Grade 2-3 in 3 primary schools in Ma'anshan city, Anhui province, were selected for physical examination and circadian rhythm of HPA axis checked from 2015 to 2017. Saliva samples were collected at each of the following three time points: immediately upon wakening, 30 minutes after wakening and bedtime, with the index of circadian rhythm of HPA axis calculated, which including cortisol awake response (CAR), cortisol in puberty priming and diurnal cortisol slope (DCS). Testicular volume, palpation and visual inspection of breast development were used to assess the state of purbety development on boys and girls. Information on gender, date of birth, time to fall asleep, wake-up time and weekly physical activity were gathered through questionnaire survey. Non-parametric test was used to compare the differences of baseline, follow-up period and different adolescent developmental processes of each index on circadian rhythm of HPA axis. Results: During the period of follow-up program and comparing with the continuous undeveloped group, CAR and the changes of CAR showed significantly increase, both in the puberty priming group and continuous development group, with statistically significant differences (CAR: Z=8.551, 4.680, respectively; P<0.01; the changes of CAR: Z=4.079, 2.700, respectively, P<0.01). There were no significant differences noticed in CAR and the changes of CAR between puberty priming group or continuous development group. The area under the curve (AUC) of cortisol in puberty priming group was slightly higher than that in the persistent undeveloped group (Z=2.591, P=0.010). Both the changes of daily cortisol slope (DCS) in puberty priming group and continuing developed group decreased significantly, when comparing with those in continuous undeveloped group (Z=-2.450, Z=-2.151; all P<0.05). There was no significant difference noticed in the changes of cortisol in puberty priming and DCS between different puberty development stages (the changes of AUC: chi(2)=2.747, P=0.253; DCS: chi(2)=4.554, P=0.032). Conclusions: The indexes of circadian rhythm of HPA axis were associated with the development of puberty. Both the cortisol awakening response and the total amount of diurnal cortisol secretion showed an increase, along with the puberty development. The change of diurnal cortisol slope declined with the development of puberty.",1
"Aging leads to changes in circadian rhythms, including decreased amplitude or robustness, altered synchrony with the environment, and reduced coordination of rhythms within body. These circadian rhythm alterations are more pronounced in age-associated neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), in which they often precede the onset of other symptoms by many years. As well as their early onset, the findings that fragmentation of daily rest-activity rhythms in non-demented older subjects is associated earlier cognitive decline, increased risk of incident AD, and preclinical AD neuropathology, suggest that circadian rhythm disruption may contribute to the development and progression of the neuropathological changes occurring in AD. Conversely, other studies have implicated amyloid-beta, a prominent neurotoxin that accumulates in AD, in the impairment of circadian rhythms. Thus, circadian rhythm disruption and AD-associated neurodegeneration may interact to form a deleterious cycle. This article reviews the neural and molecular mechanisms underlying the age- and AD-related changes in circadian rhythms. It also explores therapeutic strategies proposed to ameliorate circadian rhythm deficits in elderly and demented individuals.",1
"INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular diseases are common co morbidities of schizophrenia  and constitute the main factors of high mortality in this pathology. Cardiovascular damages are favored by some risk factors, of which one of the most important is dyslipidemia. In this context, a study of lipid profile in schizophrenia is interesting.  The aims of this study were to compare the lipid profile of patients with schizophrenia to healthy controls and to investigate the associations between lipid parameters and demographics, clinical and treatment characteristics of the patients. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study between April 2013 and March 2014 on 78 patients with schizophrenia and 68 healthy subjects who benefited from the dosage of four serum lipid parameters: total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), High-density lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) and Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). For the socio-demographic and clinical assessments, we used  an information sheet and the following psychometric scales: PANSS (Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale), CGI (Clinical Global Impressions), GAF (Global Assessment Functionning) and the Calgary scale for depression. RESULTS: The comparative study showed that serum concentrations of TC and LDL-C were significantly higher for patients compared to healthy controls respectively  with (t=2,83 ; p=0,008) and             (t=9,35; p<0,001), the cholesterol ratio  (TC / HDL-C) was also significantly higher for patients           (t=2,23; p=0,033). The patients had significantly higher prevalence of hypercholesterolemia              (OR = 2.96) and low density hyperlipoproteinemia (OR = 18.79). The analytical study in the population of patients showed that the age ≥35 year-old, male gender and alcohol consumption were associated with disturbances in lipid parameters. Cannabis consumption was associated with significantly lower concentrations in TG. Concerning clinical features, paranoid schizophrenia was associated with less dyslipidemia unlike the depressive dimension assessed by the Calgary scale. There was a negative correlation between plasmatic TG concentrations and doses of antipsychotics. CONCLUSION: The vast majority of the literature confirms that patients with schizophrenia are at greater risk of dyslipidemia. This high risk appears to be more important with the consumption of alcohol and tobacco. It seems also that age and masculine gender are dyslipidemia risk factors for schizophrenic patients. The paranoid type of schizophrenia and positive symptoms seem to be associated with less dyslipidemia while depressive symptoms worsen lipid parameters. It then follows that, clinical and regular monitoring of lipid profile, lifestyle recommendations (smoking cessation, exercise and balanced diet) and appropriate therapeutic choices could help reduce morbidity and mortality among patients with schizophrenia. A special focus should be accorded to patients with high negative and depression symptoms.",0
"Adults are recommended to engage in 150 min of moderate (MPA) to vigorous (VPA) aerobic physical activity per week, with the public health message of obtaining 3000 steps in 30 min. There is a paucity of research on step rate thresholds that correspond to absolute MVPA (moderate = 3 METs, vigorous = 6 METs) with no research evaluating adult relative MVPA (moderate = 40% VO2max, vigorous = 60% VO2max). Anthropometric differences also influence intensity-related step rate thresholds. The purpose of this study was to identify step rates across a range of walking intensities so that mathematical models incorporating anthropometric factors could be used to identify individualized MVPA step rate thresholds. Forty-three adults (25♀; age = 39.4 ± 15.2 years) completed a staged treadmill walking protocol with pedometers and indirect calorimetry: six-minutes at 2.4, 3.2, 4.0, 5.6, 6.4, 7.2 km/h. Mathematical modelling revealed absolute and relative MPA step rate thresholds of ~100 steps/minute (spm) and ~125 spm, respectively. VPA corresponded to step rates of ~133 spm and ~139 spm for absolute and relative thresholds respectively. The current public message of 3000 steps in 30 min is valid for absolute MPA. However, VPA is achieved at higher thresholds than previously reported, more than 130 spm for healthy adults.",0
"The interaction between hormonal circadian rhythms and feeding behaviour is not well understood. This study aimed to deepen our understanding of mechanisms underlying circadian feeding behaviour in animals, using pigs, Sus scrofa, as a case study. Pigs show an alternans feeding pattern, that is, a small peak of feed intake at the beginning of the day and a larger peak at the end of the day. We simulated the feeding behaviour of pigs over a 24h period. The simulation model contained mechanisms that regulate feeding behaviour of animals, including: processing of feed in the gastrointestinal tract, fluctuation in energy balance, circadian rhythms of melatonin and cortisol and motivational decision-making. From the interactions between these various processes, feeding patterns (e.g. feed intake, meal frequency, feeding rate) emerge. These feeding patterns, as well as patterns for the underlying mechanisms (e.g. energy expenditure), fitted empirical data well, indicating that our model contains relevant mechanisms. The circadian rhythms of cortisol and melatonin explained the alternans pattern of feeding in pigs. Additionally, the timing and amplitude of cortisol peaks affected the diurnal and nocturnal peaks in feed intake. Furthermore, our results suggest that circadian rhythms of other hormones, such as leptin and ghrelin, are less important in circadian regulation of feeding behaviour than previously thought. These results are relevant to animal species with a metabolic and endocrine system similar to that of pigs, such as humans. Moreover, the modelling approach to understand feeding behaviour can be applied to other animal species.",1
"Circadian clocks are near universal among organisms and play a key role in coordinating physiological and metabolic functions to anticipate or coincide with predictable daily changes in the physical and social environment. However, whether circadian rhythms persist and are functionally important during hibernation in all mammals is currently unclear. We examined whether circadian rhythms of body temperature (T b) persist during multi-day, steady-state torpor and investigated the association between timing of animal emergence, exposure to light, and resumption of activity and T b rhythms in free-living and captive male arctic ground squirrels. High-resolution (0.02 degrees C) temperature loggers revealed that circadian rhythms of T b were not present during deep torpor in free-living arctic ground squirrels. Significant circadian rhythms of T b resumed, however, following the resumption of euthermia, but prior to emergence, though rhythms became much more robust coincident with aboveground emergence. Additionally, squirrels maintained in captivity under conditions of constant darkness spontaneously developed significant circadian rhythms of T b and activity soon after ending torpor. Exposing animals to a 5-s pulse of light within a week when they ended torpor increased the strength of rhythms. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that circadian clock function is inhibited during hibernation in arctic ground squirrels, and we postulate that exposure to external stimuli, such as light in free-living animals, and meals or acute disturbance for captive squirrels, may enhance T b rhythmicity by synchronizing loosely coupled circadian oscillators within the suprachiasmatic nucleus.",1
"Circadian rhythms are 24-h patterns regulating behavior, organs, and cells in living organisms. These rhythms align biological functions with regular and predictable environmental patterns to optimize function and health. Disruption of these rhythms can be detrimental resulting in metabolic syndrome, cancer, or cardiovascular disease, just to name a few. It is now becoming clear that the intestinal microbiome is also regulated by circadian rhythms via intrinsic circadian clocks as well as via the host organism. Microbiota rhythms are regulated by diet and time of feeding which can alter both microbial community structure and metabolic activity which can significantly impact host immune and metabolic function. In this review, we will cover how host circadian rhythms are generated and maintained, how host circadian rhythms can be disrupted, as well as the consequences of circadian rhythm disruption. We will further highlight the newly emerging literature indicating the importance of circadian rhythms of the intestinal microbiota.",1
"A final common pathway (FCP) for tinnitus has been hypothesized since 1989 for all clinical types of tinnitus, particularly subjective idiopathic tinnitus (SIT) of the severe disabling type. This was intended to explain the transformation-transition of the sensation of an aberrant auditory sensation-tinnitus (i.e., the sensory component)-to one of affect (i.e., the emotional-behavioral component) or, conversely, that an emotional-behavioral stimulus (affect) can result in the clinical manifestation of a sensation (a sensory stimulus). Understanding the pathophysiology of this transformation is fundamental for the diagnosis of tinnitus and the treatment of the patient, and it presents a dilemma to basic science, neuroscience, and clinical medicine. Clinically, tinnitus is not a unitary symptom; it constitutes many clinical types; can have its origin in the auditory or nonauditory systems and in the peripheral or central nervous system; and may be clinically manifest or subclinical. Accumulating evidence is presented to support the original hypothesis of an FCP. The resolution of this dilemma involves sensory processing  (i.e., the integration, identification, and understanding of the ongoing, underlying, simultaneous, multiple associated brain function processes not only from one sensory modality but from multiple sensory modalities accompanying and associated with an FCP). In the FCP, the predominant brain function process is that of the sensory-affect transformation of a sensation and its conscious awareness by the affected patient. The neuroanatomical substrates identified in 1989 in tinnitus patients (reported originally in 1991 and published in 1995) are presented as a common framework for the hypothesis of an FCP. They further the understanding of the clinical heterogeneity of the tinnitus symptom, clinically manifest as multiple brain functions associated with the clinical course of tinnitus patients, particularly those with SIT. The FCP provides a model for tinnitus theory, diagnosis, and treatment. The FCP is not a tinnitus theory. Specifically, it is a hypothesis that attempts to explain how an aberrant auditory sensory stimulus becomes transformed into one of affect and somatomotor  response. The neuroanatomical substrates of the FCP provide a basis for the identification of the involved neurocircuitries and neurochemistries. The physiology and biochemistry underlying the neuroanatomical substrates of the FCP  provide a basis for translation for tinnitus diagnosis and treatment. The neuroanatomical substrates of the FCP are presented as algorithms of (1) components of a sensation (i.e., sensory, affect, and psychomotor), a translation from basic sensory physiology for tinnitus; (2) clinically manifest biophysiological brain functions and underlying processes associated with the tinnitus; (3) a model for investigation of metabolic-electrophysiological correlates for tinnitus; (4) the basis for an integrated theory of tinnitus and brain function (i.e., tinnitus dyssynchrony-synchrony theory; (5) a model for the identification of underlying neurocircuitries and neurochemistries involved in brain for the sensory-affect transformation of an aberrant auditory stimulus (tinnitus); (6) a model for the selection-introduction of innovative therapies attempting tinnitus relief; and (7) its clinical translation for objective monitoring systems for the determination of the efficacy of modalities of therapy attempting tinnitus relief. The hypothesis of the FCP for tinnitus and the identified neuroanatomical substrates, when viewed in terms of the physiology of  sensory processing, is considered to be expanded and broader in its application for all sensations, normal or aberrant.",0
"BACKGROUND: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently issued final  rules for the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program (MDPP), offering an unprecedented opportunity to provide lifestyle intervention to Medicare beneficiaries with prediabetes via a pay-for-performance model. The MDPP is based on the widely disseminated, yearlong National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP), which has lesser but still beneficial risk-reduction outcomes among minority and  low-income participants. OBJECTIVES: We compare projected payments based on outcomes of a diverse sample of Medicare beneficiaries to service delivery costs, and explore resulting implications for MDPP access and sustainability. METHODS: We delivered NDPP in a safety-net health care system from 2013 to 2017 and conducted an analysis of service cost, beneficiary performance, and projected MDPP reimbursement. RESULTS: Among 1165 total participants, 213 (18.3%) were Medicare beneficiaries.  Participating beneficiaries were 40.6% Hispanic, 31.6% non-Hispanic black, and 26.9% non-Hispanic white and 69.5% low-income. Overall beneficiary performance would result in an average reimbursement of $138.52 (interquartile range=162.50). Program delivery costs were $800 per participant, leaving an average gap of $661  per beneficiary. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from delivering the NDPP to diverse and undeserved patients show a large gap between service costs and projected reimbursement. Although many MDPP suppliers are needed to reach all Medicare beneficiaries with prediabetes, insufficient reimbursement may be a deterrent. Health disparities may also widen  as suppliers serving diverse and low-income populations will likely receive especially low payments, threatening access. Higher payments are supported by strong return-on-investment findings and seem needed to reduce diabetes prevalence and related disparities.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Although patient-therapist collaboration (working alliance) has been studied extensively in Europe and America, it is unknown to what extent the importance of working alliance for psychotherapy outcome generalizes to lower- and middle-income countries. Additionally, there is a need for more studies on the alliance using methods that are robust to confounders of its effect on outcome. METHOD: In this study, 345 outpatients seeking care at the 2 public psychiatric hospitals in Nairobi, Kenya, filled out the Session Alliance Inventory (SAI) and  the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) during each session. The effect of alliance on next-session psychological distress was modeled using the random intercept cross-lagged panel model, which estimates a cross-lagged panel model on within- and between-subjects disaggregated data. RESULTS: Changes in the working alliance from session to session significantly predicted change in psychological distress by the next session, with an increase  of 1 point of the SAI in a given session resulting in a decrease of 1.27 points on the CORE-OM by the next session (SE = .60, 95% confidence interval [-2.44, -.10]). This finding represents a medium-sized standardized regression coefficient of between .16 and .21. Results were generally robust to sensitivity  tests for stationarity, missing data assumptions, and measurement error. CONCLUSION: Results affirm cross-cultural stability of the session-by-session reciprocal effects model of alliance and psychological distress-symptoms as seen  in a Kenyan psychiatric outpatient sample, using the latest developments in cross-lagged panel modeling. A limitation of the study is its naturalistic design and lack of control over several variables. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved).",0
"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is an optimal approach that brings together community stakeholders, researchers and practitioners in an effort to understand and address social issues and health disparities experienced by vulnerable populations. Latino immigrant families in the United States with youth and young families with disabilities have experienced a number of barriers in gaining positive health outcomes. These families face challenges in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, placing them at high risk for obesity, diabetes, and other chronic health conditions. The purpose of this study was to develop a healthy lifestyles intervention in collaboration with Latino immigrant families with youth and young adults with disabilities using a CBPR approach, and to examine the impact of the intervention from participants' perspectives. METHODS: Grounded in the principles of CBPR, we developed a partnership with community stakeholders to create a healthy lifestyles intervention aimed at meeting the needs of Latino families in the United States. During and following implementation of the intervention, we conducted focus groups with 12 intervention participants to examine the impact of the intervention. RESULTS: Participants identified the intervention program as meeting a need in the community and reported specific positive aspects related to health behaviors, social learning, inclusion, community participation, and peer advocacy. DISCUSSION: CBPR healthy lifestyle interventions are relevant to the needs of Latino immigrant families with youth and young adults with disabilities. Health professionals should involve community residents in the design of healthy lifestyles programming to ensure strategies for change are relevant and relatable.",0

"The Barcelona Brain Health Initiative (BBHI) is an ongoing prospective longitudinal study focused on identifying determinants of brain health. The main  objectives are: (i) to characterize lifestyle, cognitive, behavioral and environmental markers related to a given individual's cognitive and mental functions in middle to old age, (ii) to assess the biological determinants predictive of maintenance of brain health, and (iii) to evaluate the impact of a  controlled multi-dimensional lifestyle intervention on improving and maintaining  brain health. The BBHI cohort consists of >4500 healthy participants aged 40-65 years followed through online questionnaires (Phase I) assessing participants' self-perceived health and lifestyle factors in seven different domains: overall health, physical exercise, cognitive activity, sleep, nutrition, social interactions, and life purpose. In Phase II a sub-group of 1,000 individuals is undergoing detailed in-person evaluations repeated at two-yearly intervals. These evaluations will provide deep phenotyping of brain function, including medical, neurological and psychiatric examinations, assessment of physical fitness, neuropsychological assessments, structural and functional brain magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography and perturbation-based non-invasive brain stimulation evaluations of brain activity, as well as collection of biological samples. Finally, in Phase III a further sub-group of 500 participants will undergo a similar in-person assessment before and after a multi-dimensional  intervention to optimize lifestyle habits and evaluate its effects on cognitive and brain structure and function. The intervention group will receive remote supervision through an ICT-based solution, with the support of an expert in health and lifestyle coaching strategies aimed at promoting adherence. On the other hand, the control group will not have this coaching support, and will only  receive education and recommendations about healthy habits. Results of this three-part initiative shall critically contribute to a better understanding of the determinants to promote and maintain brain health over the lifespan.",0

"Background Offset analgesia is a disproportionate decrease of pain perception following a slight decrease of noxious thermal stimulus and attenuated in patients with neuropathic pain. We examined offset analgesia in patients with heterogeneous chronic pain disorders and used functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore modification of cerebral analgesic responses in comparison with healthy controls. Results We recruited seventeen patients with chronic pain  and seventeen age-, sex-matched healthy controls. We gave a noxious thermal stimulation paradigm including offset analgesia and control stimuli on the left volar forearm, while we obtained a real-time continuous pain rating and a whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging. Baseline, first plateau (5 s), increment (5 s), and second plateau (20 s) temperatures of offset analgesia stimulus were set at 32°C, 46°C, 47°C, and 46°C, respectively. Control stimulus included 30-s 46°C stimulus or only the first 10 s of offset analgesia stimulus.  We evaluated magnitude of offset analgesia, analyzed cerebral activation by thermal stimulation, and further compared offset analgesia-related activation between the groups. Magnitude of offset analgesia was larger in controls than in  patients (median: 28.9% (interquartile range: 11.0-56.0%) vs. 19.0% (4.2-48.7%),  p = 0.047). During the second plateau, controls showed a larger blood oxygenation level-dependent activation than patients at the putamen, anterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, nucleus accumbens, brainstem, and medial prefrontal cortex ( p < 0.05), which are known to mediate either of descending pain modulation or reward responses. Offset analgesia-related activity at the anterior cingulate cortex was negatively correlated with neuropathic component of pain in patients with chronic pain ( p = 0.004). Conclusions Attenuation of offset analgesia was associated with suppressed activation of the descending pain modulatory and reward systems in patients with chronic pain, at least in the studied cohort. The present findings might implicate both behavioral and cerebral plastic alterations contributing to chronification of pain.

"Circadian rhythms are daily rhythms that regulate many biological processes - from gene transcription to behavior - and a disruption of these rhythms can lead to a myriad of health risks. Circadian rhythms are entrained by light, and their 24-h oscillation is maintained by a core molecular feedback loop composed of canonical circadian (""clock"") genes and proteins. Different modulators help to maintain the proper rhythmicity of these genes and proteins, and one emerging modulator is dopamine. Dopamine has been shown to have circadian-like activities in the retina, olfactory bulb, striatum, midbrain, and hypothalamus, where it regulates, and is regulated by, clock genes in some of these areas. Thus, it is likely that dopamine is essential to mechanisms that maintain proper rhythmicity of these five brain areas. This review discusses studies that showcase different dopaminergic mechanisms that may be involved with the regulation of these brain areas' circadian rhythms. Mechanisms include how dopamine and dopamine receptor activity directly and indirectly influence clock genes and proteins, how dopamine's interactions with gap junctions influence daily neuronal excitability, and how dopamine's release and effects are gated by low- and high-pass filters. Because the dopamine neurons described in this review also release the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA which influences clock protein expression in the retina, we discuss articles that explore how GABA may contribute to the actions of dopamine neurons on circadian rhythms. Finally, to understand how the loss of function of dopamine neurons could influence circadian rhythms, we review studies linking the neurodegenerative disease Parkinson's Disease to disruptions of circadian rhythms in these five brain areas. The purpose of this review is to summarize growing evidence that dopamine is involved in regulating circadian rhythms, either directly or indirectly, in the brain areas discussed here. An appreciation of the growing evidence of dopamine's influence on circadian rhythms may lead to new treatments including pharmacological agents directed at alleviating the various symptoms of circadian rhythm disruption.",1
"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate sleep consolidation and circadian activity rhythms in infants and toddlers with Down syndrome (DS) under light and socially entrained conditions within a familiar setting. Given previous human and animal data suggesting intact circadian regulation of melatonin across the day and night, it was hypothesized that behavioral indices of circadian rhythmicity would likewise be intact in the sample with DS. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 66 infants and young children with DS, aged 5-67 months, and 43 typically developing age-matched controls. Sleep and measures of circadian robustness or timing were quantified using continuous in-home actigraphy recordings performed over seven days. Circadian robustness was quantified via time series analysis of rest-activity patterns. Phase markers of circadian timing were calculated alongside these values. Sleep efficiency was also estimated based on the actigraphy recordings. RESULTS: This study provided further evidence that general sleep quality is poor in infants and toddlers with DS, a population that has sleep apnea prevalence as high as 50% during the preschool years. Despite poor sleep quality, circadian rhythm and phase were preserved in children with DS and displayed similar developmental trajectories in cross-sectional comparisons with a typically developing (TD) cohort. In line with past work, lower sleep efficiency scores were quantified in the group with DS relative to TD children. Infants born with DS exhibited the worst sleep fragmentation; however, in both groups, sleep efficiency and consolidation increased across age. Three circadian phase markers showed that 35% of the recruitment sample with DS was phase-advanced to an earlier morning schedule, suggesting significant within-group variability in the timing of their daily activity rhythms. CONCLUSIONS: Circadian rhythms of wake and sleep are robust in children born with DS. The present results suggest that sleep fragmentation and any resultant cognitive deficits are likely not confounded by corresponding deficits in circadian rhythms.",1
"Patients with liver cirrhosis may present impaired sleep-wake and circadian rhythms, relative adrenal insufficiency and altered hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland (HPA) axis. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Circadian rhythms are modulated by corticosteroids which secretion is regulated by HPA axis. Hyperammonemia alters circadian rhythms of activity and corticosterone in rats. The aims were: (1) assessing whether corticosterone alterations are responsible for altered circadian rhythm in hyperammonemia: (2) to shed light on the mechanism by which corticosterone circadian rhythm is altered in hyperammonemia. The effects of daily corticosterone injection at ZT10 on circadian rhythms of activity, plasma corticosterone, adreno-corticotropic hormone (ACTH) and hypothalamic corticotropic releasing hormone (CRH) were assessed in control and hyperammonemic rats. ACTH-induced corticosterone release was analyzed in cultured adrenal cells. Corticosterone injection restores the corticosterone peak in hyperammonemic rats and their activity and circadian rhythm. Plasma ACTH and CRH in hypothalamus are increased in hyperammonemic rats. Corticosterone injection normalizes ACTH. Chronic hyperammonemia impairs adrenal function, reduces corticosterone content and ACTH-induced corticosterone release in adrenals, leading to reduced feedback modulation of HPA axis by corticosterone which contributes to impair circadian rhythms of activity. Impaired circadian rhythms and motor activity may be corrected in hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy by corticosterone treatment.",1
"The in utero environment is inherently rhythmic, with the fetus subjected to circadian changes in temperature, substrates, and various maternal hormones. Meanwhile, the fetus is developing an endogenous circadian timing system, preparing for life in an external environment where light, food availability, and other environmental factors change predictably and repeatedly every 24 h. In humans, there are many situations that can disrupt circadian rhythms, including shift work, international travel, insomnias, and circadian rhythm disorders (e.g., advanced/delayed sleep phase disorder), with a growing consensus that this chronodisruption can have deleterious consequences for an individual's health and well-being. However, the impact of chronodisruption during pregnancy on the health of both the mother and fetus is not well understood. In this review, we outline circadian timing system ontogeny in mammals and examine emerging research from animal models demonstrating long-term negative implications for progeny health following maternal chronodisruption during pregnancy.",1
"In naturalistic multi-cue and multi-step learning tasks, where outcomes of behavior are delayed in time, discovering which choices are responsible for rewards can present a challenge, known as the credit assignment problem. In this  review, I summarize recent work that highlighted a critical role for the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in assigning credit where it is due in tasks where only a few of the multitude of cues or choices are relevant to the final outcome of behavior. Collectively, these investigations have provided compelling support for specialized roles of the orbitofrontal (OFC), anterior cingulate (ACC), and dorsolateral prefrontal (dlPFC) cortices in contingent learning. However, recent  work has similarly revealed shared contributions and emphasized rich and heterogeneous response properties of neurons in these brain regions. Such functional overlap is not surprising given the complexity of reciprocal projections spanning the PFC. In the concluding section, I overview the evidence  suggesting that the OFC, ACC and dlPFC communicate extensively, sharing the information about presented options, executed decisions and received rewards, which enables them to assign credit for outcomes to choices on which they are contingent. This account suggests that lesion or inactivation/inhibition experiments targeting a localized PFC subregion will be insufficient to gain a fine-grained understanding of credit assignment during learning and instead poses refined questions for future research, shifting the focus from focal manipulations to experimental techniques targeting cortico-cortical projections.",0
"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is frequently followed by a variety of physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms, which affect the patient's daily life, their social relations, and their work/educational status. In addition to function measures, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has received increasing attention as an important outcome after TBI, as it may guide rehabilitation and evaluate treatment success. Here, we report on psychometric properties of a Spanish translation of the quality of life after brain injury (QoLIBRI) questionnaire, a disease-specific instrument to assess HRQoL in patients after TBI. Classical test theory, item response theory, and structural equation modeling were used to evaluate psychometric properties of the Spanish QoLIBRI translation in a convenience sample of N = 155 patients with TBI. A subset of n = 23 patients were tested twice with a test-retest interval of ≤2 weeks. Internal consistency and test-retest reliabilities were high (Cronbach's α: 0.78-0.96; ICCs: 0.81-0.96). Rasch analysis infit (range 0.52-1.20) and outfit indices (range 0.50-1.17) supported unidimensionality of subscales, whereas SEM analysis  tended to support a correlated six-factor model (CFI = .88, RMSEA = .068, 95% confidence interval [.061, .075]). Results show favorable psychometric properties of the Spanish translation of the QoLIBRI, comparable to the international version. It is, thus, a useful instrument for clinicians and researchers assessing the impact of TBI on quality of life, the outcomes of rehabilitation, and may be included in epidemiological surveys.",0
"PURPOSE: Despite extensive research, mechanisms regulating postnatal eye growth and those responsible for ametropias are poorly understood. With the marked recent increases in myopia prevalence, robust and biologically-based clinical therapies to normalize refractive development in childhood are needed. Here, we review classic and contemporary literature about how circadian biology might provide clues to develop a framework to improve the understanding of myopia etiology, and possibly lead to rational approaches to ameliorate refractive errors developing in children. RECENT FINDINGS: Increasing evidence implicates diurnal and circadian rhythms in eye growth and refractive error development. In both humans and animals, ocular length and other anatomical and physiological features of the eye undergo diurnal oscillations. Systemically, such rhythms are primarily generated by the 'master clock' in the surpachiasmatic nucleus, which receives input from the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) through the activation of the photopigment melanopsin. The retina also has an endogenous circadian clock. In laboratory animals developing experimental myopia, oscillations of ocular parameters are perturbed. Retinal signaling is now believed to influence refractive development; dopamine, an important neurotransmitter found in the retina, not only entrains intrinsic retinal rhythms to the light:dark cycle, but it also modulates refractive development. Circadian clocks comprise a transcription/translation feedback control mechanism utilizing so-called clock genes that have now been associated with experimental ametropias. Contemporary clinical research is also reviving ideas first proposed in the nineteenth century that light exposures might impact refraction in children. As a result, properties of ambient lighting are being investigated in refractive development. In other areas of medical science, circadian dysregulation is now thought to impact many non-ocular disorders, likely because the patterns of modern artificial lighting exert adverse physiological effects on circadian pacemakers. How, or if, such modern light exposures and circadian dysregulation contribute to refractive development is not known. SUMMARY: The premise of this review is that circadian biology could be a productive area worthy of increased investigation, which might lead to the improved understanding of refractive development and improved therapeutic interventions.",1
"The purpose of this pilot study was to gather information on the immediate and short-term effects of relaxation training according to Yoga In Daily Life(®) (YIDL) system on the psychological distress of breast cancer patients. 32 patients at the Institute for Oncology of Ljubljana were randomized to the experimental (N=16) and to the control group (N=16). Both groups received the same standard physiotherapy for 1 week, while the experimental group additionally received a group relaxation training sessions according to YIDL(®) system. At discharge the experimental group was issued with audiocassette recordings containing the similar instructions for relaxation training to be practiced individually at home (for further 3 weeks). An experimental repeated measures design was used to investigate the differences over 1 month period in stress levels, changes in mental health and psychological parameters. Measures were obtained at three time points during the study period: baseline, at 1 week, and at 4 weeks, by blinded investigators using standardized questionnaires General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12), Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL) psychological subscale, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Patients who received relaxation training reported feeling significantly less distressed during hospitalization and after discharge-period than did the controls that did not receive relaxation training. The results indicate that relaxation training according to Yoga in Daily Life(®) system could be useful clinical physiotherapy  intervention for breast cancer patients experiencing psychological distress. Although this kind of relaxation training can be applied to clinical oncology in  Slovenia, more studies need to be done.",0
"Dopamine has been associated with risky decision-making, as well as with pathological gambling, a behavioral addiction characterized by excessive risk-taking behavior. However, the specific mechanisms through which dopamine might act to foster risk-taking and pathological gambling remain elusive. Here we test the hypothesis that this might be achieved, in part, via modulation of subjective probability weighting during decision making. Human healthy controls (n = 21) and pathological gamblers (n = 16) played a decision-making task involving choices between sure monetary options and risky gambles both in the gain and loss domains. Each participant played the task twice, either under placebo or the dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist sulpiride, in a double-blind counterbalanced design. A prospect theory modelling approach was used to estimate subjective probability weighting and sensitivity to monetary outcomes. Consistent with prospect theory, we found that participants presented a distortion in the subjective weighting of probabilities, i.e., they overweighted low probabilities  and underweighted moderate to high probabilities, both in the gain and loss domains. Compared with placebo, sulpiride attenuated this distortion in the gain  domain. Across drugs, the groups did not differ in their probability weighting, although gamblers consistently underweighted losing probabilities in the placebo  condition. Overall, our results reveal that dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonism modulates the subjective weighting of probabilities in the gain domain, in the direction of more objective, economically rational decision making.",0
"Circadian rhythms are 24-h rhythms in physiology and behaviour generated by molecular clocks, which serve to coordinate internal time with the external world. The circadian system is a master regulator of nearly all physiology and its disruption has major consequences on health. Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption (SCRD) is a ubiquitous feature in today's 24/7 society, and studies on shift-workers have shown that SCRD can lead not only to cognitive impairment, but also metabolic syndrome and psychiatric illness including depression (1,2). Mouse models of clock mutants recapitulate these deficits, implicating mechanistic and causal links between SCRD and disease pathophysiology (3-5). Importantly, treating clock disruption reverses and attenuates these adverse health states in animal models (6,7), thus establishing the circadian system as a novel therapeutic target. Significantly, circadian and clock-controlled gene mutations have recently been identified by Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in the aetiology of sleep, mental health and metabolic disorders. This review will focus upon the genetics of circadian rhythms in sleep and health.",1
"UNLABELLED: Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by depression, mania, and circadian rhythm abnormalities. Lithium, a treatment for BD stabilizes mood and increases circadian rhythm amplitude. However, in fibroblasts grown from BD patients, lithium has weak effects on rhythm amplitude compared to healthy controls. To understand the mechanism by which lithium differentially affects rhythm amplitude in BD cells, we investigated the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and related signaling molecules linked to BD and circadian rhythms. In fibroblasts from BD patients, controls and mice, we assessed the contribution of the ERK pathway to lithium-induced circadian rhythm amplification. Protein analyses revealed low phospho-ERK1/2 (p-ERK) content in fibroblasts from BD patients vs. CONTROLS: Pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 by PD98059 attenuated the rhythm amplification effect of lithium, while inhibition of two related kinases, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and P38 did not. Knockdown of the transcription factors CREB and EGR-1, downstream effectors of ERK1/2, reduced baseline rhythm amplitude, but did not alter rhythm amplification by lithium. In contrast, ELK-1 knockdown amplified rhythms, an effect that was not increased further by the addition of lithium, suggesting this transcription factor may regulate the effect of lithium on amplitude. Augmentation of ERK1/2 signaling through DUSP6 knockdown sensitized NIH3T3 cells to rhythm amplification by lithium. In BD fibroblasts, DUSP6 knockdown reversed the BD rhythm phenotype, restoring the ability of lithium to increase amplitude in these cells. We conclude that the inability of lithium to regulate circadian rhythms in BD may reflect reduced ERK activity, and signaling through ELK-1.",1
"OBJECTIVES: Circadian rhythms are affected in many neurological disorders. Although sleep disturbances are known in epilepsy, data on circadian rhythm disturbances in epilepsy are sparse. Here, we examined diurnal and circadian rest-activity and sleep-wake patterns in Kcna1-null mice, which exhibit spontaneous recurrent seizures and are a model of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Furthermore, we sought to determine whether seizures or aberrant oscillation of core clock genes and a regulator, sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), is associated with disrupted rhythms. METHODS: We used passive infrared actigraphy to assess rest-activity patterns, electroencephalography for seizure and sleep analysis, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting to evaluate expression of clock genes and Sirt1 in Kcna1-null and wild-type mice. RESULTS: Epileptic Kcna1-null animals have disrupted diurnal and circadian rest-activity patterns, tending to exhibit prolonged circadian periods. Electroencephalographic analysis confirmed disturbances in sleep architecture, with more time spent awake and less asleep. Although all epileptic mice manifested disrupted diurnal and circadian rest-activity patterns, we found no correlation between actual seizure burden and degree of sleep disruption. However, we found attenuated oscillations of several clock genes (ie, Clock, Bmal1, Per1, and Per2) and diurnal Sirt1 mRNA in the anterior hypothalamus. SIGNIFICANCE: Attenuated oscillation of several core clock genes correlates with, and may underlie, aberrant diurnal and circadian rest-activity and sleep-wake patterns observed in Kcna1-null mice. This could contribute to late complications in epilepsy, such as sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Sirt1 may represent a useful therapeutic target for rescuing circadian clock gene rhythmicity and sleep patterns in epilepsy.",1
"BACKGROUND: The present systematic review was aimed at critically summarizing the evidence about interventions focused on circadian rhythms and mood symptoms in seasonal affective disorder (SAD). METHODS: A systematic search of the electronic databases PUBMED, PsycINFO and Web of Science was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Original papers reporting data about the effects of treatments on both mood and circadian rhythms disturbances in SAD patients were considered for inclusion. The quality of the evidence provided by the eligible studies was assessed using the Revised Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RoB 2.0) and the Cochrane Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions Tool (ROBINS-I). RESULTS: Forty papers were deemed eligible for the systematic review. The evidence of treatment outcomes referring to circadian disturbances was not robust. Despite this, bright light therapy (BLT) demonstrates to phase-advance delayed rhythms and to improve sleep-wake disorders. As for mood symptoms, both BLT and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) show evidence of efficacy. The possible connection between improvements of mood symptoms and changes in circadian outcomes seems controversial. LIMITATIONS: The included studies presented considerable methodological heterogeneity, small sample sizes and non-optimal sample selection. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of BLT in depressive symptoms and circadian disturbances of SAD was outlined by the present systematic review. The evidence about other biological and pharmacological treatments, although promising, should be replicated. A multifactorial etiopathogenesis could explain the heterogeneous clinical presentations of SAD and the complex link between mood and circadian symptoms.",1
"Patients with liver cirrhosis show disturbances in sleep and in its circadian rhythms which are an early sign of minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE). The mechanisms of these disturbances are poorly understood. Rats with porta-caval shunt (PCS), a model of MHE, show sleep disturbances reproducing those of cirrhotic patients. The aims of this work were to characterize the alterations in circadian rhythms in PCS rats and analyze the underlying mechanisms. To reach these aims, we analyzed in control and PCS rats: (a) daily rhythms of spontaneous and rewarding activity and of temperature, (b) timing of the onset of activity following turning-off the light, (c) synchronization to light after a phase advance and (d) the molecular mechanisms contributing to these alterations in circadian rhythms. PCS rats show altered circadian rhythms of spontaneous and rewarding activities (wheel running). PCS rats show more rest bouts during the active phase, more errors in the onset of motor activity and need less time to re-synchronize after a phase advance than control rats. Circadian rhythm of body temperature is also slightly altered in PCS rats. The internal period length (tau) of circadian rhythm of motor activity is longer in PCS rats. We analyzed some mechanisms by which hypothalamus modulate circadian rhythms. PCS rats show increased content of cGMP in hypothalamus while the activity of cGMP-dependent protein kinase was reduced by 41% compared to control rats. Altered cGMP-PKG pathway in hypothalamus would contribute to altered circadian rhythms and synchronization to light.",1
"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition in which individuals exhibit memory loss, dementia, and impaired metabolism. Nearly all previous single-treatment studies to treat AD have failed, likely because it is a complex disease with multiple underlying drivers contributing to risk, onset, and progression. Here, we explored the efficacy of a multi-therapy approach based on the disease risk factor status specific to individuals with AD diagnosis or concern. METHODS: Novel software from uMETHOD Health was designed to execute a precision-medicinebased approach to develop personalized treatment recommendations with the goal of slowing or reversing biologic drivers of AD. AD-associated inputs encompassed genomic data, bio-specimen measurements, imaging data (such as MRIs or PET scans), medical histories, medications, allergies, co-morbidities, relevant lifestyle factors, and results of neuropsychological testing. Algorithms were then employed to prioritize physiologic and lifestyle states with the highest probability of contributing to disease status, and these  priorities were incorporated into a personalized care plan, which was delivered to physicians and supported by health coaches to increase adherence. The sample included 40 subjects with Subjective Cognitive Decline patients (SCD), and Mild Cognitive Impairment Patients (MCI). RESULTS: Software analysis was completed for 40 individuals. They remained on their treatment plan for an average of 8.4 months, equal to 2.8 iterations of care plans. 80% of individuals overall showed improved memory function scores or  held steady, as measured by standardized cognitive evaluations. Cognitive assessments showed significant improvement in the SCD group (Composite P value .002, Executive P value .01), and the CNS-VS Executive domain showed significant  results in the combined group as well (P value .01). There was also biomarker improvement over time observed from the blood panels. 8 out of 12 selected biomarkers showed slight, though statistically non-significant, improvement overall for symptomatic individuals, and 6 out of 12 for the overall population.  Only one biomarker, homocysteine, showed significant improvement, though (P values .03, .04, .002). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of these individuals lead to several interesting observations together suggesting that AD risk factors comprise a network of interlocking feedback loops that may be modifiable. Our findings indicate previously unidentified connectivity between AD risk factors, suggesting that treatment regimens should be tailored to the individual and multi-modal to simultaneously return several risk factors to a normative state. If successfully  performed, the possibility to slow progression of AD and possibly reverse aspects of cognitive decline may become achievable.",0
"Endogenous circadian ( approximately 24 h) clocks regulate key physiological and cognitive processes via rhythmic expression of clock genes. The main circadian pacemaker is the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Mood disorders, including bipolar disorder (BD), are commonly associated with disturbed circadian rhythms. Dopamine (DA) contributes to mania in BD and has direct impact on clock gene expression. Therefore, we hypothesized that high levels of DA during episodes of mania contribute to disturbed circadian rhythms in BD. The mood stabilizer valproic acid (VPA) also affects circadian rhythms. Thus, we further hypothesized that VPA normalizes circadian disturbances caused by elevated levels of DA. To test these hypotheses, we examined locomotor rhythms and circadian gene cycling in mice with reduced expression of the dopamine transporter (DAT-KD mice), which results in elevated DA levels and mania-like behavior. We found that elevated DA signaling lengthened the circadian period of behavioral rhythms in DAT-KD mice and clock gene expression rhythms in SCN explants. In contrast, we found that VPA shortened circadian period of behavioral rhythms in DAT-KD mice and clock gene expression rhythms in SCN explants, hippocampal cell lines, and human fibroblasts from BD patients. Thus, DA and VPA have opposing effects on circadian period. To test whether the impact of VPA on circadian rhythms contributes to its behavioral effects, we fed VPA to DAT-deficient Drosophila with and without functioning circadian clocks. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that VPA had potent activity-suppressing effects in hyperactive DAT-deficient flies with intact circadian clocks. However, these effects were attenuated in DAT-deficient flies in which circadian clocks were disrupted, suggesting that VPA functions partly through the circadian clock to suppress activity. Here, we provide in vivo and in vitro evidence across species that elevated DA signaling lengthens the circadian period, an effect remediated by VPA treatment. Hence, VPA may exert beneficial effects on mood by normalizing lengthened circadian rhythm period in subjects with elevated DA resulting from reduced DAT.",1
"In the healthy state, both circadian rhythm and mood are stable against perturbations, yet they are capable of adjusting to altered internal cues or ongoing changes in external conditions. The dual demands of stability and flexibility are met by the collective properties of complex neural networks. Disruption of this balance underlies both circadian rhythm abnormality and mood disorders. However, we do not fully understand the network properties that govern the crosstalk between the circadian system and mood regulation. This puzzle reflects a challenge at the center of neurobiology, and its solution requires the successful integration of existing data across all levels of neural organization, from molecules, cells, circuits, network dynamics, to integrated mental function. This essay discusses several open questions confronting the cross-level synthesis, and proposes that circadian regulation, and its role in mood, stands as a uniquely tractable system to study the causal mechanisms of neural adaptation.

"The Pre-Traumatic Vaccination Intervention (PTV) has been developed in an attempt to help rescue personnel cope with anticipated and non-anticipated disasters, and to prevent trauma-related mental disorders during and after a traumatogenic exposure. Contrary to the generally accepted approach of treating trauma after it has occurred, the PTV has been designed to be administered prior to the potentially traumatic event. Based on empirical findings, the PTV training techniques were designed to prepare the participants for distressful situations.  Trainees were gradually exposed to increasingly severe sights using cognitive-behavioral techniques along with foreseen situations relating to their  profession. Various interventions were aimed at normalizing using personal resources and implementing relaxation techniques. The PTV was administrated as part of the Israeli Defense Forces rescue personnel's and military police training courses. The results of an uncontrolled, preliminary study suggest that  the intervention reduced the level of dissociation leading to more awareness to the traumatic event's details, less suffering, lower probability of making mistakes, and increased likelihood of returning to normal functioning. Lower dissociation may suggest a lower probability to be diagnosed with post-traumatic  stress disorder among rescue personnel.",0
"OBJECTIVES: The circadian rhythm of clinical symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been primarily attributed to circadian variations in humoral factors and hormones. In this study, we investigated circadian rhythms of cellular immunity in RA (CiRA study). METHODS: Peripheral blood of female postmenopausal patients with active RA (DAS 28 >/= 4.2) (n=5) and female postmenopausal non-RA controls (n=5) was collected every 2 hours for 24 hours and analysed by flow cytometry, cytokine multiplex suspension array and quantitative RT-PCR of clock gene expression in isolated CD14+ monocytes. Endogenous circadian rhythms of macrophages were investigated by BMAL1-luciferase bioluminescence. Significance of circadian rhythms was tested by Cosinor analysis. RESULTS: We found (i) circadian rhythms in the relative frequency of peripheral blood cell populations that were present in postmenopausal non-RA controls but absent in patients with active RA, (ii) circadian rhythms that were absent in non-RA controls but present in patients with RA and (iii) circadian rhythms that were present in both groups but with differences in peak phase or amplitude or amplitude/magnitude. The circadian rhythm in expression of the clock genes PER2 and PER3 in CD14+ monocytes was lost in patients with RA. The amplitude of BMAL1-luciferase bioluminescence tended to be lower in patients with RA than in non-RA controls. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that (i) in RA some immune cell populations lose their normal circadian rhythms whereas others establish new 'inflammatory' circadian rhythms and (ii) these findings provide a good basis for further identifying pathophysiological aspects of RA chronobiology with potential therapeutic implications.",1
"OBJECTIVES: To further validate the diagnostic utility of 18F-AV-133 vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with clinically uncertain parkinsonian syndromes (CUPS) by comparison to clinical diagnosis at 3 years follow-up. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In a previous study, we reported that 18F-AV-133 PET in community patients with CUPS changed diagnosis and management and increased diagnostic confidence. The current diagnosis of this cohort was obtained from the patient and treating specialist and compared with the diagnosis suggested 3 years earlier by the 18F-AV-133 PET. A second 18F-AV-133 PET was available in those with a discordant or inconclusive final diagnosis. STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was the proportion of patients who  had a follow-up clinical diagnosis, which was concordant with their initial 18F-AV-133 PET scan. Secondary end points were the proportion of patients who had the same diagnosis at follow-up as that reached after the initial scan and the stability of diagnostic changes made after the first scan. RESULTS: 81 of the 85 patients previously recruited to the CUPS study had follow-up of which 79 had a clinical diagnosis and 2 remained CUPS. The diagnosis was in agreement with the initial 18F-AV-133 PET scan result in 74 cases. Five patients had a discordant diagnosis; one patient with rubral tremor had a severely abnormal scan that had worsened when rescanned; four cases with normal initial and repeat scans had a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Two patients with suspected genetic disorders remained classified as CUPS and both had normal scans. In the 24 CUPS cohort patients where 18F-AV-133 PET initially changed diagnosis, this change was supported by follow-up diagnosis in all but the one rubral tremor case. CONCLUSION: 18F-AV-133 PET is a useful tool in improving diagnostic accuracy in CUPS providing results and diagnostic changes that remain robust after 3 years follow-up.",0
"The neurotransmitter acetylcholine has been implicated in reward learning and drug addiction. However, the roles of the various cholinergic receptor subtypes on different neuron populations remain elusive. Here we study the function of muscarinic M4 receptors (M4Rs) in dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) expressing neurons and cholinergic neurons (expressing choline acetyltransferase; ChAT), during various reward-enforced behaviors and in a ""waiting""-impulsivity test. We applied cell-type-specific gene deletions targeting M4Rs in D1RCre or ChATCre mice. Mice  lacking M4Rs in D1R-neurons displayed greater cocaine seeking and drug-primed reinstatement than their littermate controls in a Pavlovian conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. Furthermore, the M4R-D1RCre mice initiated significantly more premature responses (PRs) in the 5-choice-serial-reaction-time-task (5CSRTT) than their littermate controls, indicating impaired waiting impulse control. In contrast, mice lacking M4Rs in cholinergic neurons did not acquire cocaine Pavlovian conditioning. The M4R-ChATCre mice were also unable to learn positive reinforcement to either natural reward or cocaine in an operant runway paradigm. Immediate early gene (IEG) expression (cFos and FosB) induced by repeated cocaine injections was significantly increased in the forebrain of M4R-D1RCre mice, whereas it remained  normal in the M4R-ChATCre mice. Our study illustrates that muscarinic M4Rs on specific neural populations, either cholinergic or D1R-expressing, are pivotal for learning processes related to both natural reward and drugs of abuse, with opposing functionality. Furthermore, we found that neurons expressing both M4Rs and D1Rs are important for signaling impulse control.",0
"Relaxation programs are known for their versatility, cost-effectiveness, and ability to help people obtain skills to regulate their mental states and promote  and maintain health. Self-Active Relaxation Therapy (SART) is a body-oriented approach to psychological rehabilitation that grew out of the suite of movement tasks developed in the Japanese psychotherapy known as Dohsa-hou, or the body movement method. The program for SART is designed to stretch, twist, and release  areas of the upper, lower, and whole body through a set of movements which are guided by the practitioner and performed ""self-actively"" by the client to empower them to learn to recognize points of tension in the body and act on their own to  achieve a relaxed state. Numerous studies have showed that SART is associated with reduced negative mood states and enhanced body awareness. A short version of SART has been investigated as a psychological support salon activity for the elderly, mothers raising children, special needs students, and children adapting  to school. The full program has also been applied in clinical settings to address or supplement treatments for psychological and developmental conditions, and longitudinally employed in community contexts to assist residents facing long-term disaster recovery circumstances in Japan. This paper reviews the research and applications of SART as a bodymind approach by critically examining  evidence and research gaps for future studies, comparing it with techniques established in the literature, and positing a self-regulatory framework for SART  as a tool to become aware of bodily states, regulate mood, and manage stress through the deliberate practice of relaxation.",0
"Post-translational control is a crucial mechanism for circadian timekeeping. Evolutionarily conserved kinases and phosphatases have been implicated in circadian phosphorylation and the degradation of clock-relevant proteins, which sustain high-amplitude rhythms with 24-hr periodicity in animal behaviors and physiology. Here, we report a novel clock function of the heterodimeric Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and its regulator sarah (sra) in Drosophila Genomic deletion of the sra locus dampened circadian locomotor activity rhythms in free-running constant dark after entrainment in light-dark cycles. Poor rhythms in sra mutant behaviors were accompanied by lower expression of two oscillating clock proteins, PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM), at the post-transcriptional level. RNA interference-mediated sra depletion in circadian pacemaker neurons was sufficient to phenocopy loss-of-function mutation in sra On the other hand, a constitutively active form of the catalytic calcineurin subunit, Pp2B-14D(ACT), shortened circadian periodicity in locomotor behaviors and phase-advanced PER and TIM rhythms when overexpressed in clock neurons. Heterozygous sra deletion induced behavioral arrhythmicity in Pp2B-14D(ACT) flies, whereas sra overexpression rescued short periods in these animals. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin in either wild-type flies or clock-less S2 cells decreased the levels of PER and TIM, likely by facilitating their proteasomal degradation. Taken together, these data suggest that sra negatively regulates calcineurin by cell-autonomously titrating calcineurin-dependent stabilization of PER and TIM proteins, thereby sustaining high-amplitude behavioral rhythms in Drosophila.",1
"It has been well-established that a variety of mind-body (MB) techniques, including yoga, mental imagery, hypnosis, biofeedback, and meditation, are effective at addressing symptoms such as pain, anxiety, nausea, and insomnia, as  well as helping with a wide variety of medical, emotional, and behavioral issues  in pediatric populations. In addition, MB skills can also be health promoting in  the long-term, and with regular practice, could potentially contribute to longer  attention spans, social skills, emotional regulation, and enhanced immune system  functioning. Importantly, the benefits accrued from MB skills are largely dose dependent, meaning that individuals who practice with some consistency tend to benefit the most, both in the short- and long-term. However, clinical experience  suggests that for busy patients, the regular practice of MB skills can be challenging and treatment adherence commonly becomes an issue. This commentary reviews the concept of technology assisted relaxation as an engaging and effective option to enhance treatment adherence (i.e., daily practice) for pediatric patients, for whom MB skills have been recommended to address physical  and mental health challenges.",0
"With recent introduction of poker machines in Australia, there have been claims of increases in the number of women with gambling-related problems. Research in the United States indicates, however, that men have a higher incidence of pathological gambling. The aims of this study were to ascertain among game machine users in a major city in Australia whether (a) more women than men exhibited symptoms of pathological gambling, (b) women reported higher guilt associated with their gambling, and (c) gamblers' self-assessment on several mood states was predictive of pathological gambling. A modified version of the South Oaks Gambling Screen was administered to 104 users of game machines (44 men, 60 women) sampled from patrons at gaming venues in Melbourne, Australia. Data indicated no significant sex difference in the proportion of pathological gamblers or in gambling-related guilt. Self-assessment of Happiness, Propensity for Boredom, and Loneliness, significantly predicted scores on the South Oaks Gambling Screen, with Unhappiness a significant independent predictor of pathological gambling. This may suggest that gambling acts to fill a need in the  lives of unhappy people or that individuals who lack control over their gambling  report higher unhappiness. Further research is needed to discover this relationship.",0
"Healthy living (HL) behaviors and characteristics are central to both preventing  and treating a myriad of chronic diseases; a key HL characteristic is cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). Knowing an individual's CRF provides vital information when assessing health status and formulating a plan of care. Normative reference values as well as thresholds that denote varying degrees of health and future risk exist for measures of CRF. However, improving upon the precision of CRF reference standards according to key factors as well as precision in how CRF assessments can be used to assess health status and prognosis is needed. The current review will: 1) provide an overview of current approaches to CRF assessment and interpretations; 2) describe more recent efforts to improve upon the precision of CRF values; and 3) describe the Fitness Registry and the Importance of Exercise: A National Data Base (FRIEND) for the precision of CRF as a clinical measure.",0
"BACKGROUND: Evidence has shown that there are several physical and mental advantages of exercise during pregnancy. Despite this, the recommendations for exercise during pregnancy are poorly fulfilled. The aim of this study was to illuminate non-exercising pregnant women's views and experiences concerning exercise before and during pregnancy. METHOD: The study had a qualitative design with an inductive approach and was analysed by content analysis. A total of 16 individual and face-to-face interviews were conducted with healthy pregnant women, mainly in the third trimester and living in Sweden. The participating women had not been exercising 3 months before pregnancy or during pregnancy. RESULTS: The main category ""Insurmountable now, but possible in the future"" was based on the four categories: ""Lost and lack of routines"", ""Feelings of inadequacy"", ""Having a different focus"" and ""Need for support"". The women experienced that their lack of routines was a major barrier that prevented them from exercising. Other factors that contributed were, for example, pregnancy-related problems, long working days and prioritizing family life. The women described it as difficult to combine exercise with their focus on the pregnancy and they missed continuous support from the antenatal care provider. The women expressed a need for suggestions concerning exercise during pregnancy and follow-up on previous counselling, especially when pregnancy-related issues arose. Information about easily accessible alternatives or simple home exercises  was requested. They felt immobile and were not satisfied with their inactivity and tried to partly compensate with everyday activities. The women identified the postpartum period as an important possibility for becoming more active, for their own sake, but also because they wanted to become role models for their children. CONCLUSION: Continuous support during pregnancy is needed concerning exercise. Pregnancy is mostly a barrier that prevents exercise for this group of women but, at the same time, may be a motivator and a possibility for better health. As the  result showed that these women were highly motivated to a life-style change post-pregnancy, it may be crucial to support previously non-exercising women postpartum.",0
"The article presents the results of medical sociological study carried out with the purpose of analyzing concepts and motivation attitudes of students of medical universities concerning healthy life-style and its components. The results of study demonstrate that students admitting importance of preservation of one's own health, are committed to unhealthy life-style and more often renounce sport involvement and are inactive in the area of diseases prevention and health promotion. It is emphasized that healthy life-style of students of medical universities is rather exception than prevalent practice.",0
"Behavioral circadian rhythms are controlled by multioscillator networks comprising functionally different subgroups of clock neurons. Studies have demonstrated that molecular clocks in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster are regulated differently in clock neuron subclasses to support their specific functions (Lee et al., 2016; Top et al., 2016). The nuclear receptor unfulfilled (unf) represents a regulatory node that provides the small ventral lateral neurons (s-LNvs) unique characteristics as the master pacemaker (Beuchle et al., 2012). We previously showed that UNF interacts with the s-LNv molecular clocks by regulating transcription of the core clock gene period (per) (Jaumouille et al., 2015). To gain more insight into the mechanisms by which UNF contributes to the functioning of the circadian master pacemaker, we identified UNF target genes using chromatin immunoprecipitation. Our data demonstrate that a previously uncharacterized gene CG7837, which we termed R and B (Rnb), acts downstream of UNF to regulate the function of the s-LNvs as the master circadian pacemaker. Mutations and LNv-targeted adult-restricted knockdown of Rnb impair locomotor rhythms. RNB localizes to the nucleus, and its loss-of-function blunts the molecular rhythms and output rhythms of the s-LNvs, particularly the circadian rhythms in PDF accumulation and axonal arbor remodeling. These results establish a second pathway by which UNF interacts with the molecular clocks in the s-LNvs and highlight the mechanistic differences in the molecular clockwork within the pacemaker circuit.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Circadian behavior is generated by a pacemaker circuit comprising diverse classes of pacemaker neurons, each of which contains a molecular clock. In addition to the anatomical and functional diversity, recent studies have shown the mechanistic differences in the molecular clockwork among the pacemaker neurons in Drosophila Here, we identified the molecular characteristics distinguishing the s-LNvs, the master pacemaker of the locomotor rhythms, from other clock neuron subtypes. We demonstrated that a newly identified gene Rnb is an s-LNv-specific regulator of the molecular clock and essential for the generation of circadian locomotor behavior. Our results provide additional evidence to the emerging view that the differential regulation of the molecular clocks underlies the functional differences among the pacemaker neuron subgroups.",1
"Caffeinated sugar-sweetened ""energy"" drinks are a subset of soft drinks that are  popular among young people worldwide. High sucrose diets impair cognition and alter aspects of emotional behaviour in rats, however, little is known about sucrose combined with caffeine. Rats were allocated to 2 h/day 10% sucrose (Suc), 10% sucrose plus 0.04% caffeine (CafSuc) or control (water) conditions. The addition of caffeine to sucrose appeared to increase the rewarding aspect of sucrose, as the CafSuc group consumed more solution than the Suc group. After 14  days of intermittent Suc or CafSuc access, anxiety was assessed in the elevated plus maze (EPM) prior to their daily solution access, whereby CafSuc and Suc rats spent more time in the closed arms, indicative of increased anxiety. Following daily solution access, CafSuc, but not Suc, rats showed reduced anxiety-like behaviour in the open-field. Control and CafSuc rats displayed intact place and long-term object memory, while Suc showed impaired memory performance. Sucrose reduced parvalbumin immunoreactivity in the hippocampus, but no differences were  observed between Control and CafSuc conditions. Parvalbumin reactivity in the basolateral amygdala did not differ between conditions. Reduced doublecortin immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus relative to controls was seen in the CafSuc, but not Suc, treatment conditions. These findings indicate that the addition of caffeine to sucrose attenuated cognitive deficits. However, the addition of caffeine to sucrose evoked anxiety-like responses under certain testing conditions, suggesting that frequent consumption of caffeinated energy drinks may promote emotional alterations and brain changes compared to standard soft drinks.",0
"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a serious mood disorder associated with circadian rhythm abnormalities. Risk for BD is genetically encoded and overlaps with systems that maintain circadian rhythms. Lithium is an effective mood stabilizer treatment for BD, but only a minority of patients fully respond to monotherapy. Presently, we hypothesized that lithium-responsive BD patients (Li-R) would show characteristic differences in chronotype and cellular circadian rhythms compared to lithium non-responders (Li-NR). Selecting patients from a prospective, multi-center, clinical trial of lithium monotherapy, we examined morning vs. evening preference (chronotype) as a dimension of circadian rhythm function in 193 Li-R and Li-NR BD patients. From a subset of 59 patient donors, we measured circadian rhythms in skin fibroblasts longitudinally over 5 days using a bioluminescent reporter (Per2-luc). We then estimated circadian rhythm parameters (amplitude, period, phase) and the pharmacological effects of lithium on rhythms in cells from Li-R and Li-NR donors. Compared to Li-NRs, Li-Rs showed a difference in chronotype, with higher levels of morningness. Evening chronotype was associated with increased mood symptoms at baseline, including depression, mania, and insomnia. Cells from Li-Rs were more likely to exhibit a short circadian period, a linear relationship between period and phase, and period shortening effects of lithium. Common genetic variation in the IP3 signaling pathway may account for some of the individual differences in the effects of lithium on cellular rhythms. We conclude that circadian rhythms may influence response to lithium in maintenance treatment of BD.",1
"Heme plays a role in the regulation of the expression of genes related to circadian rhythms and heme metabolism. In order to identify new heme-regulated proteins, an RNA sequence analysis using mouse NIH3T3 cells treated without or with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) was performed. Among the changes observed in the levels of various mRNAs including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and ALA synthase-1 (ALAS1), a mouse homologue of the plant circadian-regulating protein SRR1, SRR1 domain containing (SRRD) was induced by the ALA treatment. The expression of SRRD was dependent on heme biosynthesis, and increased the production of heme. SRRD was expressed under circadian rhythms, and influenced the expression of clock genes including PER2, BMAL1, and CLOCK. The knockout of SRRD arrested the growth of cells, indicating that SRRD plays roles in heme-regulated circadian rhythms and cell proliferation.",1
"BACKGROUND: Research on the effect of age on affective reactivity continues to provide inconsistent findings. The present study addresses two potential explanations that may account for these inconsistencies. First, gender may moderate age differences in affective reactivity and second, age differences in affective reactivity may vary according to emotion category. The aim of the present study was therefore to examine age differences in reactions to emotion-inducing images when singling out the effect of gender and emotion category. METHODS: A sample of 396 young (mean age = 23.31, SD = 3.70; 66% female) and old  (mean age = 66.09, SD = 4.31; 37.5% female) Danish adults rated 105 images from the Nencki Affective Picture System (NAPS) database according to valence and arousal. Images were divided into the three emotion categories of disgust, sadness, and happiness. RESULTS: The findings indicate that age-group influenced affective reactivity, but there was no indication of an an interaction between age-group and gender. Going beyond previous studies, the findings demonstrate that the effect of age-group on affective reactivity varies according to emotion category. CONCLUSION: The results highlight the importance of considering emotion category  in studies of age differences in affective reactivity.",0
"UNLABELLED: Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with mood episodes and low amplitude circadian rhythms. Previously, we demonstrated that fibroblasts grown from BD patients show weaker amplification of circadian rhythms by lithium compared to control cells. Since calcium signals impact upon the circadian clock, and L-type calcium channels (LTCC) have emerged as genetic risk factors for BD, we examined whether loss of function in LTCCs accounts for the attenuated response to lithium in BD cells. We used fluorescent dyes to measure Ca(2+) changes in BD and control fibroblasts after lithium treatment, and bioluminescent reporters to measure Per2::luc rhythms in fibroblasts from BD patients, human controls, and mice while pharmacologically or genetically manipulating calcium channels. Longitudinal expression of LTCC genes (CACNA1C, CACNA1D and CACNB3) was then measured over 12-24 h in BD and control cells. Our results indicate that independently of LTCCs, lithium stimulated intracellular Ca(2+) less effectively in BD vs. control fibroblasts. In longitudinal studies, pharmacological inhibition of LTCCs or knockdown of CACNA1A, CACNA1C, CACNA1D and CACNB3 altered circadian rhythm amplitude. Diltiazem and knockdown of CACNA1C or CACNA1D eliminated lithium's ability to amplify rhythms. Knockdown of CACNA1A or CACNB3 altered baseline rhythms, but did not affect rhythm amplification by lithium. In human fibroblasts, CACNA1C genotype predicted the amplitude response to lithium, and the expression profiles of CACNA1C, CACNA1D and CACNB3 were altered in BD vs. CONTROLS: We conclude that in cells from BD patients, calcium signaling is abnormal, and that LTCCs underlie the failure of lithium to amplify circadian rhythms.",1
"High rates of childhood obesity require integral treatment with lifestyle modifications that achieve weight loss. We evaluated a lifestyle intervention on  nutrient adequacy and diet quality in children and adolescents with abdominal obesity. A randomized controlled trial was performed on 107 participants, assigned either to a usual care group or to an intensive care group that followed a moderate hypocaloric Mediterranean diet and received nutritional education. Intake adequacy was evaluated using Dietary Reference Intakes and diet quality through the Diet Quality Index for Adolescents (DQI-A), the Healthy Lifestyle Diet-Index (HLD-I) and the Mediterranean Diet Quality Index (KIDMED). Both groups achieved a significant reduction in BMI standard deviation score (BMI-SDS), glucose and total cholesterol levels. Intake of Calcium, Iodine and vitamin D were higher in the intensive care group, with enhanced compliance with recommendations. Higher dietary scores were associated with lower micronutrient inadequacy. DQI-A and HLD-I were significantly higher in the intensive care group vs. usual care group after the treatment. In conclusion, we observed that an intensive lifestyle intervention was able to reduce BMI-SDS in children with abdominal obesity. Furthermore, participants significantly improved dietary indices getting closer to the nutritional recommendations. Therefore, these diet  quality indices could be a valid indicator to evaluate micronutrient adequacy.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Conceptual understandings of meaning-making suggest that it may have protective value in regard to alcohol misuse and suicidal behavior. Accordingly,  the aim of this study was to examine whether meaning-making attenuated the relationship between alcohol misuse and suicide risk severity in a population of  active-duty service members. METHODS: The sample (N = 97) was recruited while presenting for emergency behavioral health services in circumstances indicative of high-risk suicidality:  endorsing current suicidal ideation with intent to die. Those who reported ideation with a lifetime history of a past suicide attempt were conceptualized as being in a more severe category of suicide risk than ideation without a lifetime  history of a past suicide attempt. Participants completed the Suicidal Behaviors  Questionnaire-Revised, Meaning in Life Questionnaire, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test consumption questions, and items that assessed demographic variables. Data were analyzed using chi-squared test of independence, Fisher's exact test, Kendall rank correlation coefficient, and logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: Regression analysis identified a statistically significant association between number of drinks consumed daily and reporting a lifetime history of a past suicide attempt, odds ratio (OR) = 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.11, 2.32], p = .01. Number of drinks consumed remained significant even after adjusting for both the search for and presence of meaning, OR = 1.70, 95% CI [1.16, 2.51], p = .01. These results remained unchanged even when adjusting for gender, race, ethnicity, and relationship status. No statistically significant interaction effects were noted between meaning-making and alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Meaning-making did not appear to attenuate the effect of alcohol misuse on suicide risk severity in a sample of service members at high-risk of suicidality. Additional research is needed to better understand the relationship  among meaning-making, alcohol misuse, and suicidal behavior.",0
"Most living organisms maintain cell autonomous circadian clocks that synchronize critical biological functions with daily environmental cycles. In mammals, the circadian clock is regulated by inputs from signaling pathways including glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). The drug lithium has actions on GSK3, and also on inositol metabolism. While it is suspected that lithium's inhibition of GSK3 causes rhythm changes, it is not known if inositol polyphosphates can also affect the circadian clock. We examined whether the signaling molecule inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) has effects on circadian rhythms. Using a bioluminescent reporter (Per2::luc) to measure circadian rhythms, we determined that IP6 increased rhythm amplitude and shortened period in NIH3T3 cells. The IP6 effect on amplitude was attenuated by selective siRNA knockdown of GSK3B and pharmacological blockade of AKT kinase. However, unlike lithium, IP6 did not induce serine-9 phosphorylation of GSK3B. The synthesis of IP6 involves the enzymes inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) and inositol pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (IPPK). Knockdown of Ippk had effects opposite to those of IP6, decreasing rhythm amplitude and lengthening period. Ipmk knockdown had few effects on rhythm alone, but attenuated the effects of lithium on rhythms. However, lithium did not change the intracellular content of IP6 in NIH3T3 cells or neurons. Pharmacological inhibition of the IP6 kinases (IP6K) increased rhythm amplitude and shortened period, suggesting secondary effects of inositol pyrophosphates may underlie the period shortening effect, but not the amplitude increasing effect of IP6. Overall, we conclude that inositol phosphates, in particular IP6 have effects on circadian rhythms. Manipulations affecting IP6 and related inositol phosphates may offer a novel means through which circadian rhythms can be regulated.",1
"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate whether older adults who have a particularly long sleep duration are likely to exhibit physical frailty, similar to those with a particularly short sleep duration. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: The National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology - Study of Geriatric  Syndromes. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 9,824 older adults (mean age: 73.6 ± 5.5 years, 4,812 men and 5,012 women) met the entry criteria for this study. MEASUREMENTS: We divided the participants into three groups according to self-reported sleep duration (Short: ≤6 h, Mid: 6.1-8.9 h (control), Long: ≥ 9 h). Physical frailty was characterized based on the criteria from the Cardiovascular Health Study. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of sleep duration on physical frailty by sex. RESULTS: Among all participants, the prevalence of physical frailty was higher in the Short (10.5%) and Long (17.9%) groups than in the Mid (7.4%) group (p < 0.001). Multinomial logistic regression analysis showed that both Short and Long  groups had a significantly higher odds ratio (OR) for physical frailty than the Mid group [Short: OR 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-1.87; Long: OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.90-3.00], even after adjusting for age, educational level, number of medications, body mass index, Mini Mental State Examination score, current smoking and alcohol habits, self-perceived health, and medical history. CONCLUSION: Both long and short sleep durations were associated with physical frailty. Further studies are required to confirm the effect of sleep duration on  the incidence or worsening of physical frailty in older adults.",0
"Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) is an important immune protein that is expressed in various brain regions, with its deficiency leading to extensive synaptic transmission that results in learning and memory deficits. Although MHCI is highly expressed in dopaminergic neurons, its role in these neurons has not been examined. We show that MHCI expressed in dopaminergic neurons plays a key role in suppressing reward-seeking behavior. In wild-type mice, cocaine self-administration caused persistent reduction of MHCI specifically in dopaminergic neurons, which was accompanied by enhanced glutamatergic synaptic transmission and relapse to cocaine seeking. Functional MHCI knockout promoted this addictive phenotype for cocaine and a natural reward, namely, sucrose. In contrast, wild-type mice overexpressing a major MHCI gene (H2D) in dopaminergic neurons showed suppressed cocaine seeking. These results show that persistent cocaine-induced reduction of MHCI in dopaminergic neurons is necessary for relapse to cocaine seeking.",0
"Drosophila melanogaster is a common model used to study circadian rhythms in behavior and circadian clocks. However, numerous circadian rhythms have also been detected in non-clock neurons, especially in the first optic neuropil (lamina) of the fly's visual system. Such rhythms have been observed in the number of synapses and in the structure of interneurons, which exhibit changes in size and shape in a circadian manner. Although the patterns of these changes are known, the mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of the TOR signaling pathway and autophagy in regulating circadian rhythms based on the behavior and structural plasticity of the lamina L2 monopolar cell dendritic trees. In addition, we examined the cyclic expression of the TOR signaling pathway (Tor, Pi3K class 1, Akt1) and autophagy (Atg5 and Atg7) genes in the fly's brain. We observed that Tor, Atg5 and Atg7 exhibit rhythmic expressions in the brain of wild-type flies in day/night conditions (LD 12:12) that are abolished in per01 clock mutants. The silencing of Tor in per expressing cells shortens a period of the locomotor activity rhythm of flies. In addition, silencing of the Tor and Atg5 genes in L2 cells disrupts the circadian plasticity of the L2 cell dendritic trees measured in the distal lamina. In turn, silencing of the Atg7 gene in L2 cells changes the pattern of this rhythm. Our results indicate that the TOR signaling pathway and autophagy are involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms in the behavior and plasticity of neurons in the brain of adult flies.",1
"As behavior shows a distinct circadian rhythm, it is hypothesized that circadian rhythms based on zebrafish (Danio rerio) behavior responses could be affected by contaminants in this study, and then the behavior strength of zebrafish exposed to 0.005mg/L Cadmium chloride (CdCl2), 0.01mg/L Dibasic Sodium Phosphate (Na2HPO4), 0.002mg/L deltamethrin, and 0.003mg/L atrazine for 6 days is used to illustrate the possibility of behavior circadian rhythms as an indicator in the environmental stress assessment. Statistical analysis with p<0.01 shows that a clear difference between average values of BS during dark period (AVD) and those during light period (AVL) could be observed, and 24h circadian rhythms do exist in zebrafish behavior responses. Both BS values and circadian rhythms of zebrafish can be affected in the aspect of periodicity with clear time delay, which were 1h delay in CdCl2, 4h delay in Na2HPO4, 4h delay in deltamethrin, and 1h delay in atrazine. Behavior circadian rhythms were disturbed according to the repetitive cycles after autocorrelation analysis, and the toxic effects of different chemicals could be reflected by the profiles of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), which indicated the circadian rhythm disorder in different degrees. These results deduced from the statistical analysis, autocorrelation and SOM strongly supported that circadian rhythms based on zebrafish BS could be used as an indicator in the environmental stress assessment.",1
"BACKGROUND: Glaucoma is currently the second most common cause of severe visual impairment and blindness worldwide. Standard pharmaceutical and surgical interventions often fail to prevent progression of glaucomatous optic neuropathy. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether adjuvantly applied self-relaxation techniques can significantly impact intraocular pressure, ocular perfusion and the overall mental state of affected patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A search of the literature was carried out and a comprehensive overview of currently available data is presented. RESULTS: Autogenic training, hypnosis and music therapy can significantly impact  intraocular pressure, ocular perfusion and overall mental state of patients suffering from glaucoma. CONCLUSION: As all of these adjuvant therapeutic options are cost-effective, available almost everywhere and at anytime as well as without any known side effects, they can be useful additional techniques in the overall concept for treating glaucoma patients. Regular ocular examinations by an ophthalmologist are, however, mandatory.",0
"Researchers have reported two biases in how people recognise and respond to angry and happy facial expressions: (1) a gender-expression bias (Becker et al. in J Pers Soc Psychol, 92(2):179-190, https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.92.2.179 , 2007)-faster identification of male faces as angry and female faces as happy and  (2) an approach-avoidance bias-faster avoidance of people who appear angry and faster approach responses people who appear happy (Heuer et al. in Behav Res The, 45(12):2990-3001, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2007.08.010 2007; Marsh et al. in Emotion, 5(1), 119-124, https://doi.org/10.1037/1528-3542.5.1.119 , 2005; Rotteveel and Phaf in Emotion 4(2):156-172, https://doi.org/10.1037/1528-3542.4.2.156 , 2004). The aim of the current research is to gain insight into the nature of such biases by applying the drift  diffusion model to the results of an approach-avoidance task. Sixty-five participants (33 female) identified faces as either happy or angry by pushing and pulling a joystick. In agreement with the original study of this effect (Solarz 1960) there were clear participant gender differences-both the approach avoidance and gender-expression biases were larger in magnitude for female compared to male participants. The diffusion model results extend recent research (Krypotos et al. in Cogn Emot 29(8):1424-1444, https://doi.org/10.1080/02699931.2014.985635 , 2015) by indicating that the gender-expression and approach-avoidance biases are  mediated by separate cognitive processes.",0
"BACKGROUND Several immunological functions are dependent on circadian rhythms. However, there are still relatively few studies about circadian rhythms in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) and 2D2 transgenic mice. We explore whether 2D2 mice have abnormalities in circadian rhythms and the potential underlying molecular mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS We first observed the wheel-running motion of the control and 2D2 mice using wheel-running measurements. The cytokine levels were also analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the results of clock gene expressions in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) were investigated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR). RESULTS The wheel-running rhythm in 2D2 mice differed from that of the controls. The TNF-alpha and IL-10 rhythms were disrupted in 2D2 mice. Additionally, the rhythm of the clock genes, Per1 and Per2, and expression in the SCN of 2D2 mice were also changed. CONCLUSIONS The results presented here indicate that alteration of circadian rhythms in 2D2 mice affects behavior and immune function, and the potential molecular mechanism might be the Per1 and Per2 expression disorders in the SCN. 2D2 mice might be a suitable model for studying circadian disruption in NMOSD.",1
"Increase in the use of technology has led to an increase in various kinds of technological addictions. A range of psychological and behavioural theories has been proposed to explain technology addictions. These include learning theories,  reward-deficiency hypothesis, impulsivity, cognitive-behavioural models and social skills deficiency theories. While no particular form of psychological intervention has been suggested as being the golden standard for its treatment, the most frequently investigated approaches have been cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and motivational enhancement therapy. Given the need for the use of technology in daily living, controlled use has taken precedence over complete abstinence as the goal of treatment for technology addictions. Therapeutic techniques suggested for internet addiction include practicing the opposite, using external stoppers, setting goals, selective abstinence from certain applications, using cues, making personal inventories, joining support groups and family therapy interventions.",0
"Majority of the physiological processes in the human organism are rhythmic. The most common are the diurnal changes that repeat roughly every 24 hours, called circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms disorders have negative influence on human functioning. The aim of this article is to present the current understanding of the circadian rhythms physiological role, with particular emphasis on the circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (CRSWD), principles of their diagnosis and chronobiological therapy. The guidelines are based on the review of recommendations from the scientific societies involved in sleep medicine and the clinical experiences of the authors. Researchers participating in the preparation of guidelines were invited by the Polish Sleep Research Society and the Section of Biological Psychiatry of the Polish Psychiatric Association, based on their significant contributions in circadian rhythm research and/or clinical experience in the treatment of such disorders. Finally, the guidelines were adjusted to the questions and comments given by the members of both Societies. CRSWD have a significant negative impact on human health and functioning. Standard methods used to assess CRSWD are sleep diaries and sleep logs, while the actigraphy, when available, should be also used. The most effective methods of CRSWD treatment are melatonin administration and light therapy. Behavioral interventions are also recommended. Afourteen-day period of sleep-wake rhythm assessment in CRSWD enables accurate diagnosis, adequate selection of chronobiological interventions, and planning adequate diurnal timing of their application. This type of assessment is quite easy, low-cost, and provides valuable indications how to adjust the therapeutic approach to the circadian phase of the particular patient.",1
"Organisms are believed to have evolved circadian clocks as adaptations to deal with cyclic environmental changes, and therefore it has been hypothesized that evolution in constant environments would lead to regression of such clocks. However, previous studies have yielded mixed results, and evolution of circadian clocks under constant conditions has remained an unsettled topic of debate in circadian biology. In continuation of our previous studies, which reported persistence of circadian rhythms in Drosophila melanogaster populations evolving under constant light, here we intended to examine whether circadian clocks and the associated properties evolve differently under constant light and constant darkness. In this regard, we assayed activity-rest, adult emergence and oviposition rhythms of D. melanogaster populations which have been maintained for over 19 years (~330 generations) under three different light regimes - constant light (LL), light-dark cycles of 12:12 h (LD) and constant darkness (DD). We observed that while circadian rhythms in all the three behaviors persist in both LL and DD stocks with no differences in circadian period, they differed in certain aspects of the entrained rhythms when compared to controls reared in rhythmic environment (LD). Interestingly, we also observed that DD stocks have evolved significantly higher robustness or power of free-running activity-rest and adult emergence rhythms compared to LL stocks. Thus, our study, in addition to corroborating previous results of circadian clock evolution in constant light, also highlights that, contrary to the expected regression of circadian clocks, rearing in constant darkness leads to the evolution of more robust circadian clocks which may be attributed to an intrinsic adaptive advantage of circadian clocks and/or pleiotropic functions of clock genes in other traits.",1
"This study examined how participants' predictions of future memory performance are influenced by emotional facial expressions. Participants made judgements of learning (JOLs) predicting the likelihood that they would correctly identify a face displaying a happy, angry, or neutral emotional expression in a future two-alternative forced-choice recognition test of identity (i.e., recognition that a person's face was seen before). JOLs were higher for studied faces with happy and angry emotional expressions than for neutral faces. However, neutral test faces with studied neutral expressions had significantly higher identity recognition rates than neutral test faces studied with happy or angry expressions. Thus, these data are the first to demonstrate that people believe happy and angry emotional expressions will lead to better identity recognition in the future relative to neutral expressions. This occurred despite the fact that neutral expressions elicited better identity recognition than happy and angry expressions. These findings contribute to the growing literature examining the interaction of cognition and emotion.",0
"Ekman and Friesen (1982) predicted that smiles that express enjoyment would be marked by smoother zygomatic major actions of more consistent duration than the zygomatic major actions of nonenjoyment smiles. Study 1 measured the duration and smoothness of smiles shown by female subjects in response to positive emotion films while alone and in a social interaction. Enjoyment smiles in both situations were of more consistent duration and smoother than nonenjoyment smiles. In Study 2 observers who were shown videotapes of enjoyment and nonenjoyment smiles were able to accurately identify enjoyment smiles at rates greater than chance; moreover, accuracy was positively related to increased salience of orbicularis oculi action. In Study 3, another group of observers were asked to record their impressions of the smiling women shown in Study 2. These women were seen as more positive when they showed enjoyment compared with nonenjoyment smiles. These results provide further evidence that enjoyment smiles are entities distinct from smiles in general.",0
"Protection of fertility shares many of the same concepts as optimization of general health, such as smoking cessation, maintenance of a healthy body weight,  and moderation of alcohol intake. Increasing attention has been placed on minimizing exposures to known reproductive toxicants. There are few conclusive data to support specific diet patterns or supplements for fertility. Ovarian reserve testing has been explored as potential diagnostic tests for assessment of reproductive aging with some controversy. Finally, the development of vitrification in the assisted reproduction laboratory has increased the success and, therefore, access to fertility preservation by way of oocyte or embryo cryopreservation.",0
"Behavioral studies have shown that two different morphed faces perceived as reflecting the same emotional expression are harder to discriminate than two faces considered as two different ones. This advantage of between-categorical differences compared with within-categorical ones is classically referred as the  categorical perception effect. The temporal course of this effect on fear and happiness facial expressions has been explored through event-related potentials (ERPs). Three kinds of pairs were presented in a delayed same-different matching  task: (1) two different morphed faces perceived as the same emotional expression  (within-categorical differences), (2) two other ones reflecting two different emotions (between-categorical differences), and (3) two identical morphed faces (same faces for methodological purpose). Following the second face onset in the pair, the amplitude of the bilateral occipito-temporal negativities (N170) and of the vertex positive potential (P150 or VPP) was reduced for within and same pairs relative to between pairs. This suggests a repetition priming effect. We also observed a modulation of the P3b wave, as the amplitude of the responses for the  between pairs was higher than for the within and same pairs. These results indicate that the categorical perception of human facial emotional expressions has a perceptual origin in the bilateral occipito-temporal regions, while typical prior studies found emotion-modulated ERP components considerably later.",0
"Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to magnetic transcranial stimulation (TCS) were recorded from right abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscles, sharing the same peripheral innervation but engaged in two different motor demands. In seven healthy and trained subjects, the latencies, amplitudes and variability of MEPs were investigated under the following, randomly intermingled, conditions: full muscular and mental relaxation; mental simulation of selective index finger or little finger abduction; mental non-motor activity (arithmetical calculation); and real motor task (little and index finger abduction). The whole procedure was performed by continuous audiovisual monitoring of electromyographic 'silence' in the tested muscles. The maximal facilitatory effects (= latency shortening and amplitude increase) on MEPs were induced by the real motor task. An amplitude potentiation of MEPs in both tested  muscles was present during non-motor mental activity, in comparison to basal values. A further amplitude potentiation, without latency shifts, was confined to the muscle acting as 'prime mover' for the mentally simulated movement, according to the motor program dispatched but not executed by the subject. Similar results  were also found in the F-wave, showing that mental simulation affects spinal motoneuronal excitability as well, although -- due to the lack of MEP and F-wave  latency shift -- the main effect takes place at cortical level. The study shows that movement imagery can focus specific facilitation on the prime-mover muscle for the mentally simulated movement. This is mainly evident on FDI muscle, which  controls fingers (i.e. the index) with highly corticalized motor representation.",0
"PURPOSE: To evaluate whether additive relaxation music (RM) has an adjuvant short-term effect on physiological and psychological parameters in patients with  primary open-angle glaucoma. METHODS: Prospective, randomized clinical trial. Patients in the therapy group (TG) received a 30-minute RM via headphones, whereas members of the control group (CG) did not. Best corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, visual field testing, short- and long-term mental states, and blood levels of different stress hormones were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: A total of 25 (61%)/16 (39%) patients were assigned to the TG/CG. Best corrected visual acuity, daily intraocular pressure, and short-term mental state  (KAB) development were significantly better in the TG in comparison to controls.  Visual field testing, long-term mental well-being (profile of mood states), and adrenalin, cortisol, and endothelin-I blood levels did not differ significantly between both groups. CONCLUSION: Additive RM applied on a daily basis can positively impact various physiological and psychological parameters in the short term.",0
"Inaction inertia occurs when missing an attractive opportunity (vs. not having been offered it) decreases the likelihood of acting on another similar opportunity. We experimentally manipulated future time perspective to reduce inaction inertia. Middle-aged and older adults from the Health and Retirement Study were randomly assigned to imagining restricted or expansive time left to live, or to no instructions. Across age, imagining a restricted future (vs. the other two instructions) reduced inaction inertia and future time perspective. Imagining living longer increased future time perspective among relatively younger participants. Consequences of restricted time perspective for decisions and life regrets are discussed.

"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe and common psychiatric disorder. BD pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and relapses are associated with numerous circadian rhythm abnormalities. Lithium (Li) is the first-line treatment in BD, and its therapeutic action has been related to its ability to alter circadian rhythms. We systematically searched the PubMed database until January 2016, aiming to critically examine published studies investigating direct and indirect effects of Li on circadian rhythms. The results, from the 95 retained studies, indicated that Li: acts directly on the molecular clocks; delays the phase of sleep-wakefulness rhythms and the peak elevation of diurnal cycle body temperature; reduces the amplitude and shortens the duration of activity rhythms and lengthens free-running rhythms. Chronic Li treatment stabilizes free-running activity rhythms, by improving day-to-day rhythmicity of the activity, with effects that appear to be dose related. Pharmacogenetics demonstrate several associations of Li's response with circadian genes (NR1D1, GSK3beta, CRY1, ARNTL, TIM, PER2). Finally, Li acts on the retinal-hypothalamic pineal pathway, influencing light sensitivity and melatonin secretion. Li is a highly investigated chronobiologic agent, and although its chronobiological effects are not completely understood, it seems highly likely that they constitute an inherent component of its therapeutic action in the treatment of mood disorders.",1
"The distribution of attention in both space and time is critical for processing our dynamic environment. Studies of spatial attention suggest that the distribution of attention is decreased when the perceptual load of a task increases, resulting in decreased processing of task-irrelevant distractors. Studies of the attentional blink (AB) suggest that the temporal distribution of attention also influences distractor processing, such that distractor processing  increases during the AB relative to outside the AB (Jiang & Chun, 2001). Two experiments are reported in which the extent to which the difficulty of the first target task (T1) modulates the processing of task-irrelevant distractors during the AB was tested. To investigate this issue, both the first and second target tasks (T1 and T2) required identifying a central stimulus that was flanked by low-load or high-load distractors. Consistent with previous studies of the AB, there was evidence of more distractor processing during the AB than outside the AB. Critically, however, the interference caused by distractors presented simultaneously with T2 during the AB was reduced when T1 perceptual load was high relative to when it was low. These results suggest that increasing T1 perceptual  load decreases distractor processing during the AB and that perceptual processes  influence both the temporal and spatial distribution of attention.",0
"Lithium is widely used as a treatment of bipolar disorder, a neuropsychiatric disorder associated with disrupted circadian rhythms. Lithium is known to lengthen period and increase amplitude of circadian rhythms. One possible pathway for these effects involves inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), which regulates degradation of CRY2, a canonical clock protein determining circadian period. CRY1 is also known to play important roles in regulating circadian period and phase, although there is no evidence that it is similarly phosphorylated by GSK-3beta. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that lithium affects circadian rhythms through CRYs. We cultured fibroblasts and slices of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master circadian pacemaker of the brain, from Cry1-/-, Cry2-/-, or wild-type (WT) mice bearing the PER2:LUC circadian reporter. Lithium was applied in the culture medium, and circadian rhythms of PER2 expression were measured. In WT and Cry2-/- fibroblasts, 10mM lithium increased PER2 expression and rhythm amplitude but not period, and 1mM lithium did not affect either period or amplitude. In non-rhythmic Cry1-/- fibroblasts, 10mM lithium increased PER2 expression. In SCN slices, 1mM lithium lengthened period approximately 1h in all genotypes, but did not affect amplitude except in Cry2-/- SCN. Thus, the amplitude-enhancing effect of lithium in WT fibroblasts was unaffected by Cry2 knockout and occurred in the absence of period-lengthening, whereas the period-lengthening effect of lithium in WT SCN was unaffected by Cry1 or Cry2 knockout and occurred in the absence of rhythm amplification, suggesting that these two effects of lithium on circadian rhythms are independent of CRYs and of each other.",1
"Circadian rhythms influence virtually every aspect of behavior. This special issue provides updates on the current state and future directions for the field of circadian rhythms in behavioral neuroscience. Recent data have linked circadian rhythms to behavioral and physiological phenomena and disease states in virtually every area of behavioral and biomedical science. Specifically, a growing interest in the cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and metabolic consequences of circadian rhythm disorders and dysfunction is emerging. This special issue is not intended to provide an exhaustive overview of the entire field of chronobiology or behavioral rhythms. Instead, we invited researchers from a variety of fields to critically review and integrate studies that address the roles of circadian rhythms in behavioral neuroscience. The papers included in this issue range from the molecular biology of clock genes to the behavior of free-living animals, and cover a wide variety of species ranging from insects, to rodents, to humans. As such, the reviews provide an overview of the burgeoning field of circadian rhythms within behavioral neuroscience.",1
"It was examined how ventral striatum responses to rewards develop across adolescence and early adulthood and how individual differences in state- and trait-level reward sensitivity are related to these changes. Participants (aged 8-29 years) were tested across three waves separated by 2 years (693 functional MRI scans) in an accelerated longitudinal design. The results confirmed an adolescent peak in reward-related ventral striatum, specifically nucleus accumbens, activity. In early to mid-adolescence, increases in reward activation  were related to trait-level reward drive. In mid-adolescence to early adulthood decreases in reward activation were related to decreases in state-level hedonic reward pleasure. This study demonstrates that state- and trait-level reward sensitivity account for reward-related ventral striatum activity in different phases of adolescence and early adulthood.",0
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The endogenous circadian rhythms are one of the cardinal processes that control sleep. They are self-sustaining biological rhythms with a periodicity of approximately 24 hours that may be entrained by external zeitgebers (German for time givers), such as light, exercise, and meal times. This article discusses the physiology of the circadian rhythms, their relationship to neurologic disease, and the presentation and treatment of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Classic examples of circadian rhythms include cortisol and melatonin secretion, body temperature, and urine volume. More recently, the impact of circadian rhythm on several neurologic disorders has been investigated, such as the timing of occurrence of epileptic seizures as well as neurobehavioral functioning in dementia. Further updates include a more in-depth understanding of the symptoms, consequences, and treatment of circadian sleep-wake disorders, which may occur because of extrinsic misalignment with clock time or because of intrinsic dysfunction of the brain. An example of extrinsic misalignment occurs with jet lag during transmeridian travel or with intrinsic circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders such as advanced or delayed sleep-wake phase disorders. In advanced sleep-wake phase disorder, which is most common in elderly individuals, sleep onset and morning arousal are undesirably early, leading to impaired evening function with excessive sleepiness and sleep-maintenance insomnia with early morning awakening. By contrast, delayed sleep-wake phase disorder is characterized by an inability to initiate sleep before the early morning hours, with subsequent delayed rise time, leading to clinical symptoms of severe sleep-onset insomnia coupled with excessive daytime sleepiness in the morning hours, as patients are unable to ""sleep in"" to attain sufficient sleep quantity. Irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder is misentrainment with patches of brief sleep and wakefulness spread throughout the day, leading to unstable sleep and waking behavioral patterns and an entirely idiosyncratic sleep-wake schedule. SUMMARY: Familiarity with these major circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder phenotypes and their overlap with other neurologic disorders is essential for the neurologist so that clinicians may intervene and improve patient functioning and quality of life.",1
"Abstraction allows us to discern regularities beyond the specific instances we encounter. It also promotes creative problem-solving by enabling us to consider unconventional problem solutions. However, the mechanisms by which this occurs are not well understood. Because it is often difficult to isolate human high-level cognitive processes, we utilized a nonhuman primate model, in which rhesus monkeys appear to use similar processes to consider an unconventional solution to the difficult reverse-reward problem: i.e., given the choice between  a better and worse food option they must select the worse one to receive the better one. After solving this problem with only one specific example-one vs. four half-peanuts-three of four monkeys immediately transferred to novel cases: novel quantities, food items, non-food items, and to the choice between a larger, but inferior vegetable and a smaller, but superior food item (either grape or marshmallow), in which they selected the inferior vegetable to receive the superior option. Thus, we show that nonhuman animals have the capacity to comprehend abstract non-perceptual features, to infer them from one specific case, and to use them to override the natural preference to select the superior option. Critically, we also found that three monkeys had a large learning and performance advantage over the fourth monkey who showed less generalization from  the original one and four half-peanuts. This difference suggests that abstraction promoted problem-solving via cascading activation from the two food item options  to the relation between them, thus providing access to an initially nonapparent problem solution.",0
"OBJECTIVE: To provide health care organizations with strategies for decreasing the prevalence of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers. DESIGN: Hospital-acquired pressure ulcer prevalence was measured every 6 months for 4.5 years while multiple strategies were implemented. SETTING: The study took place in a not-for-profit, 548-bed, 2-hospital system in  Southwest Florida. PATIENTS: All adult patients with the exception of those admitted for obstetric or mental health care. INTERVENTIONS: An assortment of interventions were implemented, including electronic medical records, risk assessment tied to automatic consults, pressure  relief measures including new equipment and personnel augmentation, and an interdisciplinary team to decide on protocols. MAIN RESULTS: Hospital-acquired prevalence rate for all pressure ulcers was reduced by 81%. The rate for heel ulcers alone was reduced by 90%. CONCLUSION: A pressure ulcer prevention program has been developed, which has shown a trend toward improved patient outcomes with a resultant cost savings.",0
"The experience of positive emotion is closely linked to subjective well-being. For this reason, campaigns aimed at promoting the value of positive emotion have  become widespread. What is rarely considered are the cultural implications of this focus on happiness. Promoting positive emotions as important for ""the good life"" not only has implications for how individuals value these emotional states, but for how they believe others around them value these emotions also. Drawing on data from over 9,000 college students across 47 countries we examined whether individuals' life satisfaction is associated with living in contexts in which positive emotions are socially valued. The findings show that people report more  life satisfaction in countries where positive emotions are highly valued and this is linked to an increased frequency of positive emotional experiences in these contexts. They also reveal, however, that increased life satisfaction in countries that place a premium on positive emotion is less evident for people who tend to experience less valued emotional states: people who experience many negative emotions, do not flourish to the same extent in these contexts. The findings demonstrate how the cultural value placed on certain emotion states may  shape the relationship between emotional experiences and subjective well-being.",0
"The advantages of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, including low genetic redundancy, functional simplicity, and the ability to conduct large-scale genetic screens, have been essential for understanding the molecular nature of circadian ( approximately 24 hr) rhythms, and continue to be valuable in discovering novel regulators of circadian rhythms and sleep. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of these interrelated biological processes in Drosophila and the wider implications of this research. Clock genes period and timeless were first discovered in large-scale Drosophila genetic screens developed in the 1970s. Feedback of period and timeless on their own transcription forms the core of the molecular clock, and accurately timed expression, localization, post-transcriptional modification, and function of these genes is thought to be critical for maintaining the circadian cycle. Regulators, including several phosphatases and kinases, act on different steps of this feedback loop to ensure strong and accurately timed rhythms. Approximately 150 neurons in the fly brain that contain the core components of the molecular clock act together to translate this intracellular cycling into rhythmic behavior. We discuss how different groups of clock neurons serve different functions in allowing clocks to entrain to environmental cues, driving behavioral outputs at different times of day, and allowing flexible behavioral responses in different environmental conditions. The neuropeptide PDF provides an important signal thought to synchronize clock neurons, although the details of how PDF accomplishes this function are still being explored. Secreted signals from clock neurons also influence rhythms in other tissues. SLEEP is, in part, regulated by the circadian clock, which ensures appropriate timing of sleep, but the amount and quality of sleep are also determined by other mechanisms that ensure a homeostatic balance between sleep and wake. Flies have been useful for identifying a large set of genes, molecules, and neuroanatomic loci important for regulating sleep amount. Conserved aspects of sleep regulation in flies and mammals include wake-promoting roles for catecholamine neurotransmitters and involvement of hypothalamus-like regions, although other neuroanatomic regions implicated in sleep in flies have less clear parallels. Sleep is also subject to regulation by factors such as food availability, stress, and social environment. We are beginning to understand how the identified molecules and neurons interact with each other, and with the environment, to regulate sleep. Drosophila researchers can also take advantage of increasing mechanistic understanding of other behaviors, such as learning and memory, courtship, and aggression, to understand how sleep loss impacts these behaviors. Flies thus remain a valuable tool for both discovery of novel molecules and deep mechanistic understanding of sleep and circadian rhythms.",1
"Psychiatric disorders are significantly common complications among patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Affective temperament is a concept of core personality traits, which can decribe the vulnerability to mood disorders, therefore its evaluation might convey useful information about patients' mental status in autoimmune disorders. The aim of the study was to evaluate the affective temperament in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) as characteristic features of these diseases, but also in the clinical course and the severity of anxiety and depression.Due to our knowledge this is the first study of this kind. The study enrolled 130 patients with IBD, including 68 with CD and 62 with UC. We used TEMPS-A to evaluate affective temperament and HADS scales to assess the intensity of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Harvey Bradshaw scale, Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and Mayo Score were used to evaluate clinical severity of the diseases. We observed significantly higher prevalence of depressive, cyclothymic and anxiety temperaments in CD patients compared to the control group. Harvey Bradshaw scale, CDAI and Mayo Self Report showed statistically significant outcomes, including significant positive correlations with depressive, cyclothymic and anxiety subscales of TEMPS-A, and negative correlation with the hyperthymic temperament in CD subjects. Our findings indicate significant differences between CD and UC due to temperament traits, and suggest distinct pathogenesis of mood disorders in IBD.",0

"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of treatment with rituximab plus methotrexate on patient-reported outcomes in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who experienced inadequate response to anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. METHODS: Patients with active RA were randomly assigned to rituximab (1,000 mg on days 1 and 15) or placebo. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with an American College of Rheumatology 20% response at week 24. Additional goals were to assess treatment effects on pain, fatigue, functional disability, health-related quality of life, and disease activity by comparing mean changes between groups. The analysis was conducted in the intent-to-treat population. The proportion of patients who achieved the minimum clinically important difference on the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) disability index (DI), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), and Short Form 36 (SF-36) was determined. RESULTS: Rituximab patients had statistically significantly greater pain relief.  The FACIT-F showed significantly greater improvement in rituximab patients than placebo patients from weeks 12 through 24. Mean improvement from baseline in functional disability (measured by the HAQ DI) was significantly greater in rituximab patients from weeks 8 to 24. The mean +/- SD change from baseline for the SF-36 Physical Component Score was 6.64 +/- 8.74 for rituximab patients and 1.48 +/- 7.32 for placebo patients (P < 0.0001). The mean change from baseline for the SF-36 Mental Component Score was 5.32 +/- 12.41 for rituximab patients and 2.25 +/- 12.23 for placebo patients (P = 0.0269). CONCLUSION: Rituximab produced rapid, clinically meaningful, and statistically significant improvements in patient-reported pain, fatigue, functional disability, health-related quality of life, and disease activity. These effects were sustained throughout the study.",0
"OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the oral health condition of pregnant/postpartum women attending public services in the city of Feira de Santana, BA, Brazil, at three different times between 2005 and 2015. METHODS: this is a study socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, health condition and health care, lifestyle and oral health status of 1,245 participants obtained from a database of three previous investigations: I Intervention Study (2005-2007); II Case-Control Study (2010-2011); III Case-Control Study (2012-2015). RESULTS: comparing the three periods, the frequency of gingivitis (24.41% versus  8.90% versus 5.77%; p<0.01) and periodontitis (44.64% vs 9.16% vs 11.55%; p<0.01) was found to decrease; the worst dental conditions regarding the number of teeth  present, healthy and extracted and the DMFT index were found in period III compared to period II. CONCLUSION: an improvement was seen in the participants' periodontal condition over time, which coincides with the implementation of policies pertaining to women's health, oral health and income redistribution in this city.",0
"Stress plays a critical role in the neurobiology of mood and anxiety disorders. Sleep and circadian rhythms are affected in many of these conditions. Here we examined the effects of chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), an ethological form of stress, on sleep and circadian rhythms. We exposed male mice implanted with wireless telemetry transmitters to a 10 day CSDS regimen known to produce anhedonia (a depressive-like effect) and social avoidance (an anxiety-like effect). EEG, EMG, body temperature, and locomotor activity data were collected continuously during the CSDS regimen and a 5 day recovery period. CSDS affected numerous endpoints, including paradoxical sleep (PS) and slow-wave sleep (SWS), as well as the circadian rhythmicity of body temperature and locomotor activity. The magnitude of the effects increased with repeated stress, and some changes (PS bouts, SWS time, body temperature, locomotor activity) persisted after the CSDS regimen had ended. CSDS also altered mRNA levels of the circadian rhythm-related gene mPer2 within brain areas that regulate motivation and emotion. Administration of the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist JDTic (30 mg/kg, i.p.) before CSDS reduced stress effects on both sleep and circadian rhythms, or hastened their recovery, and attenuated changes in mPer2 Our findings show that CSDS produces persistent disruptions in sleep and circadian rhythmicity, mimicking attributes of stress-related conditions as they appear in humans. The ability of KOR antagonists to mitigate these disruptions is consistent with previously reported antistress effects. Studying homologous endpoints across species may facilitate the development of improved treatments for psychiatric illness.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Stress plays a critical role in the neurobiology of mood and anxiety disorders. We show that chronic social defeat stress in mice produces progressive alterations in sleep and circadian rhythms that resemble features of depression as it appears in humans. Whereas some of these alterations recover quickly upon cessation of stress, others persist. Administration of a kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist reduced stress effects or hastened recovery, consistent with the previously reported antistress effects of this class of agents. Use of endpoints, such as sleep and circadian rhythm, that are homologous across species will facilitate the implementation of translational studies that better predict clinical outcomes in humans, improve the success of clinical trials, and facilitate the development of more effective therapeutics.",1
"Shift work comprises work schedules that extend beyond the typical ""nine-to-five"" workday, wherein schedules often comprise early work start, compressed work weeks with 12-hour shifts, and night work. According to recent American and European surveys, between 15 and 30% of adult workers are engaged in some type of shift work, with 19% of the European population reportedly working at least 2 hours between 22:00 and 05:00. The 2005 International Classification of Sleep Disorders estimates that a shift work sleep disorder can be found in 2-5% of workers. This disorder is characterized by excessive sleepiness and/or sleep disruption for at least one month in relation with the atypical work schedule. Individual tolerance to shift work remains a complex problem that is affected by the number of consecutive work hours and shifts, the rest periods, and the predictability of work schedules. Sleepiness usually occurs during night shifts and is maximal at the end of the night. Impaired vigilance and performance occur around times of increased sleepiness and can seriously compromise workers' health and safety. Indeed, workers suffering from a shift work sleep-wake disorder can fall asleep involuntarily at work or while driving back home after a night shift. Working on atypical shifts has important socioeconomic impacts as it leads to an increased risk of accidents, workers' impairment and danger to public safety, especially at night. The aim of the present review is to review the circadian and sleep-wake disturbances associated with shift work as well as their medical impacts.",1
"Outside of western countries, the study of the local food environment and evidence for its association with dietary behavior is limited. The aim of this paper was to examine the association between the local retail food environment and consumption of fruit and vegetables (FV) among adults in Hong Kong. Local retail food environment was measured by density of different types of retail food outlets (grocery stores, convenience stores, and fast food restaurants) within a  1000 m Euclidean buffer around individual's homes using a geographic information  system (GIS). The Retail Food Environment Index (RFEI) was calculated based on the relative density of fast-food restaurants and convenience stores to grocery stores. Logistic regressions were performed to examine associations using cross-sectional data of 1977 adults (18 years or older). Overall, people living in an area with the highest RFEI (Q4, >5.76) had significantly greater odds of infrequent FV consumption (<7 days/week) after covariates adjustment (infrequent  fruit consumption: OR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.04⁻1.78; infrequent vegetable consumption: OR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.11⁻2.68) in comparison to the lowest RFEI (Q1, <2.25). Highest density of fast food restaurants (Q4, >53) was also significantly associated with greater odds of infrequent fruit consumption (<7 days/week) (unadjusted model: OR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.04⁻1.73), relative to lowest density of fast food restaurants (Q1, <13). No significant association of density of grocery stores or convenience stores was observed with infrequent FV consumption regardless of the covariates included in the model. Our results suggest that the  ratio of fast-food restaurants and convenience stores to grocery stores near people's home is an important environmental factor in meeting fruit and vegetable consumption guidelines. ""Food swamps"" (areas with an abundance of unhealthy foods) rather than ""food deserts"" (areas where there is limited access to healthy foods) seems to be more of a problem in Hong Kong's urban areas. We advanced international literature by providing evidence in a non-western setting.",0
"Two groups of 20 subjects with elevated muscle tension levels were provided with  either contingent (Group 1) or false (Group 2) EMG feedback from the frontalis muscle. Each group received 8 sessions of identical length. Performance of the 2  groups over the final training session was compared. Group 1 showed a marked decrease in frontalis EMG levels over Session 8 whereas Group 2 showed no change  in frontalis activity. However, both groups showed a significant increase in reported feelings of relaxation with no difference between groups. To investigate the possibility that subjects attaining very low frontalis levels might show a more marked subjective response, 10 subjects from Group 1 who showed the most marked decrease in EMG activity were compared with the 10 subjects from Group 2 who showed the least decrease. Although both showed an increase in mental relaxation, there was no difference between the groups.",0
"The timing, duration, and consolidation of sleep result from the interaction of the circadian timing system with a sleep-wake homeostatic process. When aligned and functioning optimally, this allows wakefulness throughout the day and a long consolidated sleep episode at night. Mismatch between the desired timing of sleep and the ability to fall and remain asleep is a hallmark of the circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. This article discusses changes in circadian regulation of sleep with aging; how age influences the prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders; and how neurologic diseases in older patients affect circadian rhythms and sleep.",1
"Cardiotrophin (CT)-1 is a regulator of glucose and lipid homeostasis. In the present study, we analyzed whether CT-1 also acts to peripherally regulate metabolic rhythms and adipose tissue core clock genes in mice. Moreover, the circadian pattern of plasma CT-1 levels was evaluated in normal-weight and overweight subjects. The circadian rhythmicity of oxygen consumption rate (Vo2) was disrupted in aged obese CT-1-deficient (CT-1(-/-)) mice (12 mo). Although circadian rhythms of Vo2 were conserved in young lean CT-1(-/-) mice (2 mo), CT-1 deficiency caused a phase shift of the acrophase. Most of the clock genes studied (Clock, Bmal1, and Per2) displayed a circadian rhythm in adipose tissue of both wild-type (WT) and CT-1(-/-) mice. However, the pattern was altered in CT-1(-/-) mice toward a lower percentage of the rhythm or lower amplitude, especially for Bmal1 and Clock. Moreover, CT-1 mRNA levels in adipose tissue showed significant circadian fluctuations in young WT mice. In humans, CT-1 plasma profile exhibited a 24-h circadian rhythm in normal-weight but not in overweight subjects. The 24-h pattern of CT-1 was characterized by a pronounced increase during the night (from 02:00 to 08:00). These observations suggest a potential role for CT-1 in the regulation of metabolic circadian rhythms.-Lopez-Yoldi, M., Stanhope, K. L., Garaulet, M., Chen, X.

"Intonation is a vehicle for communication, which sometimes contributes greater meaning than the semantic content of speech itself. This prosodic element lends the message linguistic and paralinguistic meaning, which carries a highly significant communicative value when conveying emotional states. For this reason, this article analyses the use of intonation as an instrument for arousing various sensations in the listener. The aim was to verify which elements of intonation are more decisive to generate a specific sensation. Experimental research is conducted, in which certain pitch patterns (pitch levels and contour type) are assigned different emotions (joy, anxiety, sadness, and calmness) and are then listened to and assessed using a questionnaire with a bipolar scale of opposed pairs, by a sample audience comprising 100 individuals. The main conclusion drawn is that, although both the variables analyzed--pitch level and contour type--are  representative of expressing emotions, contour type is more decisive. In all the  models analyzed, contour type has been highly significant and constitutes the variable that has been determined as the final component for recognizing various  emotions.",0
"Women often experience sleep disturbances and worsening sleep quality throughout pregnancy and postpartum. Circadian rhythms are closely linked to sleep problems and mood disorders. This systematic review provides a summary of studies of circadian rhythms and associated sleep problems and maternal distress, among postpartum women. Articles were idenitfied through a systematic literature search. Circadian rhythm disturbances were strongly correlated with depression, social factors and mothers`s exposure to light postpartum. Future research should include larger, prospective studies as well as randomized controlled trials for measuring effect of circadian rhythm interventions on postpartum mental health outcomes.",1
"The hypocretin/orexin (HCRT) neuropeptide system regulates feeding, arousal state, stress responses, and reward, especially under conditions of enhanced motivational relevance. In particular, HCRT neurotransmission facilitates drug-seeking behavior in circumstances that demand increased effort and/or motivation to take the drug. The present study used a shRNA-encoding adeno-associated viral vector to knockdown Hcrt expression throughout the dorsal  hypothalamus in adult rats and determine the role of HCRT in cocaine self-administration. Chronic Hcrt silencing did not impact cocaine self-administration under short-access conditions, but robustly attenuated cocaine intake under extended access conditions, a model that mimics key features of compulsive cocaine taking. In addition, Hcrt silencing decreased motivation for both cocaine and a highly palatable food reward (i.e., sweetened condensed milk; SCM) under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement, but did not alter responding for SCM under a fixed ratio schedule. Importantly, Hcrt silencing did  not affect food or water consumption, and had no consequence for general measures of arousal and stress reactivity. At the molecular level, chronic Hcrt knockdown  reduced the number of neurons expressing dynorphin (DYN), and to a smaller extent melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), in the dorsal hypothalamus. These original findings support the hypothesis that HCRT neurotransmission promotes operant responding for both drug and non-drug rewards, preferentially under conditions requiring a high degree of motivation. Furthermore, the current study provides compelling evidence for the involvement of the HCRT system in cocaine self-administration also under low-effort conditions in rats allowed extended access, possibly via functional interactions with DYN and MCH signaling.",0
"BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is associated with disturbed circadian rhythms. To investigate the causal relationship between mood disorders and circadian clock disruption, previous studies in animal models have employed light/dark manipulations, global mutations of clock genes, or brain area lesions. However, light can impact mood by noncircadian mechanisms; clock genes have pleiotropic, clock-independent functions; and brain lesions not only disrupt cellular circadian rhythms but also destroy cells and eliminate important neuronal connections, including light reception pathways. Thus, a definitive causal role for functioning circadian clocks in mood regulation has not been established. METHODS: We stereotactically injected viral vectors encoding short hairpin RNA to knock down expression of the essential clock gene Bmal1 into the brain's master circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). RESULTS: In these SCN-specific Bmal1-knockdown (SCN-Bmal1-KD) mice, circadian rhythms were greatly attenuated in the SCN, while the mice were maintained in a standard light/dark cycle, SCN neurons remained intact, and neuronal connections were undisturbed, including photic inputs. In the learned helplessness paradigm, the SCN-Bmal1-KD mice were slower to escape, even before exposure to inescapable stress. They also spent more time immobile in the tail suspension test and less time in the lighted section of a light/dark box. The SCN-Bmal1-KD mice also showed greater weight gain, an abnormal circadian pattern of corticosterone, and an attenuated increase of corticosterone in response to stress. CONCLUSIONS: Disrupting SCN circadian rhythms is sufficient to cause helplessness, behavioral despair, and anxiety-like behavior in mice, establishing SCN-Bmal1-KD mice as a new animal model of depression.",1
"Background: Despite the inclusion of adolescent health in recent global frameworks, limited data exist on health indicators in low-income countries. Our  objective was to identify socioeconomic measures, risk behaviors and health indicators of young people in Guatemala. Methods: We conducted a secondary data analysis of the Pan American Health Organization's Sistema Informático del Adolescente of 2831 participants ages 10-24 y from 2008 to 2014. We examined frequencies for a core set of items, and generalized regression models assessed correlations between age, sex and ethnicity with health outcomes of interest. Results: Fewer than 17% of participants reported a history of chronic illness (16.6%) and severe psychological problems (16.8%). While 66.1% of participants' mothers and 36.6% of fathers reported job instability, far fewer families had housing instability (1.9% with no electricity, 6.3% with no running water). Fewer than one-third (29.1%) were sexually active and the majority (76.0%) routinely used condoms. About one-quarter (22.6%) reported abnormal mood. Indigenous participants were significantly more likely to have experienced psychological problems (odds ratio [OR] 1.75 [confidence interval {CI} 1.65-1.86]) and violence (OR 1.34 [CI 1.27-1.42]) compared with whites. Conclusions: The prevalence of risk behaviors and mental health concerns is low compared with other sources of national and regional data. Further work is needed to examine the benefits and limitations of this system in order to improve health surveillance.",0
"One known risk factor for drug use and abuse is sensitivity to rewarding effects  of drugs. It is not known whether this risk factor extends to sensitivity to non-drug rewards. In this study with healthy young adults, we examined the association between sensitivity to the subjective rewarding effects of amphetamine and a neural indicator of anticipation of monetary reward. We hypothesized that greater euphorigenic response to amphetamine would be associated with greater neural activation to anticipation of monetary reward (Win > Loss). Healthy participants (N = 61) completed four laboratory sessions in which they received d-amphetamine (20 mg) and placebo in alternating order, providing self-report measures of euphoria and stimulation at regular intervals.  At a separate visit 1-3 weeks later, participants completed the guessing reward task (GRT) during fMRI in a drug-free state. Participants reporting greater euphoria after amphetamine also exhibited greater neural activation during monetary reward anticipation in mesolimbic reward regions, including the bilateral caudate and putamen. This is the first study to show a relationship between neural correlates of monetary reward and sensitivity to the subjective rewarding effects of amphetamine in humans. These findings support growing evidence that sensitivity to reward in general is a risk factor for drug use and  abuse, and suggest that sensitivity of drug-induced euphoria may reflect a general sensitivity to rewards. This may be an index of vulnerability for drug use or abuse.",0
"INTRODUCTION: Circadian rhythms regulate much of gastrointestinal physiology including cell proliferation, motility, digestion, absorption, and electrolyte balance. Disruption of circadian rhythms can have adverse consequences including the promotion of and/or exacerbation of a wide variety of gastrointestinal disorders and diseases. Areas covered: In this review, we evaluate some of the many gastrointestinal functions that are regulated by circadian rhythms and how dysregulation of these functions may contribute to disease. This review also discusses some common gastrointestinal disorders that are known to be influenced by circadian rhythms as well as speculation about the mechanisms by which circadian rhythm disruption promotes dysfunction and disease pathogenesis. We discuss how knowledge of circadian rhythms and the advent of chrono-nutrition, chrono-pharmacology, and chrono-therapeutics might influence clinical practice. Expert opinion: As our knowledge of circadian biology increases, it may be possible to incorporate strategies that take advantage of circadian rhythms and chronotherapy to prevent and/or treat disease.",1
"We studied circadian rhythms of body temperature and locomotor activity in antelope ground squirrels (Ammospermophilus leucurus) under laboratory conditions of a 12L:12D light-dark cycle and in constant darkness. Antelope ground squirrels are diurnally active and, exceptionally among ground squirrels and other closely related members of the squirrel family in general, they do not hibernate. Daily oscillations in body temperature consisted of a rise in temperature during the daytime activity phase of the circadian cycle and a decrease in temperature during the nighttime rest phase. The body temperature rhythms were robust (71% of maximal strength) with a daily range of oscillation of 4.6 degrees C, a daytime mean of 38.7 degrees C, and a nighttime mean of 34.1 degrees C (24-h overall mean 36.4 degrees C). The body temperature rhythm persisted in continuous darkness with a free-running period of 24.2h. This pattern is similar to that of hibernating species of ground squirrels but with a wave form more similar to that of non-hibernating rodents. Daily oscillations in body temperature were correlated with individual bouts of activity, but daytime temperatures were higher than nighttime temperatures even when comparing short episodes of nocturnal activity that were as intense as diurnal activity. This suggests that although muscular thermogenesis associated with locomotor activity can modify the level of body temperature, the circadian rhythm of body temperature is not simply a consequence of the circadian rhythm of activity.",1
"PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to determine which sleep-related behaviors are most often used by the elderly according to the presence or absence of anxiety and mood disorders. In particular, we are attempting to determine whether these behaviors are associated with the probability of suffering from a mental disorder. The behaviors being examined in the present study are taking naps, television watching or reading at bedtime, physical exercise at bedtime, relaxing activities at bedtime, and caffeine consumption in the evening. METHODS: The sample in this study consists of 2,759 participants aged 65 and over, with a mean age of 73.8. They were recruited through a method of random generation of telephone numbers according to a sampling strategy based on geographic location. After the goal of the study was explained to them, the participants agreed to have health professionals visit their home and to answer questions in an hour-and-a-half-long structured interview (after signing a consent form). RESULTS: Taking naps is the activity most often practiced by the elderly. Watching television and reading at bedtime are also frequent practices among them. The probabilities of suffering from anxiety are greater if the person never or rarely consumes caffeine after 6 pm, if the individual takes naps during the day, or if the person practices relaxation before bedtime. Television watching, reading, and physical exercise before bedtime are activities that are not associated with the probability of suffering from a mental disorder. CONCLUSION: It would be beneficial for research to be conducted to support the findings on behavioral differences between depressive and anxious seniors so that these behaviors can become further indicators of the presence of mental disorders.",0
"In recent years, strong evidence has emerged suggesting that insufficient duration, quality, and/or timing of sleep are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), and various mechanisms for this association have been proposed. Such associations may be related to endophenotypic features of the sleep homeostat and the circadian oscillator, or may be state-like effects of the environment. Here, we review recent literature on sleep, circadian rhythms and CVD with a specific emphasis on differences between racial/ethnic groups. We discuss the reported differences, mainly between individuals of European and African descent, in parameters related to sleep (architecture, duration, quality) and circadian rhythms (period length and phase shifting). We further review racial/ethnic differences in cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, and develop the hypothesis that racial/ethnic health disparities may, to a greater or smaller degree, relate to differences in parameters related to sleep and circadian rhythms. When humans left Africa some 100,000 years ago, some genetic differences between different races/ethnicities were acquired. These genetic differences have been proposed as a possible predictor of CVD disparities, but concomitant differences in culture and lifestyle between different groups may equally explain CVD disparities. We discuss the evidence for genetic and environmental causes of these differences in sleep and circadian rhythms, and their usefulness as health intervention targets.",1
"BACKGROUND: Individuals with psychotic disorders experience disruptions to both the sleep and circadian components of the sleep/wake cycle. Recent evidence has supported a role of sleep disturbances in emerging psychosis. However, less is known about how circadian rhythm disruptions may relate to psychosis symptoms and prognosis for adolescents with clinical high-risk (CHR) syndromes. The present study examines circadian rest/activity rhythms in CHR and healthy control (HC) youth to clarify the relationships among circadian rhythm disturbance, psychosis symptoms, psychosocial functioning, and the longitudinal course of illness. METHODS: Thirty-four CHR and 32 HC participants were administered a baseline evaluation, which included clinical interviews, 5days of actigraphy, and a sleep/activity diary. CHR (n=29) participants were re-administered clinical interviews at a 1-year follow-up assessment. RESULTS: Relative to HC, CHR youth exhibited more fragmented circadian rhythms and later onset of nocturnal rest. Circadian disturbances (fragmented rhythms, low daily activity) were associated with increased psychotic symptom severity among CHR participants at baseline. Circadian disruptions (lower daily activity, rhythms that were more fragmented and/or desynchronized with the light/dark cycle) also predicted severity of psychosis symptoms and psychosocial impairment at 1-year follow-up among CHR youth. CONCLUSIONS: Circadian rhythm disturbances may represent a potential vulnerability marker for emergence of psychosis, and thus, rest/activity rhythm stabilization has promise to inform early-identification and prevention/intervention strategies for CHR youth. Future studies with longer study designs are necessary to further examine circadian rhythms in the prodromal period and rates of conversion to psychosis among CHR teens.",1
"Computational models of reinforcement learning have helped dissect discrete components of reward-related function and characterize neurocognitive deficits in psychiatric illnesses. Stimulus novelty biases decision-making, even when unrelated to choice outcome, acting as if possessing intrinsic reward value to guide decisions toward uncertain options. Heightened novelty seeking is characteristic of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, yet how this influences reward-related decision-making is computationally encoded, or is altered by stimulant medication, is currently uncertain. Here we used an established reinforcement-learning task to model effects of novelty on reward-related behaviour during functional MRI in 30 adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and 30 age-, sex- and IQ-matched control subjects. Each participant was tested on two separate occasions, once ON and once OFF stimulant medication. OFF medication, patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder showed significantly impaired task performance (P = 0.027), and greater selection of novel options (P = 0.004). Moreover, persistence in selecting novel options predicted impaired task performance (P = 0.025). These behavioural deficits were accompanied by a significantly lower learning rate (P = 0.011) and heightened novelty signalling within the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (family-wise error corrected P < 0.05). Compared to effects in controls, stimulant medication improved attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  participants' overall task performance (P = 0.011), increased reward-learning rates (P = 0.046) and enhanced their ability to differentiate optimal from non-optimal novel choices (P = 0.032). It also reduced substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area responses to novelty. Preliminary cross-sectional evidence additionally suggested an association between long-term stimulant treatment and a reduction in the rewarding value of novelty. These data suggest that aberrant substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area novelty processing plays an important role in the suboptimal reward-related decision-making characteristic of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Compared to effects in controls, abnormalities in novelty processing and reward-related learning were improved by stimulant medication, suggesting that they may be disorder-specific targets for the pharmacological management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms.",0
"BACKGROUND: Following a natural disaster, survivors are vulnerable to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/ or depression. OBJECTIVES: (i) To screen survivors of the Bihar floods a month after the event to determine their scores in a screening questionnaire for PTSD and/ or depression and (ii) to correlate these scores with age and gender. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One thousand two hundred eighty-nine persons (645 females) who had been directly exposed to the floods in Bihar, India, in August 2008 were  assessed. The Screening Questionnaire for Disaster Mental Health (SQD) was used to screen for PTSD and depression. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Separate two-factor ANOVAs were used to compare persons of  both sexes and 5 different age groups for PTSD and depression scores. This was followed by post-hoc analysis for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: People over the age of 60 years had significantly higher scores for PTSD and depression compared to all groups (P< 0.05 for all comparisons). CONCLUSION: Following a natural disaster, older people appear more vulnerable to  develop PTSD and depression. This should be taken into account in devising strategies for disaster relief.",0
"Transparent Cylinder and Barrier tasks are used to purportedly assess inhibitory  control in a variety of animals. However, we suspect that performances on these detour tasks are influenced by non-cognitive traits, which may result in inaccurate assays of inhibitory control. We therefore reared pheasants under standardized conditions and presented each bird with two sets of similar tasks commonly used to measure inhibitory control. We recorded the number of times subjects incorrectly attempted to access a reward through transparent barriers, and their latencies to solve each task. Such measures are commonly used to infer  the differential expression of inhibitory control. We found little evidence that  their performances were consistent across the two different Putative Inhibitory Control Tasks (PICTs). Improvements in performance across trials showed that pheasants learned the affordances of each specific task. Critically, prior experience of transparent tasks, either Barrier or Cylinder, also improved subsequent inhibitory control performance on a novel task, suggesting that they also learned the general properties of transparent obstacles. Individual measures of persistence, assayed in a third task, were positively related to their frequency of incorrect attempts to solve the transparent inhibitory control tasks. Neophobia, Sex and Body Condition had no influence on individual performance. Contrary to previous studies of primates, pheasants with poor performance on PICTs had a wider dietary breadth assayed using a free-choice task. Our results demonstrate that in systems or taxa where prior experience and  differences in development cannot be accounted for, individual differences in performance on commonly used detour-dependent PICTS may reveal more about an individual's prior experience of transparent objects, or their motivation to acquire food, than providing a reliable measure of their inhibitory control.",0
"OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the rhythm of running-wheel activity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mice and the expression of Per 1 and Per 2 (circadian rhythm genes) in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), so as to investigate its mechanism underlying regulating circadian rhythm. METHODS: A total of 108 male C 57 BL / 6 J mice were randomly divided into control, HCC model and EA groups which were further assigned to six zeitbeger (environmental light-dark cycle) time (ZT) point (ZT 0, ZT 4, ZT 8, ZT 12, ZT 16 and ZT 20) subgroups. The HCC model was established by injection of H 22 cancer cell (abdominal 3(rd) generation, 10 microL) suspension into the larger live lobe. Mice of the control group received saline injection of the liver lobe. EA (2 Hz/15 Hz, 0.2 mA) was applied to bilateral ""Ganshu"" (BL 18) and ""Zhiyang"" (GV 9) for 15 min, once daily for 10 days. Mice of the control and model groups received the same binding-fixing to those of the EA group. Circadian running-wheel activity of 12 hratio12 h light darkness (LD) cycle (activity onset and acrophase of actogram, amplitude or peak of periodogram) was recorded by using ClockLab (ACT-500) software and analyzed by MATLAB (R 2007 b) before and after EA treatment. The pathological changes of liver cells were observed under light microscope after sectioning and HE. staining. The expression levels of Per 1 mRNA and Per 2 mRNA in the liver tissues were determined by fluorogenic quantitative real time-PCR. RESULTS: (1) Following modeling, the amplitude of periodogram of running-wheel activity was significantly lowered at ZT 0, ZT 4, ZT 8, ZT 12, ZT 16, and ZT 20 relevant to the control group (P<0.05). After EA intervention, the amplitude of periodogram at ZT 8 (1500) was considerably increased relevant to the model group (P<0.05), and the acrophase at ZT 8 was remarkably advanced (P<0.05). No significant changes were found in the onset time and periods of periodogram at the 6 time-points after modeling and EA intervention (P>0.05). (2) The expression levels of Per 1 mRNA and Per 2 mRNA in the SCN were significantly up-regulated at the 6 time-points in the model group relevant to the control group (P<0.05), and obviously down-regulated at ZT 8 after EA intervention relevant to the model group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: EA can benignly regulate the rhythm of running-wheel activity of HCC mice, which may be closely related to its effect in down-regulating the expression of circadian rhythm genes Per 1 and Per 2 in the SCN.",1
"AIM: To examine the differences in subjective well-being among people with different household income. METHOD: Data were obtained from the national survey conducted in June 2005, in which a representative sample of 896 participants were administered a questionnaire on several measures of subjective well-being as follows: happiness, life satisfaction, and satisfaction with different life domains (personal and national well-being index). One-way ANOVA was performed to test the differences in subjective well-being measures between participants grouped into six categories according to their monthly income. RESULTS: Happiness and life satisfaction ratings, as well as ratings of satisfaction with several life domains differed significantly between groups of people with different monthly income. Respondents with higher income felt happier (P<0.001), more satisfied with their life as a whole (P<0.001), more satisfied with their material status (P<0.001), health (P<0.001), achievement (P<0.001), future security (P=0.001), economic situation (P=0.001), state of the environment (P=0.003), and social conditions in Croatia (P=0.003). However, no significant differences were found between the two groups with the lowest income (0-70 euros  and 71-130 euro per person per month), nor between the two groups with the highest income (401-530 euros and 531+ euros per person per month). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that income and material wealth had an influence on  subjective well-being in contemporary Croatian society, which is undergoing major social and economical changes.",0
"From early infancy, humans reason about the external world in terms of identifiable, solid, cohesive objects persisting in space and time. This is one of the most fundamental human skills, which may be part of our innate conception  of object properties. Although object permanence has been extensively studied across a variety of taxa, little is known about how non-human animals reason about other object properties. In this study, we therefore tested how domestic horses (Equus ferus caballus) intuitively reason about object properties like solidity and height, to locate hidden food. Horses were allowed to look for a food reward behind two opaque screens, only one of which had either the proper height or inclination to hide food rewards. Our results suggest that horses could not intuitively reason about physical object properties, but rather learned to select the screen with the proper height or inclination from the second set of 5  trials.",0
"Effective filtering of distractor information has been shown to be dependent on perceptual load. Given the salience of emotional information and the presence of  emotion-attention interactions, we wanted to explore the recognition memory for emotional distractors especially as a function of focused attention and distributed attention by manipulating load and the spatial spread of attention. We performed two experiments to study emotion-attention interactions by measuring recognition memory performance for distractor neutral and emotional faces. Participants performed a color discrimination task (low-load) or letter identification task (high-load) with a letter string display in Experiment 1 and  a high-load letter identification task with letters presented in a circular array in Experiment 2. The stimuli were presented against a distractor face background. The recognition memory results show that happy faces were recognized better than  sad faces under conditions of less focused or distributed attention. When attention is more spatially focused, sad faces were recognized better than happy  faces. The study provides evidence for emotion-attention interactions in which specific emotional information like sad or happy is associated with focused or distributed attention respectively. Distractor processing with emotional information also has implications for theories of attention.",0
"OBJECTIVE OF ANALYSIS: The objective of this analysis is to examine the safety and effectiveness of percutaneous vertebroplasty for treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) compared with conservative treatment.CLINICAL NEED AND TARGET POPULATION: Osteoporosis and associated fractures are important health issues in ageing populations. Vertebral compression fracture secondary to osteoporosis is a cause of morbidity in older adults. VCFs can affect both genders, but are more common among elderly females and can occur as a result of a fall or a minor trauma. The fracture may occur spontaneously during a simple activity such as picking up an object or rising up  from a chair. Pain originating from the fracture site frequently increases with weight bearing. It is most severe during the first few weeks and decreases with rest and inactivity. Traditional treatment of painful VCFs includes bed rest, analgesic use, back bracing and muscle relaxants. The comorbidities associated with VCFs include deep venous thrombosis, acceleration of osteopenea, loss of height, respiratory problems and emotional problems due to chronic pain. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that has gained popularity as a new treatment option in the care for these patients. The technique of vertebroplasty was initially developed in France to treat osteolytic metastasis, myeloma, and hemangioma. The indications were further expanded to painful osteoporotic VCFs and subsequently to treatment of asymptomatic VCFs. The mechanism of pain relief, which occurs within minutes to hours after vertebroplasty, is still not known. Pain pathways in the surrounding tissue appear to be altered in response to mechanical, chemical, vascular, and thermal stimuli after the injection of the cement. It has been suggested that mechanisms  other than mechanical stabilization of the fracture, such as thermal injury to the nerve endings, results in immediate pain relief. PERCUTANEOUS VERTEBROPLASTY: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is performed with the patient in prone position and under local or general anesthesia. The procedure involves fluoroscopic imaging to guide the injection of bone cement into the fractured vertebral body to support the fractured bone. After injection of the cement, the patient is placed in supine position for about 1 hour while the cement hardens. Cement leakage is the most frequent complication of vertebroplasty. The leakages may remain asymptomatic or cause symptoms of nerve irritation through compression of nerve roots. There are several reports of pulmonary cement embolism (PCE) following vertebroplasty. In some cases, the PCE  may remain asymptomatic. Symptomatic PCE can be recognized by their clinical signs and symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, cyanosis, coughing, hemoptysis, dizziness, and sweating. RESEARCH METHODS: LITERATURE SEARCH: A literature search was performed on Feb 9, 2010 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published from January 1, 2005 to February 9, 2010. Studies were initially reviewed by titles and abstracts. For those studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained and reviewed. Reference lists were also examined for any additional relevant studies not identified through the search. Articles with an unknown eligibility were reviewed with a second clinical epidemiologist and then a group of epidemiologists until consensus was established. Data extraction was carried out by the author. INCLUSION CRITERIA: STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing vertebroplasty with a control group or other interventions STUDY POPULATION: Adult patients with osteoporotic vertebral fracturesSTUDY SAMPLE SIZE: Studies included 20 or more patientsEnglish language full-reportsPublished between Jan 1 2005 and Feb 9, 2010(eligible studies identified through the Auto Alert function of the search were also included) EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Non-randomized studiesStudies on conditions other than VCF (e.g. patients with multiple myeloma or metastatic tumors)Studies focused on surgical techniquesStudies lacking outcome measures RESULTS OF EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS: A systematic search yielded 168 citations. The titles and the abstracts of the citations were reviewed and full text of the identified citations was retrieved for further consideration. Upon review of the full publications and applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 5 RCTs were identified. Of these,  two compared vertebroplasty with sham procedure, two compared vertebroplasty with conservative treatment, and one compared vertebroplasty with balloon kyphoplasty. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS: Recently, the results of two blinded randomized placebo-controlled trials of percutaneous vertebroplasty were reported. These trials, providing the highest quality of evidence available to date, do not support the use of vertebroplasty in patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Based on the results of these trials, vertebroplasty offer no additional benefit over usual care and is not risk free. In these trials the treatment allocation was blinded to the patients and outcome assessors. The control group received a sham procedure simulating vertebroplasty to minimize the effect of expectations and to reduce the potential for bias in self-reporting of  outcomes. Both trials applied stringent exclusion criteria so that the results are generalizable to the patient populations that are candidates for vertebroplasty. In both trials vertebroplasty procedures were performed by highly skilled interventionists. Multiple valid outcome measures including pain, physical, mental, and social function were employed to test the between group differences in outcomes. Prior to these two trials, there were two open randomized trials in which vertebroplasty was compared with conservative medical  treatment. In the first randomized trial, patients were allowed to cross over to  the other arm and had to be stopped after two weeks due to the high numbers of patients crossing over. The other study did not allow cross over and recently published the results of 12 months follow-up. The following is the summary of the results of these 4 trials: Two blinded RCTs on vertebroplasty provide the highest level of evidence available to date. Results of these two trials are supported by findings of an open randomized trial with 12 months follow-up. Blinded RCTs showed: No significant differences in pain scores of patients who received vertebroplasty and patients who received a sham procedure as measured at 3 days,  2 weeks and 1 month in one study and at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months in the other.The observed differences in pain scores between the two groups were  neither statistically significant nor clinically important at any time points.The above findings were consistent with the findings of an open RCT in which patients were followed for 12 months. This study showed that improvement in pain was similar between the two groups at 3 months and were sustained to 12 months.In the blinded RCTs, physical, mental, and social functioning were measured at the above time points using 4-5 of the following 7 instruments: RDQ, EQ-5D, SF-36 PCS, SF-36 MCS, AQoL, QUALEFFO, SOF-ADLThere were no significant differences in any of these measures between patients who received vertebroplasty and patients who received a sham procedure at any of the above time points (with a few exceptions  in favour of control intervention).These findings were also consistent with the findings of an open RCT which demonstrated no significant between group differences in scores of ED-5Q, SF-36 PCS, SF 36 MCS, DPQ, Barthel, and MMSE which measure physical, mental, and social functioning (with a few exceptions in  favour of control intervention).One small (n=34) open RCT with a two week follow-up detected a significantly higher improvement in pain scores at 1 day after the intervention in vertebroplasty group compared with conservative treatment group. However, at 2 weeks follow-up, this difference was smaller and was not statistically significant.Conservative treatment was associated with fewer clinically important complicationsRisk of new VCFs following vertebroplasty was higher than those in conservative treatment but it requires further investigation.",0
"Japan has one of the world's highest rates of psychiatric institutionalization, and popular images of mental health care and public attitudes toward mental illness there have been stigmatized for decades. However, there are transitions underway that are reshaping the mental health care landscape as well as affecting public representations of mental illness. Those transitions include attempts to promote community-based care, move away from long-term hospitalization, reduce stigma, increase utilization of services, and bring clinical psychological services under the national health insurance umbrella. This article discusses one cultural representation in which those transitions are brought into relief: a 2002 television series entitled PsychoDoctor that portrayed the clinical practice of a psychiatrist. The article analyzes the messages inherent in the series about the nature of mental illness, the everyday-ness of sufferers, and the expanded repertoire of treatments now available. In so doing, the article suggests that the efforts of progressive clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, and mental health activists to put forth new images of mental illness and mental health care are now having a degree of success in the arena of popular culture.",0
"Flower visiting Eristalis hoverflies feed on nectar and pollen and are known to rely on innate colour preferences. In addition to a preference for visiting yellow flowers, the flies possess an innate proboscis reflex elicited by chemical as well as yellow colour stimuli. In this study we show that the flies' proboscis reflex is only triggered by yellow colour stimuli and not altered by conditioning to other colours. Neither in absolute nor in differential conditioning experiments the flies learned to associate other colours than yellow with reward. Even flies that experienced only blue nutrients during the first four days after  hatching could not be trained to extend the proboscis towards other colours than  yellow. The natural targets of the visually elicited proboscis reflex are yellow  pollen and yellow anthers. One consequence of our findings is that flowers might  advertise nectar and pollen rewards for Eristalis hoverflies by a yellow colour hue of nectar guides, nectaries, stamens or pollen. Alternatively, flowers might  protect their pollen against Eristalis by displaying other pollen colours than yellow or direct flies by yellow pollen-mimicking floral guides towards nectar resources. Testing the proboscis extension of various hoverfly species in the field showed that only Eristalis hoverflies possess the proboscis reflex elicited by yellow colour hues.",0
"Cognitively intact anxious elderly subjects were randomly assigned to either a progressive muscle relaxation-training condition or control condition (ns = 15) and then completed selected subtests from the Wechsler Memory Scale--Revised. Despite significant reductions in state anxiety in the relaxation group, no significant differences were detected between the two groups on memory measures.  These results are discussed within the context of previous research, and suggestions for further research are made.",0
"Female sexual wellbeing is complex and it's an important part of a comprehensive  approach to women's health. Unfortunately, this aspect of health often is not discussed during medical appointments which can be isolating for female patients. Low libido is the most common female sexual dysfunction. There are multiple causes of low libido that may be physical, cultural, emotional, medical psychological or due to her relationship with her partner. A healthy lifestyle is one way to help women overcome low libido and a few examples include exercise, mindfulness and yoga. Ultimately, these lifestyle approaches can enhance sexual satisfaction.",0
"Endogenous circadian clocks control 24-h physiological and behavioral rhythms in mammals. Here, we report a real-time in vivo fluorescence recording system that enables long-term monitoring of circadian rhythms in the brains of freely moving mice. With a designed reporter of circadian clock gene expression, we tracked robust Cry1 transcription reporter rhythms in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of WT, Cry1(-/-) , and Cry2(-/-) mice in LD (12 h light, 12 h dark) and DD (constant darkness) conditions and verified that signals remained stable for over 6 mo. Further, we recorded Cry1 transcriptional rhythms in the subparaventricular zone (SPZ) and hippocampal CA1/2 regions of WT mice housed under LD and DD conditions. By using a Cre-loxP system, we recorded Per2 and Cry1 transcription rhythms specifically in vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons of the SCN. Finally, we demonstrated the dynamics of Per2 and Cry1 transcriptional rhythms in SCN VIP neurons following an 8-h phase advance in the light/dark cycle.",1
"Synaptic connections between neurons in the brain are dynamic because of continuously ongoing spine dynamics, axonal sprouting, and other processes. In fact, it was recently shown that the spontaneous synapse-autonomous component of  spine dynamics is at least as large as the component that depends on the history  of pre- and postsynaptic neural activity. These data are inconsistent with common models for network plasticity and raise the following questions: how can neural circuits maintain a stable computational function in spite of these continuously  ongoing processes, and what could be functional uses of these ongoing processes?  Here, we present a rigorous theoretical framework for these seemingly stochastic  spine dynamics and rewiring processes in the context of reward-based learning tasks. We show that spontaneous synapse-autonomous processes, in combination with reward signals such as dopamine, can explain the capability of networks of neurons in the brain to configure themselves for specific computational tasks, and to compensate automatically for later changes in the network or task. Furthermore, we show theoretically and through computer simulations that stable computational performance is compatible with continuously ongoing synapse-autonomous changes. After reaching good computational performance it causes primarily a slow drift of network architecture and dynamics in task-irrelevant dimensions, as observed for neural activity in motor cortex and other areas. On the more abstract level of reinforcement learning the resulting model gives rise to an understanding of reward-driven network plasticity as continuous sampling of network configurations.",0
"Introduction Adolescence is a time of social and self-affirmation, search of autonomy and pleasure. An early sexual debut and substance use are still public health problems. Objectives To assess the prevalence of illicit drug use and sexual behavior of adolescents, ages 15- 17, followed in a Portuguese Family Health Unit. Material and methods This was a cross sectional descriptive study of a random convenience sample. Data were obtained from an anonymous and confidential questionnaire, given to patients at adolescent consultation, between the months of May and July 2016. Statistical significance p < 0.05. Results This  study involved a sample of 134 adolescents, 54.5% girls. It was revealed that 73.1% of adolescents have tried alcohol, from which 18.7% experienced intoxication at least once. Regarding tobacco, 35.1% have tried it, 23.4% are regular users. Regarding cannabinoids, 7.5% of adolescents stated to have tried them once, or to consume them regularly. Adolescents start to experiment with tobacco earlier than with alcohol (9 years old vs. 11 years old), with a mean age of 15 years old. Regarding sexual behavior, 23.8% are sexually active, from which 9.4% do not use any form of contraception. Smoking behavior was a predictor of the consumption of illicit drugs, and it was found a significantly statistic association between sexual activity and substance use, p = 0.04. Discussion By descending order, the alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs consumption are still worrisome and can affect the life of adolescents. Primarily health care and pediatric consultation should provide strategies for prevention and promotion of  a healthy lifestyle for adolescents.",0
"Disasters can strike uncontrollably whenever or wherever, leaving horrendous marks of physical and psychological damage on people upon their passing. Asia remains the most widely affected area of the world, with high death tolls, casualties, and economic losses recorded in past years. In fact, a developed country like South Korea incurs huge deficits from disaster-related adversities.  Restoration efforts and assistance for disaster survivors are generously provided by the Korean government. However, it is only recently that cases of postdisaster mental problems have been given attention. This article argues that, although material relief helps disaster victims to regain their physical losses, it is equally important to aid their psychological needs to prevent long-term mental health problems. This article highlights Korea's first regional Psychological Support Center for disaster victims, which can be accessed online. With this Center, the country continues to strive in providing her people with holistic approaches to further enhance each citizen's quality of life.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Although research often relies on retrospective affect self-reports, little is known about personality's role in retrospective reports and how these converge or deviate from affect reported in the moment. This micro-longitudinal study examines personality (Neuroticism, Extraversion) and emotional salience (peak and recent affect) associations with retrospective-momentary affect report discrepancies over different time frames. METHOD: Participants were 179 adults aged 20-78 (M = 48.7 years; 73.7% Caucasian/White) who each provided up to 60 concurrent affect reports over 10 days, then retrospectively reported overall intensity of each affective state after 1 day and again after 1-2 months. RESULTS: Multilevel models revealed that individuals retrospectively overreported or underreported various affective states, exhibiting peak associations for high arousal positive and negative affect, recency associations for low arousal positive affect, and distinct personality profiles that strengthened over time. Individuals high in both Extraversion and Neuroticism exaggerated high arousal positive and negative affect and underreported low arousal positive affect, high Extraversion/low Neuroticism individuals exaggerated high arousal positive affect and underreported low arousal positive affect, and low Extraversion/high Neuroticism individuals exaggerated high and low arousal negative affect. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to identify arousal-specific retrospective affect report discrepancies over time and suggests retrospective reports also reflect personality differences in affective self-knowledge.",1
"The Self-Regulatory Executive Function model [S-REF; Wells, A., & Matthews, G. (1996). Modelling cognition in emotional disorder: the S-REF model. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 34, 881-888] proposes that metacognitive beliefs, inflexible self-focused attention, and perseverative thinking (rumination and worry) play an important role in maintaining emotional dysfunction. Attention training [ATT; Wells, A. (1990). Panic disorder in association with relaxation induced anxiety: an attentional training approach to treatment. Behavior Therapy, 21, 273-280] is a technique designed to increase attentional control and flexibility, and thereby lessen the impact of these maintaining factors. The main aim of this study was to determine whether or not supplementing cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT) with ATT could potentiate greater changes in social anxiety, depression, attentional control, metacognitive beliefs, and anticipatory and post-event processing in a clinical sample with social phobia. Patients (N=81) were allocated to CBGT with ATT or relaxation training (RT). ATT  did not potentiate greater change on any outcome variable, with both groups achieving significant improvements on all measures. Exploratory correlational analyses (pre-treatment and changes scores) showed that some metacognitive beliefs were associated with attentional control, anticipatory processing, and symptoms of social anxiety and depression. However, attentional control was more  consistently associated with anticipatory processing, post-event processing, and  symptoms of social anxiety and depression, than with metacognitive beliefs. Results are discussed with reference to cognitive behavioral models of social phobia. It is tentatively concluded that while supplementing CBGT with ATT does not improve outcomes, increasing attentional control during CBGT is associated with symptom relief.",0
"Exposure to psychosocial stressors increases consumption of palatable, calorically dense diets (CDD) and the risk for obesity, especially in females. While consumption of an obesogenic diet and chronic stress have both been shown to decrease dopamine 2 receptor (D2R) binding and alter functional connectivity (FC) within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), it remains uncertain how social experience and dietary environment interact to affect reward pathways critical for the regulation of motivated behavior. Using positron emission tomography (PET) and resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance neuroimaging (rs-fMRI), in female rhesus monkeys maintained in a low calorie chow (n = 18) or a dietary choice condition (chow and a CDD; n = 16) for 12 months, the current study tested the overarching hypothesis that the adverse social experience resulting from subordinate social status would interact with consumption of an obesogenic diet to increase caloric intake that would be predicted by greater cortisol, lower prefrontal D2R binding potential (D2R-BP) and lower PFC-NAcc FC. Results showed that the consequences of adverse social experience imposed by chronic social subordination vary significantly depending on the dietary environment and are associated with alterations in prefrontal D2R-BP and FC in NAcc-PFC sub-regions that predict differences in caloric intake, body weight gain, and fat accumulation. Higher levels of cortisol in the chow-only condition were associated with mild inappetence, as well as increased orbitofrontal (OFC) D2R-BP and greater FC between the NAcc and the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) and ventromedial PFC (vmPFC). However, increased cortisol release in females in the dietary choice condition was associated with reduced prefrontal D2R-BP, and opposite FC between the NAcc and the vmPFC and dlPFC observed in the chow-only females. Importantly, the degree of these glucocorticoid-related neuroadaptations predicted significantly more total calorie intake as well as more consumption of the CDD for females having a dietary choice, but had no relation to calorie intake in the chow-only condition. Overall, the current findings suggest that dietary environment modifies the consequences of adverse social experience on reward pathways and appetite regulation and, in an obesogenic dietary environment, may reflect impaired cognitive control of food intake.",0
"BACKGROUND: The aim of the current paper is to provide the first comparison of computational mechanisms and neurofunctional substrates in adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) during decision making under ambiguity. METHODS: Sixteen boys with ADHD, 20 boys with OCD, and 20 matched control subjects (12-18 years of age) completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging version of the Iowa Gambling Task. Brain activation was compared between groups using three-way analysis of covariance. Hierarchical Bayesian analysis was used to compare computational modeling parameters between groups. RESULTS: Patient groups shared reduced choice consistency and relied less on reinforcement learning during decision making relative to control subjects, while adolescents with ADHD alone demonstrated increased reward sensitivity. During advantageous choices, both disorders shared underactivation in ventral striatum,  while OCD patients showed disorder-specific underactivation in the ventromedial orbitofrontal cortex. During outcome evaluation, shared underactivation to losses in patients relative to control subjects was found in the medial prefrontal cortex and shared underactivation to wins was found in the left putamen/caudate.  ADHD boys showed disorder-specific dysfunction in the right putamen/caudate, which was activated more to losses in patients with ADHD but more to wins in control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest shared deficits in using learned reward expectancies to guide decision making, as well as shared dysfunction in medio-fronto-striato-limbic brain regions. However, findings of unique dysfunction in the ventromedial orbitofrontal cortex in OCD and in the right putamen in ADHD indicate additional, disorder-specific abnormalities and extend similar findings from inhibitory control tasks in the disorders to the domain of  decision making under ambiguity.",0
"Romantic relationships, although increasingly normative during adolescence, also present unique developmental challenges that can portend psychological difficulties. Underlying these difficulties may be the degree to which daily romantic transactions potentiate fluctuations in negative mood. The present study examined associations between adolescents' daily romantic relationship experiences and their same-day negative affective states (i.e., fluctuations in high-arousal, aversive mood). Using a dyadic ecological momentary assessment (EMA) design, this study followed an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample of 98 adolescent romantic couples twice weekly for 12 weeks (n = 196 individuals; Mage = 16.74 years, SD = 0.90; 45% Latina/o, 45% White; 55% receiving free or reduced meals). The results indicated that various daily romantic experiences (e.g., conflict, feelings about the relationship) predicted greater same-day negative affect. Beyond the effects of these romantic experiences, adolescent couples were also synchronized in their fluctuating negative affective states, evidencing the presence of emotional contagion. Overall, the findings indicate the salience of romantic relationships in the everyday lives of adolescents.",1
"Spontaneous sighing is related to subjective relief of negative emotional states. Whether this also applies to instructed sighing is not known. The present study aimed to investigate sEMG and respiratory variability (1) during recovery from mental stress with and without an instructed sigh; (2) before and after spontaneous sighs throughout the experiment. A spontaneous sigh was preceded by increasing sEMG and increasing random respiratory variability, and followed by decreasing sEMG and increased structured correlated respiratory variability. Following an instructed sigh, a smaller reduction in sEMG and an increase in random respiratory variability during recovery from mental stress were observed.  Thus, a spontaneous sigh seemed to induce relief. An instructed sigh appeared to  inhibit recovery from mental stress.",0
"Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a common vertebrate animal model in biomedical research and is a promising species for studying how genes interact with environmental factors in determining behavior. The present study investigated how reinforcement parameters affect zebrafish behavior by assessing response acquisition with delayed reinforcement, which has been studied with other species (e.g., rats, pigeons, humans, etc.) but not with zebrafish. Twenty-four experimentally naïve subjects were exposed to a tandem fixed-ratio 1 differential-reinforcement-of-other-behavior x-s schedule of reinforcement, where x varied across subjects. There were six different delay-to-reinforcement durations and sets of four fish were assigned to each delay duration. All of the  fish assigned to a 0-, 0.5-, or 1-s delay acquired responding. Two fish acquired  responding with a 3-s delay and one fish appeared to have acquired it with a 6-s  delay although the latter result was less clear. None acquired responding with a  12-s delay. These results suggest that zebrafish behavior is sensitive to delays  to reinforcement and the time frame over which reinforcement is effective may be  limited approximately to 6 s. This time frame is shorter than that found with other species. Practical and theoretical implications of the present finding are  discussed.",0
"It has been suggested that high arousal negative affective states, but not low arousal negative affective states, potentiate the startle response. Because sadness has generally been studied as a low arousal emotion, it remains unclear whether high arousal sadness would produce startle potentiation to a similar degree as high arousal fear. To address this issue, 32 participants viewed two sets of 10-min film clips selected to induce two affective states of high subjective arousal (fear, sadness) and a neutral state of low subjective arousal, while the eyeblink startle response associated with brief noise bursts was assessed using orbicularis oculi EMG. Larger blink magnitude was found for fearful than for sad or neutral clips. Implications for conceptualizing sadness are discussed.",1
"BACKGROUND: Research suggests that interaction between humans and digital environments characterizes a form of companionship in addition to technical convenience. To this effect, humans have attempted to design computer systems able to demonstrably empathize with the human affective experience. Facial electromyography (EMG) is one such technique enabling machines to access to human affective states. Numerous studies have investigated the effects of valence emotions on facial EMG activity captured over the corrugator supercilii (frowning muscle) and zygomaticus major (smiling muscle). The arousal emotion, specifically, has not received much research attention, however. In the present study, we sought to identify intensive valence and arousal affective states via facial EMG activity. METHODS: Ten blocks of affective pictures were separated into five categories: neutral valence/low arousal (0VLA), positive valence/high arousal (PVHA), negative valence/high arousal (NVHA), positive valence/low arousal (PVLA), and negative valence/low arousal (NVLA), and the ability of each to elicit corresponding valence and arousal affective states was investigated at length. One hundred and thirteen participants were subjected to these stimuli and provided facial EMG. A set of 16 features based on the amplitude, frequency, predictability, and variability of signals was defined and classified using a support vector machine (SVM). RESULTS: We observed highly accurate classification rates based on the combined corrugator and zygomaticus EMG, ranging from 75.69% to 100.00% for the baseline and five affective states (0VLA, PVHA, PVLA, NVHA, and NVLA) in all individuals. There were significant differences in classification rate accuracy between senior and young adults, but there was no significant difference between female and male participants. CONCLUSION: Our research provides robust evidences for recognition of intensive valence and arousal affective states in young and senior adults. These findings contribute to the successful future application of facial EMG for identifying user affective states in human machine interaction (HMI) or companion robotic systems (CRS).",1
"The processing of rewards and losses are crucial to everyday functioning. Considerable interest has been attached to investigating the anticipation and outcome phases of reward and loss processing, but results to date have been inconsistent. It is unclear if anticipation and outcome of a reward or loss recruit similar or distinct brain regions. In particular, while the striatum has  widely been found to be active when anticipating a reward, whether it activates in response to the anticipation of losses as well remains ambiguous. Furthermore, concerning the orbitofrontal/ventromedial prefrontal regions, activation is often observed during reward receipt. However, it is unclear if this area is active during reward anticipation as well. We ran an Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analysis of 50 fMRI studies, which used the Monetary Incentive Delay Task (MIDT), to identify which brain regions are implicated in the anticipation of rewards, anticipation of losses, and the receipt of reward. Anticipating rewards  and losses recruits overlapping areas including the striatum, insula, amygdala and thalamus, suggesting that a generalised neural system initiates motivational  processes independent of valence. The orbitofrontal/ventromedial prefrontal regions were recruited only during the reward outcome, likely representing the value of the reward received. Our findings help to clarify the neural substrates  of the different phases of reward and loss processing, and advance neurobiological models of these processes.",0
"Finding creative solutions to difficult problems is a fundamental aspect of human culture and a skill highly needed. However, the exact neural processes underlying creative problem solving remain unclear. Insightful problem solving tasks were shown to be a valid method for investigating one subcomponent of creativity: the  Aha!-moment. Finding insightful solutions during a remote associates task (RAT) was found to elicit specific cortical activity changes. Considering the strong affective components of Aha!-moments, as manifested in the subjectively experienced feeling of relief following the sudden emergence of the solution of the problem without any conscious forewarning, we hypothesized the subcortical dopaminergic reward network to be critically engaged during Aha. To investigate those subcortical contributions to insight, we employed ultra-high-field 7 T fMRI during a German Version of the RAT. During this task, subjects were exposed to word triplets and instructed to find a solution word being associated with all the three given words. They were supposed to press a button as soon as they felt  confident about their solution without further revision, allowing us to capture the exact event of Aha!-moment. Besides the finding on cortical involvement of the left anterior middle temporal gyrus (aMTG), here we showed for the first time robust subcortical activity changes related to insightful problem solving in the  bilateral thalamus, hippocampus, and the dopaminergic midbrain comprising ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and caudate nucleus. These results shed new light on the affective neural mechanisms underlying insightful problem solving.",0
"Time-sampling methodology was implemented to examine the prospective associations between affect, desire to gamble, and gambling behavior in individuals diagnosed with a mood disorder. Thirty (9 male, 21 female) adults with a lifetime diagnosis of a depressive or bipolar disorder diagnosis who endorsed current gambling and lifetime gambling harm participated in the present study. Participants completed electronic diary entries of their current affective state, desire to gamble, and gambling behavior for 30 consecutive days. Hierarchical linear modelling revealed that affect was not a predictor of gambling behavior. Instead, affect predicted the desire to gamble, with high levels of sadness and arousal independently predicting an increased desire to gamble. Desire to gamble predicted actual gambling behavior. There were no differences across diagnostic groups in terms of gambling motivations at baseline; however, during the 30-day period, participants with bipolar disorder endorsed gambling to cope with negative affect more often than did participants with depressive disorder, whereas those with depressive disorder more often endorsed gambling for social reasons or enhancement of positive affect. The present findings provide evidence that negative affect is not directly related to actual gambling behavior, and suggest that affective states rather impact the desire to gamble.",1
"Introduction: Most adolescent smokers report a desire to quit, and many have made several unsuccessful quit attempts; however, when adolescents attempt to quit, they often resume smoking quickly. This ecological study aimed to (1) characterize affective and situational precipitants of smoking lapses among adolescents, and (2) explore the moderating influence of nicotine dependence severity on lapse precipitants. Methods: Adolescent daily smokers (n=166; ages 14-18 years) completed electronic diaries of cigarettes smoked, craving and affective states, and situational variables on handheld computers in their natural environment for two weeks following an unassisted quit attempt. On average, adolescents were moderately nicotine dependent (Modified Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire [mFTQ] score=4.9; SD=1.6). Results: Craving was a significant episodic cue for lapse and stable influence on lapse, relating to 44% and 15% increased odds of lapse, respectively. High-arousal affective states-regardless of valence-were associated with 12-13% increased odds of lapse. Low-arousal positive affective states were associated with 17% decreased odds of lapse. A 1-unit difference in a teen's mFTQ score related to 27% increased odds of lapse, but dependence severity did not moderate proximal lapse influences. Conclusions: This report provides some of the first ecological data characterizing adolescent smoking lapses following a quit attempt. As in prior work with teens, lapses were nearly universal and quickly followed the quit attempt. Specific situational and affective contexts of smoking lapses for adolescents were implicated, indicating the need for cessation interventions to address craving and high-arousal affective states as precipitators of lapse in this high-risk group. Implications: This report provides some of the first ecological data characterizing smoking lapses among teens attempting to quit smoking on their own. Like adults, adolescents face many barriers when making quit attempts. The present work provides ecological data to suggest that the experience of heightened arousal in teens' daily lives interferes with their efforts to quit smoking. Thus, this work highlights the importance of affective dysregulation, or amplitude of emotional feelings, for teen smoking lapses. Moment-to-moment fluctuation in craving was also implicated as a dynamic precipitator of smoking lapse in this high-risk group.",1
"Despite the well-documented positive effect of exercise on health outcomes, most people do not succeed in exercising regularly. In addition to several other influences, affective states seem to support exercise participation. Associations between exercise and affect have been shown in the laboratory. However, the dynamic relation between affect and exercise in daily life is not yet well-understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the bi-directional effect of momentary affective states on naturally occurring exercise and vice versa in healthy participants in real-life environments by applying an ecological momentary assessment design. We hypothesized that (1) exercise duration is positively associated with affective states on a day level, (2) affective states in the morning predict subsequent exercise duration, and (3) exercise duration predicts affective states in the evening on that respective day. Data from N = 60 students aged between 19 and 32 years were analyzed. Affect and exercise duration were assessed daily over a period of 20 days via an electronic diary. Multilevel analysis revealed that positive affective valence was positively associated with exercise duration (p = 0.003) on a day level. In addition, the more the participants exercised that respective day, the better and more content they felt in the evening (p = 0.009). Energetic arousal in the morning significantly predicted subsequent exercise duration (p = 0.045). The findings indicate that it would be worthwhile to focus more on within-subject analyses when analyzing the dynamic relation between affect and exercise. Furthermore, affective states should be taken into account in creating effective interventions to foster exercise behavior and enhance maintenance.",1
"Previous findings suggest that visual working memory (VWM) preferentially remembers angry looking faces. However, the meaning of facial actions is construed in relation to context. To date, there are no studies investigating the role of perceiver-based context when processing emotional cues in VWM. To explore the influence of affective context on VWM for faces, we conducted two experiments using both a VWM task for emotionally expressive faces and a mood induction procedure. Affective context was manipulated by unpleasant (Experiment 1) and pleasant (Experiment 2) IAPS pictures in order to induce an affect high in motivational intensity (defensive or appetitive, respectively) compared to a low arousal control condition. Results indicated specifically increased sensitivity of VWM for angry looking faces in the neutral condition. Enhanced VWM for angry faces was prevented by inducing affects of high motivational intensity. In both experiments, affective states led to a switch from specific enhancement of angry expressions in VWM to an equally sensitive representation of all emotional expressions. Our findings demonstrate that emotional expressions are of different behavioral relevance for the receiver depending on the affective context, supporting a functional organization of VWM along with flexible resource allocation. In VWM, stimulus processing adjusts to situational requirements and transitions from a specifically prioritizing default mode in predictable environments to a sensitive, hypervigilant mode in exposure to emotional events.",1
"The present study examines the mental health management of pathological gamblers  by counseling and relaxation practices. Fifty-five treated and 55 non-treated pathological gamblers were evaluated at S. I. Mental and Physical Health Society, Varanasi, India. The two groups were matched by age, ranging 20 to 53 years with  a mean age of 36.2 years and mean length of uncontrollable gambling of 7.3 years. The Middlesex Hospital Questionnaire and the Death Anxiety Scale were administered to ascertain mental health and death anxiety on seven selected dimensions, including: anxiety, obsession, phobia, somatization, depression, hysteria, and death anxiety. Mean scores obtained on different variables were analyzed using a t-test of significance. Results indicated that the characteristic associated with treated pathological gamblers was phobia whereas the characteristics associated with non-treated pathological gamblers were anxiety, obsession, somatization, depression, and death anxiety.",0
"Evidence that structured physical activity can help to regulate affective state has spurred interest in identifying associations between unstructured physical activity and affective states during daily life. The present study examined whether stressful daily life situations that elicit affective arousal also elicit increased physical activity in the form of restless movement. The study compared the physical activity of professors (n = 25) after presenting a classroom lecture to their physical activity at the same time of day on a non-lecture workday. The expectation was that lecturing would increase affective arousal, leading to greater restless movement following the lecture compared to the non-lecture control day. The study assessed subjective arousal to confirm that arousal was higher during the lecture. The primary outcome measures were actigraphy-measured standing and stepping times and number of steps and posture transitions. Results indicate that energetic and tense arousal were higher during the lecture than during the control period. Mean (+/-SE) up time (standing and stepping) for the 1st minute of the 20 minute post-lecture period was double that of the last minute (32.8 +/- 5.73 s to 16.5 +/- 5.41 s), while it remained low throughout the comparison period on the control day (p = 0.01). Subjects also took more steps (p = 0.006) and engaged in more transitions between sitting and standing (p = 0.02) after the lecture than after the control period. These results support the conclusion that stressful daily life situations that elicit affective arousal also elicit increased physical activity in the form of restless movement and suggest that affective responses to stressful situations may be important determinants of physical activity during daily life.",1
"In this paper, time, frequency, and time-frequency features derived from thermal infrared data are used to discriminate between self-reported affective states of an individual in response to visual stimuli drawn from the International Affective Pictures System. A total of six binary classification tasks were examined to distinguish baseline and affect states. Affect states were determined from subject-reported levels of arousal and valence. Mean adjusted accuracies of 70% to 80% were achieved for the baseline classifications tasks. Classification accuracies between high and low ratings of arousal and valence were between 50% and 60%, respectively. Our analysis showed that facial thermal infrared imaging data of baseline and other affective states may be separable. The results of this study suggest that classification of facial thermal infrared imaging data coupled with affect models can be used to provide information about an individual's affective state for potential use as a passive communication pathway.",1
"OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are clinically effective for insomnia, but the research findings have been mixed. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examined the effect of MBIs on insomnia. METHOD: Both English (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases) and Chinese (WanFang and CNKI) databases were systematically and independently searched. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and risk ratio (RR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random effects model. RESULTS: Five RCTs (n = 520) comparing MBIs (n = 279) and control (n = 241) groups were identified and analyzed. Compared to the control group, participants  in the MBIs group showed significant improvement in insomnia as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (n = 247; SMD: -1.01, 95% CI: -1.28 to -0.75, I2 = 0%, p < 0.00001) at post-MBIs assessment. CONCLUSION: In this comprehensive meta-analysis, MBIs appear to be effective in the treatment of insomnia. Further studies to examine the long-term effects of MBIs for insomnia are needed.",0
"Background: Although people generally feel more positive and more energetic in the aftermath of exercise than before, longitudinal research on how exercise relates to within-person fluctuations in affect over the course of everyday life is still relatively limited. One constraint on doing such research is the need to provide participants with accelerometers to objectively record their exercise, and pagers to capture affective reports. Aims: We aimed to develop a methodology for studying affect and exercise using only technology that participants already possess, namely GPS running watches and smartphones. Using this methodology, we aimed to characterize within-individual fluctuations in affective valence and arousal in relation to bouts of exercise, and explore possible moderators of these fluctuations. Methods: We recruited a sample of 38 recreational runners. Participants provided daily affective reports for six weeks using their smartphones. Information on their runs was harvested from their own GPS devices via an online platform for athletes. Results: Average valence and arousal were higher on days when the person had run than on the next day, and higher the day after a run than on the days after that. Over the course of the day of a run, valence and arousal declined significantly as the time since the run increased. Physically fitter participants had more positive valence overall, and this was particularly true when they had not run recently. There was some evidence of higher-dose (i.e., longer and faster) runs being associated with lower arousal on the next and subsequent days. Gender did not moderate associations between running and valence or arousal. Discussion: Our study demonstrated the potential for studying the associations between affect and exercise in a way that is precise, undemanding for participants, and convenient for researchers, using technologies that participants already own and use.",1
"Defining the structural organization of emotions is a central unresolved question in affective science. In particular, the extent to which autonomic nervous system activity signifies distinct affective states remains controversial. Most prior research on this topic has used univariate statistical approaches in attempts to classify emotions from psychophysiological data. In the present study, electrodermal, cardiac, respiratory, and gastric activity, as well as self-report measures were taken from healthy subjects during the experience of fear, anger, sadness, surprise, contentment, and amusement in response to film and music clips. Information pertaining to affective states present in these response patterns was analyzed using multivariate pattern classification techniques. Overall accuracy for classifying distinct affective states was 58.0% for autonomic measures and 88.2% for self-report measures, both of which were significantly above chance. Further, examining the error distribution of classifiers revealed that the dimensions of valence and arousal selectively contributed to decoding emotional states from self-report, whereas a categorical configuration of affective space was evident in both self-report and autonomic measures. Taken together, these findings extend recent multivariate approaches to study emotion and indicate that pattern classification tools may improve upon univariate approaches to reveal the underlying structure of emotional experience and physiological expression.",1
"BACKGROUND: Employees remain at risk of developing physical and mental health problems. To improve the lifestyle, health, and productivity many workplace interventions have been developed. However, not all of these interventions are effective. Mobile and wireless technology to support health behavior change (mobile health [mHealth] apps) is a promising, but relatively new domain for the  occupational setting. Research on mHealth apps for the mental and physical health of employees is scarce. Interventions are more likely to be useful if they are rooted in health behavior change theory. Evaluating the presence of specific combinations of behavior change techniques (BCTs) in mHealth apps might be used as an indicator of potential quality and effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess whether mHealth apps for the mental and physical health of employees incorporate BCTs and, if so, which BCTs can be identified and which combinations of BCTs are present. METHODS: An assessment was made of apps aiming to reduce the risk of physical and psychosocial work demands and to promote a healthy lifestyle for employees. A systematic search was performed in iTunes and Google Play. Forty-five apps were screened and downloaded. BCTs were identified using a taxonomy applied in similar reviews. The mean and ranges were calculated. RESULTS: On average, the apps included 7 of the 26 BCTs (range 2-18). Techniques  such as ""provide feedback on performance,"" ""provide information about behavior-health link,"" and ""provide instruction"" were used most frequently. Techniques that were used least were ""relapse prevention,"" ""prompt self-talk,"" ""use follow-up prompts,"" and ""provide information about others' approval."" ""Stress management,"" ""prompt identification as a role model,"" and ""agree on behavioral contract"" were not used by any of the apps. The combination ""provide information about behavior-health link"" with ""prompt intention formation"" was found in 7/45 (16%) apps. The combination ""provide information about behavior-health link"" with ""provide information on consequences,"" and ""use follow-up prompts"" was found in 2 (4%) apps. These combinations indicated potential effectiveness. The least potentially effective combination ""provide feedback on performance"" without ""provide instruction"" was found in 13 (29%) apps. CONCLUSIONS: Apps for the occupational setting might be substantially improved to increase potential since results showed a limited presence of BCTs in general, limited use of potentially successful combinations of BCTs in apps, and use of potentially unsuccessful combinations of BCTs. Increasing knowledge on the effectiveness of BCTs in apps might be used to develop guidelines for app developers and selection criteria for companies and individuals. Also, this might contribute to decreasing the burden of work-related diseases. To achieve this, app developers, health behavior change professionals, experts on physical and mental health, and end-users should collaborate when developing apps for the working context.",0
"OBJECTIVES: This study examined the association between reward processing, as measured by performance on the probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) task and avoidance/rumination in depressed older adults treated with Engage, a psychotherapy that uses ""reward exposure"" to increase behavioral activation. METHODS: Thirty older adults with major depression received 9 weeks of Engage treatment. At baseline and treatment end, the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating  Scale (HAM-D) was used to assess depression severity and the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS) to assess behavioral activation and avoidance/rumination. Participants completed the PRL task at baseline and at treatment end. The PRL requires participants to learn stimulus-reward contingencies through trial and error, and switch strategies when the contingencies unexpectedly change. RESULTS: At the end of Engage treatment, the severity of depression was lower (HAM-D: t(19) = -7.67, P < .001) and behavioral activation was higher (BADS: t(19) = 2.23, P = .02) compared to baseline. Response time following all switches (r(19) = -0.63, P = .003) and error switches (r(19) = -0.57, P = .01) at baseline was negatively associated with the BADS avoidance/rumination subscale score at the end of Engage treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired reward learning, evidenced by slower response following all switches and error switches, contributes to avoidant, ruminative behavior at the  end of Engage therapy even when depression improves. Understanding reward processing abnormalities of avoidance and rumination may improve the timing and targeting of interventions for these symptoms, whose persistence compromises quality of life and increases the risk of depression relapse.",0
"Poor management of chronic diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes, particularly among the uninsured, places medical and financial burdens on the healthcare system. Clínica Esperanza/Hope Clinic initiated a chronic disease management program for uninsured residents of Rhode Island (RI) called Bridging the [Health Equity] Gap (BTG), which offers continuity of care, quarterly goal-setting appointments, and healthy lifestyle interventions. Outcomes for 549  participants from the initial evaluation period are presented here. Over the first 12 months of enrollment, mean hemoglobin A1c decreased from 10.2% to 8.3% (p<0.001), and mean blood glucose of individuals with diabetes decreased by 51 mg/dL (p<0.01). BTG participants used the local emergency department (ED) 60% less than Medicaid-insured RI residents and had 61% fewer ""potentially preventable"" ED visits. The positive impact of BTG on chronic disease outcomes and ED usage by uninsured patients suggests that programs like BTG may reduce overall healthcare costs in the state.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Lack of referral guidelines can cause delayed or even non-existent rehabilitation for chronic pain patients. Indicators signalling the need for interventions could counteract this delay for pain rehabilitation and thereby prevent deteriorating patient health. This study aimed to explore the indicators  of need for pain rehabilitation using a multidisciplinary expert panel working with pain rehabilitation. METHODS: A three-round Delphi study was conducted with a multidisciplinary expert panel (n = 23), each representing one pain rehabilitation unit in Sweden. The expert panel produced indicators, which were then ranked using a four-point Likert scale. RESULTS: Twenty multi-faceted indicators for pain rehabilitation were identified. A major part concerned patient problems with activity level, catastrophizing, coping, existential problems, fear avoidance, high pain rating, medication, mental health, motivation, no pain relief, pain spread/increase, psychosocial problems combined with activity problems, psychosocial problems, recovery, and reduced physical function. Furthermore, indicators concerned demographic factors, sick leave, situation in primary health care and work. Finally, tacit knowledge was pointed out as an indicator. The results support previous research but also bring out less quantifiable indicators, such as relying on tacit knowledge while  assessing a patient's need for rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: The indicators for pain rehabilitation were comprehensive, pointing out that needs assessment is complex. Despite reaching consensus on 19 out of 20  indicators, further research is needed to deepen knowledge in this area and to secure a fair assessment of a patient's need for pain rehabilitation.",0
"The protocol for the temptation resistance paradigm was designed to elicit 2- to  8-year-old children's strategic lie-telling behaviors. The reward of transgression was intended to be too tempting to resist, so that children's spontaneous lie-telling behavior in the presence of irreversible evidence due to  the transgression could be observed. Conducted in a developmental psychology laboratory behind a one-way mirror and video recorded with a hidden camcorder, the protocol starts with a guessing game where the child is given three trials to guess the identities of hidden objects under an upside down cup. The experimenter gives hints in the first two trials to make sure the child ""guess"" them correctly. At the beginning of the final trial, the experimenter leaves the room  briefly and asks the child not to peek under the cup. If the child could not resist the temptation and peeks, small particles previously filled in the cup would scatter on a grooved surface. Upon the experimenter's return, the child is  asked if he/she has peeked. If he/she denies transgression contrary to the presence of the physical evidence, he/she is asked to explain why the particles are on the table. Three responses could be observed in the procedure, including the initial transgression, truth-telling or lie-telling behavior if the child peeked, and the strategic lie-telling behavior in the presence of the physical evidence.",0
"There are surprisingly few discussions of the link between wellbeing and alcohol, and few empirical studies to underpin them. Policymakers have therefore typically considered negative wellbeing impacts while ignoring positive ones, used gross overestimates of positive impacts via a naïve 'consumer surplus' approach, or ignored wellbeing completely. We examine an alternative subjective wellbeing method for investigating alcohol and wellbeing, using fixed effects analyses of the associations between drinking and wellbeing within two different types of data. Study 1 examines wave-to-wave changes in life satisfaction and past-week alcohol consumption/alcohol problems (CAGE) from a representative cohort of people born in Britain in 1970, utilising responses at ages 30, 34 and 42 (a sample size of 29,145 observations from 10,107 individuals). Study 2 examines moment-to-moment changes in happiness and drinking from an iPhone-based data set  in Britain 2010-13, which is innovative and large (2,049,120 observations from 31,302 individuals) but unrepresentative. In Study 1 we find no significant relationship between changing drinking levels and changing life satisfaction (p = 0.20), but a negative association with developing drinking problems (-0.18 points on a 0-10 scale; p = 0.003). In contrast, Study 2 shows a strong and consistent moment-to-moment relationship between happiness and drinking events (+3.88 points on a 0-100 scale; p < 0.001), although associations beyond the moment in question are smaller and more inconsistent. In conclusion, while iPhone users are happier at the moment of drinking, there are only small overspills to other moments, and among the wider population, changing drinking levels across several years are not associated with changing life satisfaction. Furthermore, drinking problems are associated with lower life satisfaction. Simple accounts of the wellbeing impacts of alcohol policies are therefore likely to be misleading.  Policymakers must consider the complexity of different policy impacts on different conceptions of 'wellbeing', over different time periods, and among different types of drinkers.",0
"Qualls and Sheehan's finding of a disordinal Personality Trait X Treatment interaction underscores the indispensability of both disciplines of scientific psychology for the study of some important phenomena. It is noteworthy that such  interactions are entirely congruent with a reasonable conception of personality traits as dispositions, that is, as inherently interactive functional units. Using absorption, the trait studied by Qualls and Sheehan, as an example, it is shown how an empirically corroborated interactive trait concept can be used as a  source of ideas for further Trait X Treatment studies and even for pure experimentation. Specifically, a distinction is proposed between two hypothetical mental sets: an experiential (or respondent) set and an instrumental (or operant) set. High-absorption subjects differ from low-absorption subjects in that the former appear more experientially and less instrumentally disposed than the latter. This hypothetical difference, in conjunction with the assumption that relaxation can function respondently as well as operantly, can be used to account for Qualls and Sheehan's findings and suggests additional investigations as well.",0
"Although largely unrecognized by sleep scholars, sleeping is a pleasure. This report aims first, to fill the gap: sleep, like food, water and sex, is a primary reinforcer. The levels of extracellular mesolimbic dopamine show circadian oscillations and mark the ""wanting"" for pro-homeostatic stimuli. Further, the dopamine levels decrease during waking and are replenished during sleep, in opposition to sleep propensity. The wanting of sleep, therefore, may explain the  homeostatic and circadian regulation of sleep. Accordingly, sleep onset occurs when the displeasure of excessive waking is maximal, coinciding with the minimal  levels of mesolimbic dopamine. Reciprocally, sleep ends after having replenished  the limbic dopamine levels. Given the direct relation between waking and mesolimbic dopamine, sleep must serve primarily to gain an efficient waking. Pleasant sleep (i.e. emotional sleep), can only exist in animals capable of feeling emotions. Therefore, although sleep-like states have been described in invertebrates and primitive vertebrates, the association sleep-pleasure clearly marks a difference between the sleep of homeothermic vertebrates and cool blooded animals.",0
"Although it is possible to observe when another person is having an emotional moment, we also derive information about the affective states of others from what they tell us they are feeling. In an effort to distill the complexity of affective experience, psychologists routinely focus on a simplified subset of subjective rating scales (i.e., dimensions) that capture considerable variability in reported affect: reported valence (i.e., how good or bad?) and reported arousal (e.g., how strong is the emotion you are feeling?). Still, existing theoretical approaches address the basic organization and measurement of these affective dimensions differently. Some approaches organize affect around the dimensions of bipolar valence and arousal (e.g., the circumplex model), whereas alternative approaches organize affect around the dimensions of unipolar positivity and unipolar negativity (e.g., the bivariate evaluative model). In this report, we (a) replicate the data structure observed when collected according to the two approaches described above, and reinterpret these data to suggest that the relationship between each pair of affective dimensions is conditional on valence ambiguity, and (b) formalize this structure with a mathematical model depicting a valence ambiguity dimension that decreases in range as arousal decreases (a triangle). This model captures variability in affective ratings better than alternative approaches, increasing variance explained from ~60% to over 90% without adding parameters.",1
"The physical technique of slow, long distance running and the mental centering devices of T. M. are combined, using hypnosis in some cases, to enhance a ""peak experience,"" or altered state of consciousness. Indications and contraindications to this technique are described for various psychiatric, psychosomatic and somatic syndromes, and its use as an adjunct to formal individual and group psychotherapy is discussed.",0
"BACKGROUND: Based on introspectionist, semantic, and psychophysiological experimental frameworks, it has long been assumed that all affective states derive from two independent basic dimensions, valence and arousal. However, until now, no study has investigated whether valence and arousal are also dissociable at the level of affect-related changes in cognitive processing. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined how changes in both valence (negative vs. positive) and arousal (low vs. high) influence performance in tasks requiring executive control because recent research indicates that two dissociable cognitive components are involved in the regulation of task performance: amount of current control (i.e., strength of filtering goal-irrelevant signals) and control adaptation (i.e., strength of maintaining current goals over time). Using a visual pop-out distractor task, we found that control is exclusively modulated by arousal because interference by goal-irrelevant signals was largest in high arousal states, independently of valence. By contrast, control adaptation is exclusively modulated by valence because the increase in control after trials in which goal-irrelevant signals were present was largest in negative states, independent of arousal. A Monte Carlo simulation revealed that differential effects of two experimental factors on control and control adaptation can be dissociated if there is no correlation between empirical interference and conflict-driven modulation of interference, which was the case in the present data. Consequently, the observed effects of valence and arousal on adaptive executive control are indeed dissociable. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicate that affective influences on cognitive processes can be driven by independent effects of variations in valence and arousal, which may resolve several heterogeneous findings observed in previous studies on affect-cognition interactions.",1
"Family caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease are at high risk of psychological and physical morbidity due to the daily caring experience.OBJECTIVES: to evaluate the impact of a psychoeducational program involving relaxation techniques on caregivers' burden and mental health status. METHODS: in this prospective study, 50 family caregivers were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: standard (CG: Control group; 12 × 90 minutes weekly sessions: psychoeducational group intervention) and experimental intervention (RG: Relaxation group; 12 × 150 minutes sessions: standard intervention + relaxation techniques). Caregivers' burden and mental health status were assessed using the Zarit burden interview (global score and three dimensions from the factor analysis of the French version: social consequences, psychological burden  and feelings of guilt) and the General health questionnaire-28 at baseline, after 3 (M3) and 6-months follow-up. Inter-individual statistics and intra-individual changes were calculated. RESULTS: social consequences and psychological burden decreased in RG. The between-group analysis showed that social consequences scores at M3 improved more in RG than in CG. No change in mental health was observed. For burden and anxiety/insomnia, intra-individual analyses showed that RG intervention was beneficial for more carers than CG intervention. DISCUSSION: this study suggests that integrating relaxation techniques into psychoeducational interventions is beneficial for caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease.",0
"We examined age-related differences in memory for identity and emotional expression of unfamiliar faces. Younger and older adults were presented with happy and angry faces and were later asked to recognise the same faces displaying a neutral expression. When a face was recognised, they also had to remember what  the initial expression of the face had been. In addition, states of awareness associated with both identity and expression memory were assessed with the remember/know/guess paradigm. Older adults showed less recollective experience than younger adults for identity but not for emotional expressions of the faces.  This evidence indicates that age-related differences in memory may depend on the  nature of the to-be-remembered information, with emotional/social information being remembered as well in older as in younger adults.",0
"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Plasma citrulline concentration is considered to be a marker for enterocyte metabolic mass and to reflect its reduction as may occur during intestinal dysfunction. Strenuous exercise can act as a stressor to induce small  intestinal injury. Our previous studies suggest that this comprises the intestinal ability to produce citrulline from a glutamine-rich protein bolus. In  this study we investigated the effects of different exercise intensities and hydration state on citrulline and iFABP levels following a post-exercise glutamine bolus in healthy young men. METHODS: Fifteen healthy young men (20-35 yrs, VO2 max 56.9 ± 3.9 ml kg-1 min-1)  performed in a randomly assigned cross-over design, a rest (protocol 1) and four  cycle ergometer protocols. The volunteers cycled submaximal at different percentages of their individual pre-assessed maximum workload (Wmax): 70% Wmax in hydrated (protocol 2) and dehydrated state (protocol 3), 50% Wmax (protocol 4) and intermittent 85/55% Wmax in blocks of 2 min (protocol 5). Immediately after 1 h exercise or rest, subjects were given a glutamine bolus with added alanine as an iso-caloric internal standard (7.5 g of each amino acid). Blood samples were collected before, during and after rest or exercise, up to 24 h post onset of the experiment. Amino acids and urea were analysed as metabolic markers, creatine phosphokinase and iFABP as markers of muscle and intestinal damage, respectively. Data were analysed using a multilevel mixed linear statistical model. p values were corrected for multiple testing. RESULTS: Citrulline levels already increased before glutamine supplementation during normal hydrated exercise, while this was not observed in the dehydrated and rest protocols. The low intensity exercise protocol (50% Wmax) showed the highest increase in citrulline levels both during exercise (43.83 μmol/L ± 2.63 (p < 0.001)) and after glutamine consumption (50.54 μmol/L ± 2.62) compared to the rest protocol (28.97 μmol/L ± 1.503 and 41.65 μmol/L ± 1.96, respectively, p < 0.05). However, following strenuous exercise at 70% Wmax in the dehydrated state, citrulline levels did not increase during exercise and less after the glutamine consumption when compared to the resting condition and hydrated protocols. In line with this, serum iFABP levels were the highest with the strenuous dehydrated protocol (1443.72 μmol/L ± 249.9, p < 0.001), followed by the high intensity exercise at 70% Wmax in the hydrated condition. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise induces an increase in plasma citrulline, irrespective of a glutamine bolus. The extent to which this occurs is dependent on exercise intensity and the hydration state of the subjects. The same holds true for both the post-exercise increase in citrulline levels following glutamine supplementation and serum iFABP levels. These data indicate that citrulline release during exercise and after an oral glutamine bolus might be dependent on the intestinal health state and therefore on intestinal functionality. Glutamine  is known to play a major role in intestinal physiology and the maintenance of gut health and barrier function. Together, this suggests that in clinical practice, a glutamine bolus to increase citrulline levels after exercise might be preferable  compared to supplementing citrulline itself. To our knowledge this is the first time that exercise workload-related effects on plasma citrulline are reported in  relation to intestinal damage.",0
"Multiple studies suggest that physical activity causes positive affective reactions and reduces depressive mood. However, studies and interventions focused mostly on structured activity programs, but rarely on actual physical activity (aPA) in daily life. Furthermore, they seldom account for the context in which the aPA occur (e.g., work, leisure). Using a prospective, real-time assessment design (ambulatory assessment), we investigated the effects of aPA on affective states (valence, energetic arousal, calmness) in real-time during everyday life while controlling for the context. Eighty-seven undergraduates students (Age: M = 24.6; SD = 3.2, females: 54%) participated in this study. aPA was assessed through accelerometers during 24-h. Palmtop devices prompted subjects approximately every 45 min during a 14-h daytime period to assess their affective states and the context. We analyzed within- and between-person effects with hierarchical modeling (HLM 6.0). Multilevel analyses revealed that both aPA and context influenced subsequent affective states. The interaction of aPA and context did predict energetic arousal only. State levels of affects did not differ between men and women. For both men and women, aPA in everyday life has an effect on individual's affective states. For valence and calmness, it seems to be independent of the context in which the aPA occur. For energetic arousal, men reported to have lower feelings of energy and women reported to have more feelings of energy during leisure time compared to working episodes.",1
"Objective. To share experiences from a project that integrates a mental health intervention within a developmental framework of microcredit activity for economically underprivileged women in rural India. Method. The mental health intervention had two components: group counseling and stress management. The former comprised of ventilation and reassurance and the latter strengthening of coping skills and a relaxation technique. Focus group discussions were used to understand women's perception of how microcredit economic activity and the mental health intervention had affected their lives. Results. Women in the mental health intervention group reported reduction in psychological distress and bodily aches  and pains. Majority (86%) reported that the quality of their sleep had improved with regular practice of relaxation and that sharing their problems in the group  had helped them to unburden. The social support extended by the members to each other, made them feel that they were not alone and could face any life situation. Conclusion. The study provided qualitative evidence that adding the mental health intervention to the ongoing economic activity had made a positive difference in the lives of the women. Addressing mental health concerns along with livelihood initiatives can help to enhance both economic and social capital in rural poor women.",0
"BACKGROUND: Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are a valuable research model because of their behavioral, physiological and neuroanatomical similarities to humans. In the absence of language, autonomic activity can provide crucial information about cognitive and affective states during single-unit recording, inactivation and lesion studies. Methods standardized for use in humans are not easily adapted to NHPs and detailed guidance has been lacking. NEW METHOD: We provide guidance for monitoring heart rate and pupil size in the behavioral neurophysiology setting by addressing the methodological issues, pitfalls and solutions for NHP studies. The methods are based on comparative physiology to establish a rationale for each solution. We include examples from both electrophysiological and lesion studies. RESULTS: Single-unit recording, pupil responses and heart rate changes represent a range of decreasing temporal resolution, a characteristic that impacts experimental design and analysis. We demonstrate the unexpected result that autonomic measures acquired before and after amygdala lesions are comparable despite disruption of normal autonomic function. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Species and study design differences can render standard techniques used in human studies inappropriate for NHP studies. We show how to manage data from small groups typical of NHP studies, data from the short behavioral trials typical of neurophysiological studies, issues associated with longitudinal studies, and differences in anatomy and physiology. CONCLUSIONS: Autonomic measurement to infer cognitive and affective states in NHP is neither off-the-shelf nor onerous. Familiarity with the issues and solutions will broaden the use of autonomic signals in NHP single unit and lesion studies.",1
"Perceptual learning, improvement in discriminative ability as a consequence of training, is one of the forms of sensory system plasticity that has driven profound changes in our conceptualization of sensory cortical function. Psychophysical and neurophysiological studies of auditory perceptual learning have indicated that the characteristics of the learning, and by implication the nature of the underlying neural changes, are highly task specific. Some studies in animals have indicated that recruitment of neurons to the population responding to the training stimuli, and hence an increase in the so-called cortical ""area of representation"" of those stimuli, is the substrate of improved  performance, but such changes have not been observed in other studies. A possible reconciliation of these conflicting results is provided by evidence that changes  in area of representation constitute a transient stage in the processes underlying perceptual learning. This expansion - renormalization hypothesis is supported by evidence from studies of the learning of motor skills, another form  of procedural learning, but leaves open the nature of the permanent neural substrate of improved performance. Other studies have suggested that the substrate might be reduced response variability - a decrease in internal noise. Neuroimaging studies in humans have also provided compelling evidence that training results in long-term changes in auditory cortical function and in the auditory brainstem frequency-following response. Musical training provides a valuable model, but the evidence it provides is qualified by the fact that most such training is multimodal and sensorimotor, and that few of the studies are experimental and allow control over confounding variables. More generally, the overwhelming majority of experimental studies of the various forms of auditory perceptual learning have established the co-occurrence of neural and perceptual changes, but have not established that the former are causally related to the latter. Important forms of perceptual learning in humans are those involved in language acquisition and in the improvement in speech perception performance of post-lingually deaf cochlear implantees over the months following implantation. The development of a range of auditory training programs has focused interest on  the factors determining the extent to which perceptual learning is specific or generalises to tasks other than those used in training. The context specificity demonstrated in a number of studies of perceptual learning suggests a multiplexing model, in which learning relating to a particular stimulus attribute depends on a subset of the diverse inputs to a given cortical neuron being strengthened, and different subsets being gated by top-down influences. This hypothesis avoids the difficulty of balancing system stability with plasticity, which is a problem for recruitment hypotheses. The characteristics of auditory perceptual learning reflect the fact that auditory cortex forms part of distributed networks that integrate the representation of auditory stimuli with attention, decision, and reward processes.",0
"Humans experience emotions every day. Traditionally, psychology has described emotions through discrete labels (e.g. happy, afraid) or standardized affective dimensions (e.g. valence, arousal), and neuroscience has more recently sought the neurobiological basis of emotions via functional neuroimaging. However, by treating emotions similarly among everyone, we neglect that emotions are individualized; thus the overall relational structure of an individual's emotion information may be vital in understanding how the brain represents emotions. Combining behavioral and functional MRI experiments with similarity analyses, we demonstrate that neural activity patterns in the left insula correspond to the multi-dimensional arrangement of individuals' affective spaces, despite interindividual differences, better than to a group-averaged model of affective space, a standardized valence-arousal space, a semantic category space, and a visual similarity space. This finding suggests that the insula may underlie individual-level affective information processing that is specific to one's own affective states, which offers new opportunities for functional neuroimaging to inform clinical approaches of disorders involving emotion dysregulation.",1
"Whether emotion is universal or social is a recurrent issue in the history of emotion study among psychologists. Some researchers view emotion as a universal construct, and that a large part of emotional experience is biologically based. However, emotion is not only biologically determined, but is also influenced by the environment. Therefore, cultural differences exist in some aspects of emotions, one such important aspect of emotion being emotional arousal level. All affective states are systematically represented as two bipolar dimensions, valence and arousal. Arousal level of actual and ideal emotions has consistently been found to have cross-cultural differences. In Western or individualist culture, high arousal emotions are valued and promoted more than low arousal emotions. Moreover, Westerners experience high arousal emotions more than low arousal emotions. By contrast, in Eastern or collectivist culture, low arousal emotions are valued more than high arousal emotions. Moreover, people in the East actually experience and prefer to experience low arousal emotions more than high arousal emotions. Mechanism of these cross-cultural differences and implications are also discussed.",1
"INTRODUCTION: The recent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) provided a dimensional model of personality disorders grounded on the empirical validated concept of maladaptive personality traits. Accordingly, based on this model, the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 Brief Form (PID-5-BF) enables  the identification of maladaptive personality traits in 5 dimensions: Negative Affect, Detachment, Antagonism, Disinhibition and Psychoticism. Former studies showed, that this self-report measure can reliably predict the likelihood of the  development of personality disorders. AIM: We aimed to develop the Hungarian version of the PID-5-BF and to verify its  construct-, concurrent-, predictive-, and discriminative validity. METHOD: Based on the results of former studies regarding PID-5-BF, we asked 379 participants to fill out several selfreport measures. Besides PID-5-BF, the Bipolar Rating Scale for the Big Five Personality, the Unconventionality subscale from the Openness scale of the HEXACO model and the Interpersonal Problems-Personality Disorders-25 were also administered. RESULTS: According to the original 5 factor version, the fit of our model was acceptable (CFI = 0,868; RMSEA = 0,061 [90% CI = 0,055 - 0,068]; Cronbach-alpha = 0,61-0,79). In our view, the results vindicate the reliability and validity of the Hungarian PID-5-BF. CONCLUSIONS: According to former studies along with our recent findings, the PID-5-BF can be seen as an effective and reliable self-report scale for clinical  studies and at the same time, it may be useful for the psychiatric diagnostic process, mainly in the case of personality disorders. With more clinical data and knowledge, this inventory could be useful for psychiatrists and clinical psychologists in planning of clinical treatment.",0
"Emotions are predicted to influence judgement and decision-making across a range of performance contexts. This experiment tested whether motivational-general arousal imagery can improve the decision-making performance of elite endurance cyclists. In total, 54 cyclists (38 men, 16 women) were assigned to either a positive imagery condition (where positive images associated with the affective experience of winning were encouraged) or a negative imagery condition (where negative images associated with poor performance were encouraged). The cyclists were read one of two scripts designed to elicit positive or negative images during a 20-min maximal sustainable interval on a cycle ergometer. A decision-making task (colour-word match Stroop) was performed before and immediately after the maximal sustainable power interval. Results showed that the manipulation was successful with cyclists in the positive imagery condition reporting more positive affective states (higher levels of happiness and lower levels of dejection) than those in the negative imagery condition. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in their decision-making performance under physiological duress. These findings indicate that while motivational-general arousal imagery might be a useful method to induce positive emotions during exercise, it is unlikely to improve the decision-making performance of cyclists in performance-relevant conditions.",1
"Brain activity was monitored while participants viewed picture sets that reflected high or low levels of arousal and positive, neutral, or negative valence. Pictures within a set were presented rapidly in an incidental viewing task while fMRI data were collected. The primary purpose of the study was to determine if multi-voxel pattern analysis could be used within and between participants to predict valence, arousal and combined affective states elicited by pictures based on distributed patterns of whole brain activity. A secondary purpose was to determine if distributed patterns of whole brain activity can be used to derive a lower dimensional representation of affective states consistent with behavioral data. Results demonstrated above chance prediction of valence, arousal and affective states that was robust across a wide range of number of voxels used in prediction. Additionally, individual differences multidimensional scaling based on fMRI data clearly separated valence and arousal levels and was consistent with a circumplex model of affective states.",1
"BACKGROUND: Jumping to conclusions (JTC), which is the proneness to require less  information before forming beliefs or making a decision, has been related to formation and maintenance of delusions. Using data from the National Institute of Health Research Biomedical Research Centre Genetics and Psychosis (GAP) case-control study of first-episode psychosis (FEP), we set out to test whether the presence of JTC would predict poor clinical outcome at 4 years. METHODS: One-hundred and twenty-three FEP patients were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and the probabilistic reasoning 'Beads' Task at the time of recruitment. The sample was split into two groups based on the presence of JTC bias. Follow-up data over an average of 4 years were obtained concerning clinical course and outcomes (remission, intervention of police, use of involuntary treatment - the Mental Health Act (MHA) - and inpatient days). RESULTS: FEP who presented JTC at baseline were more likely during the follow-up  period to be detained under the MHA [adjusted OR 15.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.92-83.54, p = 0.001], require intervention by the police (adjusted OR 14.95, 95% CI 2.68-83.34, p = 0.002) and have longer admissions (adjusted IRR = 5.03, 95% CI 1.91-13.24, p = 0.001). These associations were not accounted for by socio-demographic variables, IQ and symptom dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: JTC in FEP is associated with poorer outcome as indicated and defined by more compulsion police intervention and longer periods of admission. Our findings raise the question of whether the implementation of specific interventions to reduce JTC, such as Metacognition Training, may be a useful addition in early psychosis intervention programmes.",0
"Nonhuman primates constitute an indispensable model system for studying higher brain functions at the neurophysiological level. Studies involving these animals  elucidated the neuronal mechanisms of various cognitive and executive functions,  such as visual attention, working memory, and decision-making. Positive reinforcement training (PRT) constitutes the gold standard for training animals on the cognitive tasks employed in these studies. In the laboratory, PRT is usually based on application of a liquid reward as the reinforcer to strengthen the desired behavior and absence of the reward if the animal's response is wrong. By trial and error, the monkey may adapt its behavior and successfully reduce the number of error trials, and eventually learn even very sophisticated tasks. However, progress and success of the training strongly depend on reasonable error rates. If errors get too frequent, they may cause a drop in the animal's motivation to cooperate or its adaptation to high error rates and poor overall performance. We introduce in this report an alternative training regime to minimize errors and base the critical information for learning on graded rewarding. For every new task rule, the feedback to the animal is provided by different amounts of reward to distinguish the desired, optimal behavior from less optimal behavior. We applied this regime in different situations during training of visual attention tasks and analyzed behavioral performance and reaction times to evaluate its effectiveness. For both simple and complex behaviors, graded rewarding was found to constitute a powerful technique allowing for effective training without trade-off in accessible task difficulty or task performance. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Laboratory training of monkeys usually builds on providing a fixed amount of reward for the desired behavior, and no reward otherwise. We present a nonbinary, graded reward schedule to emphasize the positive, desired behavior and to keep errors on a moderate level. Using data from typical training situations, we demonstrate that graded rewards help to effectively guide the animal by success rather than errors and provide a powerful new tool for positive reinforcement training.",0
"Monoaminergic modulation of cortical and thalamic inputs to the dorsal striatum (DS) is crucial for reward-based learning and action control. While dopamine has  been extensively investigated in this context, the synaptic effects of serotonin  (5-HT) have been largely unexplored. Here, we investigated how serotonergic signaling affects associative plasticity at glutamatergic synapses on the striatal projection neurons of the direct pathway (dSPNs). Combining chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches reveals that impeding serotonergic signaling preferentially gates spike-timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) at thalamostriatal synapses. This t-LTD requires dampened activity of the 5-HT4 receptor subtype, which we demonstrate controls dendritic Ca2+ signals by regulating BK channel activity, and which preferentially localizes at the dendritic shaft. The synaptic effects of 5-HT signaling at thalamostriatal inputs provide insights into how changes in serotonergic levels associated with behavioral states or pathology affect striatal-dependent processes.",0
"BACKGROUND: Substantial evidence shows that physical activities of daily living are positively correlated with affective states in middle-aged and older adults. However, people's physical activity decreases when they grow older, and conditions that enhance older individuals' physical activities of daily living are not well understood. PURPOSE: This study investigated need satisfaction (competence, relatedness, and autonomy) and its moderating effect on the within-subject relation between physical activities of daily living and three dimensions of affective states (valence, energetic arousal, and calmness) based on an ambulatory assessment that used activity-triggered e-diaries. METHOD: The physical activities of daily living of 68 adults aged 50+ (mean age = 60.1 +/- 7.1) were measured objectively for three consecutive days, and need satisfaction and affective states were assessed as a function of the amount of physical activity during the preceding 10 min before the affect measurement (in activity-triggered e-diaries). Hierarchical multilevel analyses were performed. RESULTS: Need satisfaction was significantly and positively correlated with the three dimensions of affective states. Further, physical activities of daily living were significantly associated with energetic arousal and calmness, but not valence. However, when physical activities of daily living were more autonomously regulated, the association of physical activities of daily living and valence became significant and positive. CONCLUSION: The findings regarding the significant moderating effects of need satisfaction are crucial for interventions aiming to improve the health-enhancing effects of physical activity in adults aged 50+. Positive feelings owing to physical activities in daily living depend on the extent that psychological needs are satisfied.",1
"Decline in cognitive functions, including hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, is commonly observed at a later stage of aging (e.g., >20 months old in rodents)  and typically studied after a discrete learning event. How normal aging, particularly at an early stage, affects the modulatory aspect of memory persistence is underinvestigated. Previous studies in young animals show that weak, fading memories can last longer if a modulating event, such as spatial novelty, is introduced around memory encoding. This is known as behavioral tagging and capture (BTC). Here, we investigated how early aging (10-13 months old) affects BTC in an appetitive delayed-matching-to-place task. We trained rats when they were young and middle aged and found that novelty facilitated long-term memory persistence in young but not in middle-aged rats. However, re-exposure to  the encoded environment after learning improved memory persistence in middle-aged rats. BTC, combined with memory reactivation, facilitated memory persistence through reconsolidation. Our results point toward a weakened tagging and capture  mechanism before reduction of plasticity-related proteins at an early stage of aging.",0
"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to verify psychometric properties of the Polish version of the Job-related Affective Well-being Scale (JAWS). Specifically, theoretical 4-factor structure (based on the dimensions of pleasure and arousal) and reliability of the original - 20-item JAWS (van Katwyk et al., 2000) and the shortened - 12-item (Schaufeli and Van Rhenen, 2006) versions were tested. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two independent samples were analyzed (police officers, N = 395, and police recruits, N = 202). The Polish version of the original, 20-item, JAWS was used to measure job-related affective states across the past month (van Katwyk et al., 2000). This version of JAWS includes 2 dimensions: valence and arousal, which allow to assess 4 categories of emotions: low-arousal positive emotions, high-arousal positive emotions, low-arousal negative emotions and high-arousal negative emotions. RESULTS: The results of multidimensional scaling analysis showed that the theoretical circumplex model of emotions underlining JAWS was satisfactorily reproduced. Also the hypothesized 4-factor structure of the Polish version of JAWS was confirmed. The 12-item version had better fit with the data than the original, 20-item, version, but the best fit was obtained for the even shorter, 8-item version. This version emerged from a multidimensional scaling of the 12-item version. Reliabilities of the 20- and 12-item versions were good, with lower values for the 8-item JAWS version. CONCLUSIONS: The findings confirmed satisfactory psychometric properties of both Polish versions of the Job-related Affective Well-being Scale. Thus, when both psychometric properties and relevance for cross-cultural comparisons are considered, the 12-item JAWS is recommended as a version of choice.",1
"Starting from psychopathological and psychosomatic research, differences as well  as interplay in periodicity and rhythm are worked out. While analytical psychotherapy deals with periodic-phasic disturbances, ""functional relaxation"" does so with rhythmical ones. Both processes in their dovetailing are made plain  through case histories, in which periodic-phasic disturbances may also lead to rhythmical ones and vice versa. Treatment of bodily manifest disturbances of rhythm by ""functional relaxation"" cures or prevents periodically recurrent illness not only individually but does so with following generations too.",0
"Friedman and Forster (2010) reviewed an extensive program of research that was consistent with the view that positive affective states broaden, whereas negative affective states narrow, the scope of attention. We applaud their creative investigations into these important psychological questions and appreciate their thorough review. However, recent evidence strongly suggests that the conclusions drawn by Friedman and Forster need to be tempered, for the recent evidence suggests that motivational intensity rather than affective valence causes the modulations of attentional tuning. That is, affective states of low motivational intensity (e.g., sadness, postgoal positive affect) broaden attention, whereas affective states of high motivational intensity (e.g., disgust, pregoal positive affect) narrow attention. Our viewpoint is that attentional narrowing occurs during affective states of high motivational intensity to aid organisms in acquiring desirable objects and avoiding aversive ones. Attentional broadening occurs during affective states of low motivational intensity to open organisms to new opportunities.",1
"CONTEXT: Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common complications of diabetes. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of photon stimulation on pain intensity, pain relief, pain qualities, sensation and quality of life (QOL) in patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients were assigned to  receive either four photon stimulations (n=63) or four placebo (n=58) treatments. Pain intensity, pain relief, and pain qualities were assessed using self-report questionnaires. Sensation was evaluated using monofilament testing. QOL was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36). Multilevel regression model analyses were used to evaluate between-group differences in study outcomes. RESULTS: No differences, over time, in any pain intensity scores (i.e., pain intensity immediately post-treatment, average pain, worst pain) or pain relief scores were found between the placebo and treatment groups. However, significant  decreases, over time, were found in some pain quality scores, and significant improvements in sensation were found in patients who received the photon stimulation compared with placebo. In addition, patients in the treatment group reported significant improvements in SF-36 social functioning and mental health scores. Findings from a responder analysis demonstrated that no differences were  found in the percentages of patients in the placebo and treatment groups who received 30% or more or 50% or more reduction in pain scores immediately post-treatment. However, significant differences were found in the distribution of the changes in pain relief scores, with most of the patients in the photon stimulation group reporting a slight (28.6%) to moderate (34.9%) improvement in pain relief from the beginning to the end of the study compared with no change in pain relief (43.1%) in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Four treatments with photon stimulation resulted in significant improvements in some pain qualities, sensation, and QOL outcomes in a sample of patients with a significant amount of pain and disability from their diabetes. A  longer duration study is needed to further refine the photon stimulation treatment protocol in these chronically ill patients and to evaluate the sustainability of its effects.",0
"OBJECTIVE: The authors used color photographs of emotional and neutral expressions to investigate recognition patterns of five universal emotions in schizophrenia. METHOD: Twenty-eight stable outpatients with schizophrenia (19 men and nine women) and 61 healthy subjects (29 men and 32 women) completed an emotion discrimination test that presented mild and extreme intensities of happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgusted, and neutral faces, balanced for gender and ethnicity.  Analyses evaluated accuracy of identifying emotions as a function of intensity, diagnosis, and gender of poser and rater. RESULTS: Patients performed worse than comparison subjects on recognition of all  emotions and neutral faces combined, including mild and extreme expressions. For  specific emotions, patients performed worse on recognition of fearful, disgusted, and neutral expressions. For all emotions except disgust, recognition of extreme  intensity was better than recognition of mild intensity. However, patients showed less benefit from increased intensity for all emotions combined, and the difference was most pronounced for fear. Thus, patients were more impaired than healthy comparison subjects in identifying high-intensity expressions, even though this was an easier task than identifying low-intensity expressions. In the comparison of patterns of errors, patients and healthy subjects differed only in  misattributions of neutral expressions; patients overattributed disgusted expressions and underattributed happy expressions. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with schizophrenia were impaired in overall emotion recognition, particularly fear and disgust, and did not benefit from increased emotional intensity. Error patterns indicate that patients misidentified neutral  cues as negatively valenced.",0
"We tested whether (1) the capacity of a reward-associated conditioned stimulus (CS) to cause conditioned activation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons is associated with its capacity to elicit conditioned approach responses and (2) whether the acquisition of these capacities by a CS requires N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and muscarinic acetylcholine (mACh) receptor stimulation. Rats were trained to emit a conditioned approach response to a light CS that was previously paired with food and were treated systemically with scopolamine (a mACh receptor antagonist) or MK-801 (an NMDA receptor antagonist)  either prior to each conditioning session (during which animals experienced paired CS and food presentations) or prior to the conditioned approach (CS-only)  test. Brains were harvested after the CS-only test and processed for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (DA cells) and c-fos in the VTA. When animals received scopolamine or MK-801 treatment prior to conditioning sessions we observed significantly fewer TH-labeled (i.e., DA) cells in the VTA that expressed c-fos and significantly less conditioned approach responding during the CS-only test. Further analysis showed a correlation between the number of VTA DA cells activated and the number of conditioned approach responses. Treatments made prior to the CS-only test did not affect responding. Altogether these results suggest that the degree to which a CS elicits conditioned approach depends partially on the degree to which the CS activates VTA DA cells and that the acquisition of both of these capacities by a CS requires mACh and NMDA receptor stimulation.",0
"In 2002, the Institute of Medicine highlighted community partnerships as important in strategies for ensuring the public's health in the 21st century. Whether defined narrowly as the neighborhood or more broadly as the entire nation, communities represent settings in which health is supported and protected by healthy social connections and environments or risked and damaged by detrimental social, environmental, and policy determinants, as well as adverse behavioral and lifestyle choices. In this article, cardiovascular disease in African Americans is used as an example to highlight the successes achieved during the last half-century in reducing mortality rates, the persisting challenge of suboptimal adoption of evidence-based practices to promote community health and prevent disease, and the still widespread and pervasive health disparities. The article concludes with a call for the scientific community to embrace implementation research in strategic partnership with community stakeholders to stem the tide of cardiovascular disease and reduce related cardiovascular health disparities.",0
"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a worldwide health problem caused by resistance to insulin action. This chronic debilitating diseaseis preceded by a stage, known as prediabetes, in which a healthy lifestyle can delay the disease.  The discovery of biochemical changes in prediabetes is important to identify individuals at risk of developing T2DM and in explaining disease pathogenesis. Adiponectin is secreted by fat cells and is linked with insulin resistance. Adiponectin levels are dysregulated in prediabetic subjects. This relationship had not been tested in Jordan. We recruited 130 subjects with prediabetes and 130 control subjects. We measured serum levels of adiponectin and genotyped subjects  for three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ADIPOQ gene; rs266729, rs1501299 and rs2241766. In multivariate analysis, we found that serum adiponectin lowers the risk of prediabetes (p = 0.002; odds ratio (OR), 0.764; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.646⁻0.905). The rs1501299 SNP of the ADIPOQ gene  was associated with prediabetes in our population (p = 0.041). Specifically, in multivariate analysis, the GT genotype of rs1501299 increased the risk of prediabetes (p = 0.010; OR, 2.350; 95% CI, 1.231⁻4.486) as well as the TT genotype (p = 0.006; OR, 4.774; 95% CI, 1.551⁻14.693). Our findings indicate that serum adiponectin and SNPs in the ADIPOQ gene are associated with prediabetes in  Jordan.",0
"Insight into the emotional lives of animals is of utmost importance to the welfare of the billions of animals in our care, yet little is known about how to measure these states. Scientific understanding of how to measure and interpret positive emotional states is particularly lacking, although recent years have seen a notable increase in such studies. This study explored whether the percentage of visible eye whites is a valid measure of a low arousal, positive emotional state in dairy cows (Bos taurus), by using stroking as the positive stimulus. Thirteen dairy cows were studied over a period of two months, and a total of 372 full 15minute focal observations were performed. Each focal observation comprised three 5minute phases: pre-stroking (baseline), stroking (stimulus), and post-stroking (post-stimulus), and the focal cow's behaviours were recorded throughout each observation, and the focal eye was filmed for later analysis. Following data collection we calculated the percentage of visible eye white at nine pre-determined measurement points throughout each focal observation. The eye white data were analysed using the one-way repeated measures ANOVA test. The percentage of visible eye white dropped during stroking compared with during both the pre-stroking and post-stroking phases (ANOVA: F1.242, 14.9=4.32, P=0.025). The behaviours were analysed using Friedman's ANOVA and Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. Behaviours known to be associated with positive emotions in cows were performed during the stroking phase of the focal observation, supporting the use of stroking as a stimulus to induce a positive, low arousal emotional state. This study has explored the potential of visible eye whites as a measure of positive emotions and arousal, and our results support previous studies which suggest that eye whites may serve as a dynamic measure of emotion and arousal.",1
"Human emotion recognition (HER) allows the assessment of an affective state of a subject. Until recently, such emotional states were described in terms of discrete emotions, like happiness or contempt. In order to cover a high range of emotions, researchers in the field have introduced different dimensional spaces for emotion description that allow the characterization of affective states in terms of several variables or dimensions that measure distinct aspects of the emotion. One of the most common of such dimensional spaces is the bidimensional Arousal/Valence space. To the best of our knowledge, all HER systems so far have modelled independently, the dimensions in these dimensional spaces. In this paper, we study the effect of modelling the output dimensions simultaneously and show experimentally the advantages in modeling them in this way. We consider a multimodal approach by including features from the Electroencephalogram and a few physiological signals. For modelling the multiple outputs, we employ a multiple output regressor based on support vector machines. We also include an stage of feature selection that is developed within an embedded approach known as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), proposed initially for SVM. The results show that several features can be eliminated using the multiple output support vector regressor with RFE without affecting the performance of the regressor. From the analysis of the features selected in smaller subsets via RFE, it can be observed that the signals that are more informative into the arousal and valence space discrimination are the EEG, Electrooculogram/Electromiogram (EOG/EMG) and the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR).",1
"Pupil size is usually regarded as a passive information channel that provides insight into cognitive and affective states but defies any further control. However, in a recent study (Ehlers et al. 2015) we demonstrate that sympathetic activity indexed by pupil dynamics allows strategic interference by means of simple cognitive techniques. Utilizing positive/negative imaginings, subjects were able to expand pupil diameter beyond baseline variations; albeit with varying degrees of success and only over brief periods. The current study provides a comprehensive replication on the basis of considerable changes to the experimental set-up. Results show that stricter methodological conditions (controlled baseline settings and specified user instructions) strengthen the reported effect, whereas overall performance increases by one standard deviation. Effects are thereby not restricted to pupillary level. Parallel recordings of skin conductance changes prove a general enhancement of induced autonomic arousal. Considering the stability of the results across studies, we conclude that pupil size information exceeds affective monitoring and may constitute an active input channel in human-computer interaction. Furthermore, since variations in pupil diameter reliably display self-induced changes in sympathetic arousal, the relevance of this parameter is strongly indicated for future approaches in clinical biofeedback.",1
"BACKGROUND: The 2004 tsunami seriously affected millions of families in several developing countries by destroying their livelihoods, houses and communities, subsequently damaging social and physical resources. Disaster studies have documented that both post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression develop during the first six months following disaster exposure for the majority of those afflicted. AIMS: and METHODS: Using data from 325 tsunami-affected families living in southern Sri Lanka, the current study investigates whether community social resources such as  residents' perceived community participation in tsunami recovery efforts reduce mental health risks (PTSD and depressive symptoms) of tsunami-affected mothers. The analysis is based on structural equation modelling. RESULTS: and CONCLUSIONS: The findings of structural equation modelling supports the main hypothesis that residents' perceived community participation directly and indirectly (through collective family functioning and mental health service use)  reduces mental health risks (both PTSD and depressive symptoms) of tsunami-affected mothers after controlling for pre-tsunami family adversities. In addition, the results show that residents' perceived community participation buffers the influence of trauma exposure on PTSD symptom levels of mothers. The identification of specific social and family processes that relate to mental health can be useful for post-disaster interventions and recovery programmes.",0
"A devastating earthquake occurred on May 12, 2008 in Sichuan, China. This study investigated the prevalence and factors in association with psychological problems among secondary school students living in Chengdu (90 km away from the disaster epicenter) in June 2008. In a cross-sectional survey, 3,324 secondary students self-administered a structured questionnaire in classroom setting. Validated scales were used in this study. Among all respondents, 22.3% reported post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); 22.6% were probable depression cases; 10.6% reported suicidal ideation; and 14.1% would like to receive psychological counseling. No gender differences were found. While social/emotional support from teachers or peers (OR from 0.40 to 0.78) and exposure to positive news reports (OR from 0.59 to 0.62) were found protective, prior experience of severe mental distress (OR from 1.60 to 2.68) and corporal punishment (OR from 1.31 to 1.58), worry about future aftershocks (OR from 1.64 to 3.11), absence from school when it was not closed (OR from 1.38 to 1.48), exposures to scary or sorrowful disaster media coverage (OR from 1.39 to 2.07), post-disaster visits to affected  sites (OR from 1.51 to 1.59), separation from parents (OR = 1.61), etc., were risk factors predictive of some of the aforementioned psychological problems. Negative mental health impacts were prevalent among the respondents. Teachers, parents, and the mass media are all important in maintaining good mental health among adolescents that are indirectly affected by the severe earthquake. The results have important implications for earthquake preparedness and relief work in the future.",0
"Recent investigations emphasized the role of communication features on behavioral trust and reciprocity in economic decision making but no studies have been focused on the effect of communication on affective states in such a context. Thanks to advanced methods of computational psychometrics, in this study, affective states were deeply examined using simultaneous and synchronized recordings of gazes and psychophysiological signals in 28 female students during an investment game. Results showed that participants experienced different affective states according to the type of communication (personal versus impersonal). In particular, participants involved in personal communication felt more relaxed than participants involved in impersonal communication. Moreover, personal communication influenced reciprocity and participants' perceptions about trust and reciprocity. Findings were interpreted in the light of the Arousal/Valence Model and self-disclosure process.",1
"Alcohol abuse is a worldwide health problem with high economic costs to health systems. Emerging evidence suggests that modulation of brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) may be a therapeutic target for alcohol dependence. In this work, we assess the effectiveness of four doses of erysodine  (1.5, 2.0, 4.0 or 8.0 mg/kg/day, i.p.), a competitive antagonist of nAChRs, on voluntary ethanol consumption behavior in alcohol-preferring UChB rats, administered during three consecutive days. Results show that erysodine administration produces a dose-dependent reduction in ethanol consumption respect to saline injection (control group). The highest doses of erysodine (4 and 8 mg/kg) reduce (45 and 66%, respectively) the ethanol intake during treatment period and first day of post-treatment compared to control group. While, the lowest doses of erysodine (1.5 and 2 mg/kg) only reduce ethanol intake during one day of treatment period. These effective reductions in ethanol intake were 23 and 29% for 1.5 and 2 mg/kg erysodine, respectively. Locomotor activity induced by a  high dose of erysodine (10 mg/kg) was similar to those observed with saline injection in control rats, showing that the reduction in ethanol intake was not produced by hypolocomotor effect induced by erysodine. This is the first report showing that erysodine reduces ethanol intake in UChB rats in a dose-dependent manner. Our results highlight the role of nAChRs in the reward effects of ethanol and its modulation as a potentially effective pharmacological alternative for alcohol dependence treatment.",0
"Although dreaming is a private experience, dream sharing is a common experience for most people. Dreams are disclosed to romantic partners, friends, and relatives, and the sharing is often associated with enhancement of relational intimacy and stress relief (e.g., in the case of nightmares). Research has focused on factors that might affect dream sharing such as dream recall frequency, gender, and emotional intensity of the dream. The present findings indicate that about 14.5% of the dreams were shared and that dream recall frequency, nightmare frequency, attitude toward dreams, gender, extroversion, and thin boundaries are associated independently with the frequency of dream sharing. Longitudinal studies are needed to differentiate between state factors and trait  factors and to validate the self-reported positive effects of dream sharing on intimacy in romantic relationships and friendships.",0
"Compared to standard laboratory protocols, the measurement of psychophysiological signals in real world experiments poses technical and methodological challenges due to external factors that cannot be directly controlled. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid approach based on an immersive and human accessible space called the eXperience Induction Machine (XIM), that incorporates the advantages of a laboratory within a life-like setting. The XIM integrates unobtrusive wearable sensors for the acquisition of psychophysiological signals suitable for ambulatory emotion research. In this paper, we present results from two different studies conducted to validate the XIM as a general-purpose sensing infrastructure for the study of human affective states under ecologically valid conditions. In the first investigation, we recorded and classified signals from subjects exposed to pictorial stimuli corresponding to a range of arousal levels, while they were free to walk and gesticulate. In the second study, we designed an experiment that follows the classical conditioning paradigm, a well-known procedure in the behavioral sciences, with the additional feature that participants were free to move in the physical space, as opposed to similar studies measuring physiological signals in constrained laboratory settings. Our results indicate that, by using our sensing infrastructure, it is indeed possible to infer human event-elicited affective states through measurements of psychophysiological signals under ecological conditions.",1
"This study examined a two-dimensional approach to assessing affective states among good and poor sleepers using the self-assessment manikin (SAM), a brief non-verbal self-report measure of affective states with separate ratings of valence and arousal. A sample of 286 undergraduate students completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the SAM. Participants were classified post hoc as either good (PSQI </= 5) or poor sleepers (PSQI > 5) using the PSQI and used the SAM to rate their current affective states (day) and their affective state at bedtime (night) the previous night. Compared to good sleepers, poor sleepers reported more negative affect and arousal at night and more negative affect during the day. Among poor sleepers, lower sleep quality and shorter sleep duration on the components of the PSQI were associated with more negative daytime valence. Among good sleepers, higher scores on the sleep medication and daytime dysfunction components of the PSQI were associated with more negative daytime valence. These findings indicate that the SAM appears to detect differences between good and poor sleepers on both valence and arousal of current daytime and retrospective night-time emotional states. This approach could be useful for the assessment of affective states related to sleep disturbance.",1
"Although interest in mental health promotion has recently been increasing, the most appropriate approaches remain to be determined. Therefore we conducted Stress Management Classes (SMCs) at Higashi Osaka City Naka Health Center in an attempt to help residents to improve their mental health. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of SMCs, held four times over 2 months, with an educational program including the concept of stress and instruction in autogenic training as a relaxation technique. Subjects who attended a Health Promotion Class (HPC) at Osaka Prefectural Kaizuka Health Center were used as controls for the study. The aim of the HPC was to prevent chronic physical diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, with the program consisting mainly of exercise once a week for 3 months. The results were as follows: 1) People who attended SMCs were more likely to have mental health problems than those who attended the HPC. As a result, mentally ill patients could be diagnosed and receive psychiatric treatment at an early stage in the SMC group. 2) Both SMC and HPC attenders reported improvement of their mental health  status with the use of POMS (Profile of Mood States). 3) Both SMC and HPC attenders exhibited significant decrease of blood pressure. Although attenders of both classes improved their mental health status, it is important to be able to attract individuals who are in a poor mental condition in case of mental health promotion. In this trial, we found that the term ""stress management"" was very useful because people who suffered stress were likely to be interested in it. After the Community Health Law was established in 1994, the flow of community health activities has been shifting from the prefectural government to the municipality. However, promoting mental health and welfare is still mainly the role of the prefectural government. In this sense, health centers are appropriate institutions to hold classes as in this trial.",0
"BACKGROUND: A growing body of research shows that diet quality and physical activity (PA) are associated with health-related quality of life (HRQOL). However, no study to date has assessed this association using the Healthy Eating  Index-2015 as a measure of diet quality. Furthermore, few studies have examined the association between PA dose and HRQOL among a nationally representative sample of older adults. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between diet quality, physical activity, and HRQOL. DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data obtained from 5,311 adults aged 60+ years who took part in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2007 and 2014. MEASUREMENTS: HRQOL was assessed by general health status, and number of physically unhealthy days, mentally unhealthy days, and inactive days in past 30  days. Diet quality was assessed by the Healthy Eating Index-2015 using data generated by two 24-hour dietary recalls. PA was measured by the Global Physical  Activity Questionnaire. Multivariate logistic/or linear regression models were used to examine the association between diet quality, PA and HRQOL controlling for confounders and accounting for complex sampling. RESULTS: Approximately half of the participants (55.2%) were women, 45.1% met current PA recommendations, 65% had less healthful diets according to the Healthy Eating Index-2015. Diet quality was associated with HROQL. For every 1-point diet quality score increase, the likelihood of respondents rating their general health as being excellent/good increased by 3% (OR=1.03, 95%CI: 1.02, 1.04), and number  of inactive days (β =-0.03, 95%CI: -0.05, 0.00) and mental unhealthy days (β =-0.03, 95%CI: -0.05, -0.01) declined by 0.03 days. PA was associated with all HROQL measures and respondents with high PA levels reported better general health (OR=3.53, 95%CI: 2.69, 4.63), fewer inactive days (β =-1.53, 95%CI: -2.11, -0.95), fewer physical unhealthy days (β =-1.88, 95%CI: -2.74, -1.02) than individuals with low PA levels but not fewer mentally unhealthy days. CONCLUSIONS: Among older adults in this study, eating a healthier diet and being  physically active were associated with better general health and reporting fewer  physical unhealthy days and inactive days. Study results provide valuable information that could inform policies, programs and interventions designed to improve HRQOL in older adults and reduce potentially preventable health disparities.",0
"OBJECTIVE: We examined symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) personnel who provided law enforcement and relief services to affected communities following Hurricane Katrina. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of mental health outcomes related  to personal and work-related exposures of police personnel 8 weeks after the Hurricane. RESULTS: Of the 912 police personnel who completed the questionnaire, 227 (26%) reported symptoms consistent with depression and 170 (19%) reported symptoms consistent with PTSD. Risk factors associated with PTSD include recovery of bodies, crowd control, assault, and injury to a family member. Depressive symptoms were associated with rare family contact, uninhabitable home, isolation  from the NOPD, assault, and injury to a family member. CONCLUSIONS: Police personnel reported symptoms of PTSD and depression associated with work-related and personal factors following Hurricane Katrina.",0
"BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that older adults show positive affects after participating in exercise bouts. However, it is less clear, if and how physical activities in daily living enhance affective states, too. This is dissatisfying, as most of older adults' physical activities are part of their daily living. To answer these questions we used activity-triggered e-diaries to investigate the within-subject effects of physical activity on three dimensions of affective states (valence, energetic arousal, calmness) during everyday life. METHODS: Older adults (N = 74) between 50 and 70 years took part in the study during three consecutive days. Physical activity in daily living was objectively assessed using accelerometers. Affects were measured 10 min after a study participant surpassed a predefined threshold for activity or inactivity. The participants were prompted by an acoustic signal to assess their momentary affective states on an e-diary. Data were analyzed with hierarchical multilevel analyses. RESULTS: Whenever older individuals were more physically active, they felt more energized (energetic arousal) and agitated (calmness). However, they did not feel better (valence). Interestingly, body mass index (BMI) and valence were associated in a significant cross-level interaction. BMI acts as a moderating variable in the way that lower BMI scores were associated with higher levels of valence scores after being physically active. CONCLUSIONS: The innovative ambulatory assessment used here affords an interesting insight to the affective effects of daily activity of older adults. These effects are no simple and no linear ones, i.e. physical activity is not associated with positive affects per se as shown several times in experimental studies with single activity bouts. Rather there is a differentiating association seen as an enhanced feeling of energy and agitation, which is not accompanied by a better feeling. Socio-emotional selectivity theory may support the finding that older individuals are emotionally more stable during their day-to-day life, which might explain the non-significant effect on the affect dimension valence.",1
"Several interventions aiming to enhance physical activity in everyday life showed mixed effects. Affective constructs are thought to potentially support health behavior change. However, little is known about within-subject associations between momentary affect and subsequent physical activity in everyday life. This study analyzed the extent to which three dimensions of affective states (valence, calmness, and energetic arousal) were associated with different components of daily activity trajectories. Sixty-five undergraduates' students (Age: M = 24.6; SD = 3.2; females: 57%) participated in this study. Physical activity was assessed objectively through accelerometers during 24 h. Affective states assessments were conducted randomly every 45 min using an e-diary with a six-item mood scale that was especially designed for ambulatory assessment. We conducted three-level multi-level analyses to investigate the extent to which momentary affect accounted for momentary volume, prospective trends, and stability vs. fluctuation of physical activity in everyday life. All three affect dimensions were significantly associated with momentary activity volumes and prospective trends over 45 min periods. Physical activity didn't fluctuate freely, but featured significant autocorrelation across repeated measurements, suggesting some stability of physical activity across 5-min assessments. After adjusting for the autoregressive structure in physical activity assessments, only energetic arousal remained a significant predictor. Feeling energized and awake was associated with an increased momentary volume of activity and initially smaller but gradually growing decreases in subsequent activity within the subsequent 45 min. Although not related to trends in physical activity, higher valence predicted lower stability in physical activity across subsequent 45 min, suggesting more short-term fluctuations in daily activity the more participants reported positive affective valence. The current analyses afford interesting insight into within-subject associations between momentary affect and activity-trajectories in everyday life. Energetic arousal emerged as the only meaningful predictor of physical activity in daily life after adjusting for autoregression. A significant effect of valence on short-term activity fluctuations might indicate that activity interventions would benefit from taking into account enhancement of positive affective valence in everyday life. Moments of enhanced valence may scaffold attempts helping inactive people to get started with daily activities and overcome periods of inactivity in everyday life.",1
"Previous research suggests that neural and behavioral responses to surprised faces are modulated by explicit contexts (e.g., ""He just found $500""). Here, we examined the effect of implicit contexts (i.e., valence of other frequently presented faces) on both valence ratings and ability to detect surprised faces (i.e., the infrequent target). In Experiment 1, we demonstrate that participants  interpret surprised faces more positively when they are presented within a context of happy faces, as compared to a context of angry faces. In Experiments 2 and 3, we used the oddball paradigm to evaluate the effects of clearly valenced facial expressions (i.e., happy and angry) on default valence interpretations of  surprised faces. We offer evidence that the default interpretation of surprise is negative, as participants were faster to detect surprised faces when presented within a happy context (Exp. 2). Finally, we kept the valence of the contexts constant (i.e., surprised faces) and showed that participants were faster to detect happy than angry faces (Exp. 3). Together, these experiments demonstrate the utility of the oddball paradigm to explore the default valence interpretation of presented facial expressions, particularly the ambiguously valenced facial expression of surprise.",0
"RATIONALE: Drug reward plays a central role in acquiring drug-seeking behavior. However, subjects may continue using drugs despite negative consequences because  self-administration becomes habitual, and divorced from outcome values. Although  a history of drug and alcohol use expedite habit acquisition, and in spite of the fact that self-administration leads to intoxication, the acute effects of drugs on habitual responding are not well understood. OBJECTIVES: We sought to observe how acute ethanol and amphetamine affect the balance between habitual and goal-directed behavior, as measured by a fluid-reinforced operant conditioning task. METHODS: Selectively bred crossed high-alcohol-preferring (cHAP) mice were trained on an operant conditioning task reinforced on a variable interval schedule with 1% banana solution, which was subsequently devalued via LiCl pairing in half the animals. Ethanol (1.0 g/kg), amphetamine (2.0 mg/kg), or saline was administered prior to a post-devaluation test. RESULTS: Overall, mice showed habitual behavior, but when divided into high- or low-responding groups based on training response rates, saline-treated, low-responding animals devalued, while saline-treated high-responding animals did not. Furthermore, amphetamine elicited devaluation even in high-responding animals, while ethanol prevented devaluation even in low-responding animals. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that ethanol shifts animals toward behaving habitually. This may illuminate why alcohol-intoxicated individuals display impaired judgment about the relative merits of drinking, and potentially serve as a mechanism by which intoxicated subjects resume previously devalued behaviors, such as comorbid drug use. These findings also show that high variable interval response rates facilitate a shift from goal-directed to habitual behavior.",0
"BACKGROUND: This study examined the factors associated with body mass index (BMI) categories of Malaysian adolescents by physical activity (PA) status. METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2012 Malaysia Global School-based Student Health Survey. Generalized ordered logit regression analysis was conducted on 24  339 adolescents by PA status. RESULTS: Early- (ages 11-13) and middle-stage (ages 14-16) adolescents were associated with higher overweight and obesity risks than their older peers (ages  17-18). Male adolescents faced higher underweight and obesity likelihoods than females. Hunger due to food shortage at home was associated with higher likelihoods of underweight and normal weight BMI categories. Smokers were more likely to be underweight or normal weight than non-smokers. Segmented-sample analysis by PA status indicated that, while the direction of associations was parallel across PA status, the magnitudes of association between age, hunger and  smoking status with BMI status were greater among active than inactive adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Male adolescents faced a dual burden of underweight and obesity. Other sociodemographic and dietary-lifestyle factors were associated with adolescent BMI categories. Segmented-sample analysis by PA status uncovered varying associations between factors that would otherwise be masked in pooled sample analysis. Public health authorities should take these factors into consideration when deliberating programs to ensure healthy adolescent body weight.",0
"Recent literature has raised concerns regarding the risk of adverse psychiatric events among bariatric surgery patients. However, the relationship between weight loss therapy and psychiatric outcomes is confounded by baseline psychosocial characteristics in observational studies. To understand the impact of bariatric surgery on the risk of adverse mental health outcomes, we conducted a systematic  review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared surgical and non-surgical treatments and assessed mental health quality of life (QoL). We  evaluated the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science PsycINFO, Clinicaltrials.gov and Cochrane databases through 7 March 2018. Pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) for mental health QoL scores were estimated using random effects models. Eleven randomized trials with 731 participants were included in the final analyses. Surgery was not associated with an improvement in mental health QoL from baseline as compared to non-surgical intervention (SMD: 0.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.22 to 0.25). Final mental health QoL scores were similar for surgically and non-surgically treated patients (SMD: 0.37, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.81). Subgroup analyses assessing the effect of specific surgical interventions, and varying lengths of follow-up did not identify a beneficial effect of bariatric surgery on mental health QoL outcomes. These results, in conjunction with the fact that individuals who choose bariatric surgery tend to have high-risk baseline characteristics, suggest that intensive mental health follow-up following surgery should be routinely considered.",0
"Regularly conducted exercise programs effectively influence affective states. Studies suggest that this is also true for short bouts of physical activity (PA) of 10 min or less. Accordingly, everyday life activities of short duration might be used to regulate affective states. However, this association has rarely been studied in reference to unstructured activities in ongoing real-life situations. The current study examined the influence of various everyday life activities on three dimensions of mood (valence, calmness, energetic arousal) in a predominantly inactive sample. Ambulatory Assessment (AA) was used to investigate the association between actual PA and affective states during the course of 1 day. Seventy-seven students ages 19-30 participated in the study. PA was assessed with accelerometers, and affective state assessments were conducted hourly using an e-diary with a six-item mood scale that was specially designed for AA. Multilevel analyses indicated that the mood dimensions energetic arousal (p = 0.001) and valence (p = 0.005) were positively influenced by the intensity of the activity carried out in the 10-min prior to the assessment. As their activity increased, the participants' positive feelings and energetic arousal increased. However, the students' calmness was not affected by their activity levels. The findings highlight the importance of integrating short activity intervals of 10 min or less into everyday life routines to improve affective states.",1
"There is a growing focus on child wellbeing and happiness in schools, but we lack self-report measures for very young children. Three samples ( N = 2345) were combined to assess the psychometric properties of the How I Feel About My School  (HIFAMS) questionnaire, which was designed for children aged 4-8 years. Test-retest reliability was moderate (intraclass correlation coefficient = .62).  HIFAMS assessed a single concept and had moderate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha values from .62 to .67). There were low correlations between scores on the child-reported HIFAMS and parent and teacher reports. Children at risk of exclusion had significantly lower HIFAMS scores than the community sample (mean difference = 2.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) = [1.6, 3.2]; p < .001). Schools contributed only 4.5% of the variability in HIFAMS score, the remaining 95.5% reflecting pupil differences within schools. Girls' scores were 0.37 units  (95% CI = [0.16, 0.57]; p < .001) higher than boys, while year group and deprivation did not predict HIFAMS score. HIFAMS is a promising measure that demonstrates moderate reliability and discriminates between groups even among very young children.",0
"BACKGROUND: Uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is high overall but  there are disparities in uptake, particularly by ethnicity. Incentivising vaccination consent form return is a promising approach to increase vaccination uptake. As part of a randomised feasibility trial we qualitatively assessed the acceptability of increasing uptake of HPV vaccination by incentivising consent form return. METHODS: In the context of a two-arm, cluster randomised feasibility trial, qualitative free-text questionnaire responses were collected from adolescent girls (n = 181) and their parents (n = 61), assessing the acceptability of an incentive intervention to increase HPV vaccination consent form return. In the incentive intervention arm, girls who returned a signed consent form (regardless  of whether consent was given or refused), had a 1-in-10 chance of winning a £50 shopping voucher. Telephone interviews were also conducted with members of staff  from participating schools (n = 6), assessing the acceptability of the incentive. Data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Girls and parents provided a mix of positive, negative and ambivalent responses about the use of the incentive to encourage HPV vaccination consent form return. Both girls and parents held misconceptions about the nature of the incentive, wrongly believing that the incentive was dependent on vaccination receipt rather than consent form return. School staff members also expressed a mix of opinions on the acceptability of the incentive, including perceptions of effectiveness and ethics. CONCLUSIONS: The use of an incentive intervention to encourage the return of HPV  vaccination consent forms was found to be moderately acceptable to those receiving and delivering the intervention, although a number of changes are required to improve this. In particular, improving communication about the nature of the incentive to reduce misconceptions is vital. These findings suggest that incentivising consent form return may be an acceptable means of improving HPV vaccination rates, should improvements be made.

"From direct observations, facial, vocal, gestural, physiological, and central nervous signals, estimating human affective states through computational models such as multivariate linear-regression analysis, support vector regression, and artificial neural network, have been proposed in the past decade. In these models, linear models are generally lack of precision because of ignoring intrinsic nonlinearities of complex psychophysiological processes; and nonlinear models commonly adopt complicated algorithms. To improve accuracy and simplify model, we introduce a new computational modeling method named as higher-order multivariable polynomial regression to estimate human affective states. The study employs standardized pictures in the International Affective Picture System to induce thirty subjects' affective states, and obtains pure affective patterns of skin conductance as input variables to the higher-order multivariable polynomial model for predicting affective valence and arousal. Experimental results show that our method is able to obtain efficient correlation coefficients of 0.98 and 0.96 for estimation of affective valence and arousal, respectively. Moreover, the method may provide certain indirect evidences that valence and arousal have their brain's motivational circuit origins. Thus, the proposed method can serve as a novel one for efficiently estimating human affective states.",1
"INTRODUCTION: Women with gestational diabetes are at 7 times greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes than are women without gestational diabetes. The objectives of this study were to examine recent changes in the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus among women of reproductive age in the United States and assess the prevalence of factors associated with participating in healthy lifestyle behaviors. METHODS: Data were from 4 waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination  Survey (2007-2014). Gestational diabetes was identified by participants' response to whether they were ever told by a health care professional that they had diabetes during pregnancy. The health behaviors were participation in physical activity, healthy dietary patterns (intake of cholesterol, sodium, and fiber within recommended guidelines), and smoking. The analytical sample included 3,034 women aged 20 to 44 years. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association between gestational diabetes and health behaviors. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of gestational diabetes was 8.9% (95% confidence  interval [CI], 7.6%-10.4%) during 2007-2014. The prevalence increased from 8.4% in 2007-2008 to 10.4% in 2013-2014, an increase of 24%, but the change was not significant (P = .28). The proportions of women meeting recommended guidelines for the health behaviors did not change significantly. We found no significant difference in practicing healthy behaviors between women with gestational diabetes and women without gestational diabetes. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of gestational diabetes increased slightly in recent years, and women with the condition were generally not meeting guidelines for healthy behaviors. Coordinated interventions are needed to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors among women with gestational diabetes because they are at increased risk for diabetes.",0
"Mothers and their babies represent one of the closest dyadic units and thus provide a powerful paradigm to examine how affective states are shared, and result in, synchronized physiologic responses between two people. We recruited mothers and their 12- to 14-month-old infants (Ndyads = 98) to complete a lab study in which mothers were initially separated from their infants and assigned to either a low-arousal positive/relaxation condition, intended to elicit parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) reactivity, or a high-arousal negative/stress task, intended to elicit sympathetic nervous system (SNS) reactivity. Upon reunion, infants were placed either on their mothers' laps (touch condition) or in a high chair next to the mother (no-touch condition). We then examined if the babies SNS and/or PNS responses changed from their baseline levels and how the dyads' physiological responses-both PNS and SNS responses-synchronized over time as a function of mothers' affect manipulation and touch condition. Three noteworthy findings were observed. First, infants of mothers assigned to the relaxation task showed greater PNS increases and PNS covariation. Second, infants of mothers assigned to the stress task showed stronger SNS covariation with their mothers over time. Finally, infants who sat on their mothers' laps (i.e., touch condition) showed stronger SNS covariation than those in the no-touch condition. Taken together, these results suggest that mothers' affective states-low-arousal positive states as well as high-arousal negative states-can be ""caught"" by their infants, and that touch can play a critical role in stress contagion.

"Adolescence is a sensitive period for changes in both sleep and affect. Although past research has assessed the association between affect and sleep among adolescents, few studies have examined both trait (typical) and day-to-day changes in affect, and fewer still have specifically examined negative social evaluative emotions (e.g. embarrassment) in relation to sleep. Both between- and within-person variations in daily affect were examined in relation to four objectively-measured sleep outcomes (sleep hours; sleep latency; sleep efficiency; and length of wake bouts) among adolescents. Participants (N = 77 high-school students; 42.9% female; M = 14.37 years) wore an actiwatch and completed daily-diaries for 3 days. The results of hierarchical linear models (controlling for age, gender, race, ethnicity, parental employment status, income, puberty and caffeine) indicated that negative social evaluative emotions and high-arousal affective experiences generally predicted poor sleep outcomes, whereas low-arousal affective experiences were associated with good sleep outcomes. Specifically, at the person level, adolescents reporting higher negative social evaluative emotions had shorter average sleep hours, and those experiencing higher anxiety-nervousness had longer wake bouts. In addition, individuals experiencing more dysphoria (sad, depressed, lonely) had longer average sleep hours and shorter wake bouts, while those experiencing more calmness had shorter sleep latencies. At the within-person level, individuals had longer sleep latencies following days that they had experienced high-arousal positive affect (e.g. excitement), and had longer wake bouts following days they had experienced more negative social evaluative emotions. The results highlight the detrimental effects of negative social evaluative emotions and high-arousal affective states for adolescent sleep.",1
"Positive affect has long been considered a hallmark of subjective happiness. Yet, high levels of positive affect have also been linked with hypomania risk: a set of cognitive, affective, and behavioral characteristics that constitute a dispositional risk for future episodes of hypomania and mania. At a personality level, two powerful predictors of affective experience are extraversion and neuroticism: extraversion has been linked to positive affect, and neuroticism to  negative affect. As such, a single personality trait--extraversion--has been linked to both beneficial and harmful outcomes associated with positivity. It is  clear that positive affect, in different forms, has divergent consequences for well-being, but previous research has struggled to articulate the nature of these differences. We suggest that the relationship between affect and well-being needs to be situated within the psychological context of the individual--both in terms  of more specific forms of extraversion and neuroticism, but also in terms of interactions among personality aspects. Consistent with this idea, we found that  two aspects of extraversion (enthusiasm and assertiveness) differentially predicted subjective happiness from hypomania risk and two aspects of neuroticism (volatility and withdrawal) interacted to predict hypomania risk: the highest levels of hypomania risk were associated with the combination of high volatility  and low withdrawal. These findings underscore the importance of examining personality at the right level of resolution to understand well-being and dysfunction.",0
"CONTEXT: Suryanamaskar is a yogic practice widely practiced across India. Along with the available studies on physiology, there is a need to study its psychological effects. AIMS: This research aims at studying the effects of suryanamaskar on relaxation dispositions (R-dispositions) among college students with high stress in Pune, India. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The present study was conducted in a college setting and used a randomized control group design. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A group of 419 college students (age 17-22 years) were assessed on stress symptoms using the ABC relaxation theory. A total of 124 out of 419 students who were identified as high on stress were randomly assigned to an experimental and control group. And 40 participants each in both the group completed the program and were assessed on R-dispositions and stress dispositions before and after the suryanamaskar program. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to study the  differences in R-dispositions and stress dispositions between the experimental and control groups. RESULTS: The experimental group was found to be higher on the R-dispositions of physical relaxation, mental quiet, at ease/peace, rested and refreshed, strength  and awareness and joy and lower on sleepiness, and stress dispositions-somatic stress, worry, and negative emotion compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that suryanamaskar is effective in leading to R-Dispositions like physical relaxation, mental quiet, at ease/peace, rested and  refreshed, strength and awareness and joy and reduces sleepiness, somatic stress, worry and negative emotion at a dispositional level.",0
"Recent research has demonstrated that affective states elicited by viewing pictures varying in valence and arousal are identifiable from whole brain activation patterns observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Identification of affective states from more naturalistic stimuli has clinical relevance, but the feasibility of identifying these states on an individual trial basis from fMRI data elicited by dynamic multimodal stimuli is unclear. The goal of this study was to determine whether affective states can be similarly identified when participants view dynamic naturalistic audiovisual stimuli. Eleven participants viewed 5s audiovisual clips in a passive viewing task in the scanner. Valence and arousal for individual trials were identified both within and across participants based on distributed patterns of activity in areas selectively responsive to audiovisual naturalistic stimuli while controlling for lower level features of the stimuli. In addition, the brain regions identified by searchlight analyses to represent valence and arousal were consistent with previously identified regions associated with emotion processing. These findings extend previous results on the distributed representation of affect to multimodal dynamic stimuli.",1
"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of a 4-month concurrent exercise training program on cardiometabolic status in perimenopausal  women. METHODS: The participants (n = 150) were randomized into counseling (n = 75) and  exercise (n = 75) groups. The exercise group followed 4-month (3 days/week, 60 min/session) concurrent training. The counseling group attended conferences on a healthy lifestyle. We determined plasma glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides, and C-reactive protein, and measured blood pressure and the resting heart rate. RESULTS: In the per-protocol analyses, the exercise group showed lower LDL-C concentrations than the counseling group when the model was further adjusted for  the baseline values and diet (10.2 mg/dl; 95% confidence interval -19.4, -0.96; p = 0.031). Borderline significant total cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure were reduced in both groups with better results in exercise group (p = 0.068 and  p = 0.090, respectively). CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that the concurrent exercise training program could improve plasma glucose, lipid profile, CRP, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the exercise group. These results also suggest the importance of a healthy diet and active behavior during menopause, as improvements in both the exercise and the counseling group were observed. Future  analysis should combine both interventions in search of better results.",0
"BACKGROUND: Mental problems are highly common among the general population. Mind-body interventions were found to be highly effective in treating them. The current study assessed the effect of Inquiry-Based Stress Reduction (IBSR) meditation on psychological parameters in a general population sample. METHODS: Ninety-seven Participants enrolled in a 28-day workshop and completed a  set of self-administered measures before and after the workshop. Outcome measures included Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomology-Self Report (QIDS-SR16), Outcome Questionnaire OQ-45.2, The Quality  of Life Inventory (QOLI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form (STAI), State-Trait  Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) (State), Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS), Eating Attitudes Test (EAT). RESULTS: BDI scale decreased significantly before and after the intervention. QIDS scale improved significantly from T1 to T2 (p < 0.001). Outcome questionnaire decreased significantly at T2. Quality of life scores improved significantly between T1 and T2 (p < 0.001). Anxiety state and trait scores decreased significantly after the intervention (p < 0.001) All the subscales of anger decreased significantly after the intervention (p < 0.001).Subjective happiness improved significantly (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: IBSR meditation improved various psychological scales among a general population sample. Further controlled studies should evaluate the clinical implementation of IBSR among the general population.",0
"INTRODUCTION: Persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) is a relatively unknown clinical condition affecting several women. Moral standards, as well as conservative beliefs regarding sexuality, are believed to be involved in the etiology and maintenance of this syndrome. Nevertheless, there are no consistent data on the content of the beliefs system presented by these women. AIM: The aim of this study was to characterize the cognitive and emotional style of women reporting PGAD. More precisely, the content of sexual beliefs, thoughts, and emotions during sexual intercourse was explored. METHODS: Forty-three women presenting PGAD and 42 controls responded to a web survey. This study was cross-cultural in nature and women worldwide (over 18 years old) were asked to participate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants answered the following online questionnaires: Sexual Dysfunctional Beliefs Questionnaire, Sexual Modes Questionnaire, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and Brief Symptom Inventory. Additionally, participants responded to a checklist assessing the presence and frequency of PGAD symptoms. RESULTS: After controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and psychopathology, findings showed that women reporting PGAD symptoms presented significantly more dysfunctional sexual beliefs (e.g., sexual conservatism, sexual desire as a sin), as well as more negative thoughts (e.g., thoughts of sexual abuse and of lack of partner's affection) and dysfunctional affective states (more negative and less positive affect) during sexual activity than non-PGAD women. CONCLUSIONS: Notwithstanding the impact of neurophysiological determinants in the etiology of this syndrome, results support the psychological conceptualization of PGAD and highlight the role of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for PGAD symptomatology. More specifically, cognitive and behavioral strategies would be aimed at targeting maladaptive sexual beliefs and thoughts, as well as regulating negative affective states resulting from a dysfunctional cognitive style regarding sexuality. In all, CBT in association with a medical/pharmacological approach, could be clinically relevant in the management of PGAD.",1
"When making choices, collecting more information is beneficial but comes at the cost of sacrificing time that could be allocated to making other potentially rewarding decisions. To investigate how the brain balances these costs and benefits, we conducted a series of novel experiments in humans and simulated various computational models. Under six levels of time pressure, subjects made decisions either by integrating sensory information over time or by dynamically combining sensory and reward information over time. We found that during sensory  integration, time pressure reduced performance as the deadline approached, and choice was more strongly influenced by the most recent sensory evidence. By fitting performance and reaction time with various models we found that our experimental results are more compatible with leaky integration of sensory information with an urgency signal or a decision process based on stochastic transitions between discrete states modulated by an urgency signal. When combining sensory and reward information, subjects spent less time on integration than optimally prescribed when reward decreased slowly over time, and the most recent evidence did not have the maximal influence on choice. The suboptimal pattern of reaction time was partially mitigated in an equivalent control experiment in which sensory integration over time was not required, indicating that the suboptimal response time was influenced by the perception of imperfect sensory integration. Meanwhile, during combination of sensory and reward information, performance did not drop as the deadline approached, and response time was not different between correct and incorrect trials. These results indicate a decision process different from what is involved in the integration of sensory information over time. Together, our results not only reveal limitations  in sensory integration over time but also illustrate how these limitations influence dynamic combination of sensory and reward information.",0
"Aaron T. Beck describes habitual patterns of schemas (ie, organized patterns of thought or behavior) as vital elements of emotional and behavioral experience, whereas biased processing of information accompanies psychopathological states. In this article, the authors propose a hypothetico-integrative approach to understanding the role of yoga and meditation. This approach is based on the background of Beck's model of the psychopathology of the dysfunctional self. The  authors have found that the practices common to most forms of yoga and meditation are (1) focusing of attention; (2) creating a state of relaxation; and (3) developing mindfulness through efferent attenuation, sensory attenuation, and nonanalytic attention. Biological studies of meditation and yoga have found a tendency toward use of the relaxation response, the involvement of the attentional networks, and, likely, the cingulatecortex, particularly in the process of bare attention (ie, awareness without thought). This highest level of  nonjudgmental awareness may help in obtaining a better-adjusted resilient self.",0
"The causal relationship between serum ferritin and metabolic syndrome (MetS) remains inconclusive. Dietary iron intake increases serum ferritin. The objective of this study was to evaluate associations of total, heme, and nonheme dietary iron intake with MetS and its components in men and women in metropolitan China.  Data from 3099 participants in the Shanghai Diet and Health Survey (SDHS) obtained during 2012⁻2013 were included in this analysis. Dietary intake was assessed by 24-h diet records from 3 consecutive days. Multivariate generalized linear mixed models were used to evaluate the associations of dietary iron intake with MetS and its components. After adjustment for potential confounders as age,  sex, income, physical exercise, smoking status, alcohol use, and energy intake, a positive trend was observed across quartiles of total iron intake and risk of MetS (p for trend = 0.022). Compared with the lowest quartile of total iron intake (<12.72 mg/day), the highest quartile (≥21.88 mg/day) had an odds ratio (95% confidence interval), OR (95% CI), of 1.59 (1.15,2.20). In addition, the highest quartile of nonheme iron intake (≥20.10 mg/day) had a 1.44-fold higher risk of MetS compared with the lowest quartile (<11.62 mg/day), and higher risks  of MetS components were associated with the third quartiles of total and nonheme  iron intake. There was no association between heme iron intake and risk of MetS (p for trend = 0.895). Associations for total and nonheme iron intake with MetS risk were found in men but not in women. Total and nonheme dietary iron intake was found to be positively associated with MetS and its components in the adult population in metropolitan China. This research also revealed a gender difference in the association between dietary iron intake and MetS.",0
"BACKGROUND: Functional hemispherectomy (FH) is mainly performed in children with  catastrophic epilepsies and pre-existing severe hemiparesis. It is accepted that  mainly patients at young ages with more or less complete loss of their hand function are suitable candidates for FH. However, we feel that FH should be considered also in some adults with devastating unilateral epilepsy syndromes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report four cases of adults who underwent FH because of  their intractable epilepsy syndromes. Three of the four patients had reduced but  not complete loss of hand function. Careful weighing-up of the risk-benefit ratio still led to the decision to perform FH in order to achieve complete seizure relief. RESULTS: All patients had a surgical outcome of Engel class I; one of them suffered from post-operative psychogenic non-epileptic seizures which were treated successfully by psychotherapy. No clinically relevant complications occurred. CONCLUSION: We wish to point out that FH is a possible surgical option in cases with catastrophic epilepsies in adulthood. Patients and relatives should strongly consider that the likelihood of at least partially, impaired hand function or other surgery-related additional handicaps may be outweighed by the chance of freedom of seizures in a limited number of patients. In all of our cases, patients and relatives agreed that the surgical outcome led to a marked improvement of quality of life and that it had been the right decision to proceed with FH in spite of the expected negative impacts of the operation. Video examples of the pre- and post-surgical hand function of one sample patient are enclosed.",0
"Animal training relies heavily on an understanding of species-specific behaviour as it integrates with operant conditioning principles. Following on from recent studies showing that affective states and arousal levels may correlate with behavioural outcomes, we explore the contribution of both affective state and arousal in behavioural responses to operant conditioning. This paper provides a framework for assessing how affective state and arousal may influence the efficacy of operant training methods. It provides a series of three-dimensional conceptual graphs as exemplars to describing putative influences of both affective state and arousal on the likelihood of dogs and horses performing commonly desired behaviours. These graphs are referred to as response landscapes, and they highlight the flexibility available for improving training efficacy and the likely need for different approaches to suit animals in different affective states and at various levels of arousal. Knowledge gaps are discussed and suggestions made for bridging them.",1
"Playfulness has been referred to as a disposition that involves reframing a situation to amuse others and to make the situation more stimulating and enjoyable. It may serve to shift one's perspective when dealing with environmental threats. Despite all the benefits of playfulness towards psychological well-being, it remains a largely understudied subject in psychology, particularly in Chinese societies. Hence, this study examined the association between adult playfulness, humor styles, and subjective happiness among a sample of 166 university students in Hong Kong and 159 students in Guangzhou, who completed a self-administered questionnaire, including the Short Measure for Adult Playfulness, the Chinese Humor Styles Questionnaire, and the Subjective Happiness Scale. Results showed that adult playfulness was positively  correlated with affiliative humor, self-enhancing humor, and subjective happiness in both Hong Kong and Guangzhou samples. By its implication, highly playful Chinese students preferred using affiliative and self-enhancing humor to amuse themselves and others.",0
"Phan et al. (2008) recently reported that an acute dose of oral THC is associated with a decrease in threat-related amygdala reactivity during a social threat stimulus task. However, to date, those findings have not been replicated, and have not been extended to clinical studies involving smoked rather than oral cannabis. In this study, we hypothesized that level of cannabis smoked by participants in our treatment study would be inversely related to the level of threat-related amygdala reactivity. Subjects were recruited from among participants in our double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of fluoxetine in comorbid youth with cannabis dependence/major depression. The threat-related amygdala reactivity task used by Hariri et al. (2009) was completed during BOLD fMRI scans at study baseline and then again 12 weeks later at the end of the trial. Data are available from six subjects with pre-and post-treatment fMRI data. During the course of the study, five of the six subjects demonstrated a decrease in their level of cannabis use, with a mean decrease of 64%, and those persons all demonstrated an increase in their level of amygdala reactivity. One subject demonstrated an increase in their level of cannabis use (a 79% increase) during the treatment trial, and that person demonstrated a decrease in their level of amygdala reactivity. Thus, a higher level of cannabis use was consistently associated with a lower level of amygdala reactivity across all subjects (matched pairs t = 2.70, df = 5, p < 0.05, two-tailed). These findings are consistent with the reports by Phan et al. (2008) and Hariri et al. (2009) suggesting that cannabinoids have an inhibitory effect on threat-related amygdala reactivity.",1
"Distinguishing depression in bipolar disorder (BD) from unipolar depression (UD)  solely based on clinical clues is difficult, which has led to the exploration of  promising neural markers in neuroimaging measures for discriminating between BD depression and UD. In this article, we review structural and functional magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI) studies that directly compare UD and BD depression based  on neuroimaging modalities including functional MRI studies on regional brain activation or functional connectivity, structural MRI on gray or white matter morphology, and pattern classification analyses using a machine learning approach. Numerous studies have reported distinct functional and structural alterations in emotion- or reward-processing neural circuits between BD depression and UD. Different activation patterns in neural networks including the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and striatum  during emotion-, reward-, or cognition-related tasks have been reported between BD and UD. A stronger functional connectivity pattern in BD was pronounced in default mode and in frontoparietal networks and brain regions including the PFC,  ACC, parietal and temporal regions, and thalamus compared to UD. Gray matter volume differences in the ACC, hippocampus, amygdala, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) have been reported between BD and UD, along with a thinner DLPFC in BD compared to UD. BD showed reduced integrity in the anterior part of the corpus callosum and posterior cingulum compared to UD. Several studies performed  pattern classification analysis using structural and functional MRI data to distinguish between UD and BD depression using a supervised machine learning approach, which yielded a moderate level of accuracy in classification.",0
"This study investigated the symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and  associated risk factors among adult survivors 2 mo. after the Wenchuan earthquake in China. 228 survivors completed the Chinese version of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. The prevalence of probable PTSD was 43%. The significant predictive factors for the severity of PTSD symptoms included being female, having lower educational level, being bereaved, and witnessing death. Findings of this study suggest that PTSD is a common mental health problem among earthquake survivors in China. Given inadequate knowledge and practices concerning the mental health of disaster victims in China, the information provided by this study is useful for directing, strengthening, and evaluating disaster-related mental health needs and interventions after earthquakes.",0
"Peritraumatic responses, aside from dissociation, have been understudied in acute trauma populations. Participants were 172 female rape, 68 assault, and 80 robbery victims recruited through formal reporting agencies and assessed 1 month after the crime. Despite substantial overlap across crimes, rape victims reported more emotional responses reflecting fear, detachment, shame, and more nonactive behavioral responses. Regression analysis examining the prediction of perceived threat by peritraumatic responses and crime variables indicated that increased duration of crimes; decreased calmness; increased fear; numbing; use of begging, pleading, and crying; and attempts to reason with the perpetrator(s) were all significantly associated with increased appraisal of threat.",1
"BACKGROUND: Recent laboratory studies have shown that acute alcohol intoxication selectively and effectively dampens aversive responding to uncertain threat. An emerging hypothesis is that individuals who exhibit heightened reactivity to uncertain threat may be especially motivated to use alcohol to dampen their distress, setting the stage for negative reinforcement processes to drive excessive alcohol use. However, no study to date has directly examined whether current problematic drinkers exhibit heightened reactivity to uncertain threat as would be expected. METHODS: The present study was therefore designed to examine the association between current problematic alcohol use and reactivity to uncertain threat during sobriety in two, independent samples. In Study 1 (n=221) and Study 2 (n=74), adult participants completed the same well-validated threat-of-shock task which separately probes responses to temporally predictable and unpredictable threat. Startle potentiation was measured as an index of aversive responding. Problematic alcohol use was defined as number of binge episodes within the past 30days in Study 1 and total scores on a self-report measure of hazardous drinking in Study 2. RESULTS: As hypothesized, across both studies greater levels of problematic drinking were associated with greater startle potentiation to unpredictable threat. In Study 2, hazardous drinking scores were also positively associated with startle potentiation to predictable threat. CONCLUSIONS: The findings are notably consistent with the notion that heightened reactivity to uncertain threat is an important individual difference factor associated with the onset and/or maintenance of problematic drinking behaviors and may therefore be a novel prevention and intervention target.",1
"Complementary therapies are increasingly being used in hospices and hospitals alongside orthodox treatments in an attempt to improve patients' emotional, spiritual, psychological, and physical well-being. An average of 31% of UK patients with cancer use some form of complementary therapy. Many UK cancer centers, out-patient units, and hospices are providing complementary services. There is strong anecdotal evidence that complementary therapies assist in the palliation of physical and psychological symptoms. This systematic review examines the research evidence base for the effectiveness of reflexology in cancer care. The study reports the results of a systematic review following the Cochrane principles of systematic reviewing. No meta-analysis was possible. Studies were retrieved from a comprehensive search of electronic databases from their start dates. An initial search was carried out in 2003 and updated in 2005  to 2006. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time-series studies. Participants were adults  with a diagnosis of cancer, receiving care in any healthcare setting. Interventions were limited to reflexology carried out by a qualified therapist as distinguished from another healthcare professional carrying out a reflexology intervention. Outcome measures were patient-reported levels of physical and psychological indices of symptom distress and quality of life (measured using validated assessment tools).",0
"Acute pain informs the individual that there is an imminent threat of body damage, and is associated with the urge to escape and avoid. Fear learning takes place when neutral stimuli receive the propensity to predict the occurrence of pain, and when defensive responses are initiated in anticipation of potential threats to the integrity of the body. Fear-avoidance models have been put forward featuring the role of individual differences in catastrophic interpretations of pain in the modulation of learning and avoidance. Based on extensive literature on fear reduction in anxiety disorders; cognitive-behavioral treatments have been developed and applied to patients with chronic pain reporting substantial pain-related fear. In this article, we discuss mechanisms underlying the acquisition, the assessment and extinction of pain-related fear through the cognitive-behavioral treatment of pain-related fear. Finally, we provide a number of critical notes and directions for future research in the field of chronic pain and pain-related fear.",1
"In 1977 the American Psychiatric Association called for a critical examination of the clinical effectiveness of meditation. The author provides a review of the literature bearing on clinical and physiological comparisons of meditation with other self-control strategies. He begins by providing a definition of mediation and then cites the literature comparing mediation with such self-regulation strategies as biofeedback, hypnosis, and progressive relaxation. He pays particular attention to the ""uniqueness"" of mediation as a clinical intervention  strategy a well as the adverse effects of meditation. Finally, he offers suggestions and guidelines for future research.",0
"As a step toward addressing limitations in the current psychiatric diagnostic system, the National Institute of Mental Health recently developed the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to stimulate integrative research-spanning self-report, behavior, neural circuitry, and molecular/genetic mechanisms-on core psychological processes implicated in mental illness. Here, we use the RDoC conceptualization to review research on threat responses, reward processing, and their interaction. The first section of the manuscript highlights the pivotal role of exaggerated threat responses-mediated by circuits connecting the frontal cortex, amygdala, and midbrain-in anxiety, and reviews data indicating that genotypic variation in the serotonin system is associated with hyperactivity in this circuitry, which elevates the risk for anxiety and mood disorders. In the second section, we describe mounting evidence linking anhedonic behavior to deficits in psychological functions that rely heavily on dopamine signaling, especially cost/benefit decision making and reward learning. The third section covers recent studies that document negative effects of acute threats and chronic stress on reward responses in humans. The mechanisms underlying such effects are unclear, but the fourth section reviews new optogenetic data in rodents indicating that GABAergic inhibition of midbrain dopamine neurons, driven by activation of the habenula, may play a fundamental role in stress-induced anhedonia. In addition to its basic scientific value, a better understanding of interactions between the neural systems that mediate threat and reward responses may offer relief from the burdensome condition of anxious depression.",1
"To ensure the adequate supply of nutrients, a model food ration (MFR) should be used for planning the menu. The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of the nutrition education program on the compliance with MFR in 231 preschools.  The average supply of food products (per child/day) with reference to the MFR was examined on the baseline and 3 to 6 months after education on the basis of 10-day menus and daily inventory reports (4620 in total). According to the recommendations, preschool should implement 70⁻75% of the recommended daily intake standards. Examined menus had too high content of meat and meat products,  whereas vegetables, milk and fermented milk beverages, cottage cheese and eggs were served in scarce. Education significantly reduced the amount of meat (47.7 vs. 44.5 g), processed meat (16.2 vs. 14.4 g), sugar and sweets (15.9 vs. 14.4 g) and increased the amount of cereals, groats, rice (17.7 vs. 18.5 g), vegetables (164.3 vs. 170.8 g), milk and fermented milk beverages (200.3 vs. 209.5 g) but the compliance with the MFR remained poor. The evaluation of menus stressed the need for further modifying their composition. Education can positively affect the quality of nutrition; however, introduction of the legal nutritional regulations  should be recommended.",0
"Fear generalization occurs when a response, previously acquired with a threatening stimulus, is transferred to a similar one. However, it could be maladaptive when stimuli that do not represent a real threat are appraised as dangerous, which is a hallmark of several anxiety disorders. Stress exposure is a major risk factor for the occurrence of anxiety disorders and it is well established that it influences different phases of fear memory; nevertheless, its impact on the generalization of contextual fear memories has been less studied. In the present work, we have characterized the impact of acute restraint stress prior to contextual fear conditioning on the generalization of this fear memory, and the role of the GABAergic signaling within the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) on the stress modulatory effects. We have found that a single stress exposure promoted the generalization of this memory trace to a different context that was well discriminated in unstressed conditioned animals. Moreover, this effect was dependent on the formation of a contextual associative memory and on the testing order (i.e., conditioning context first vs generalization context first). Furthermore, we observed that increasing GABA-A signaling by intra-BLA midazolam administration prior to the stressful session exposure prevented the generalization of fear memory, whereas intra-BLA administration of the GABA-A antagonist (Bicuculline), prior to fear conditioning, induced the generalization of fear memory in unstressed rats. We concluded that stress exposure, prior to contextual fear conditioning, promotes the generalization of fear memory and that the GABAergic transmission within the BLA has a critical role in this phenomenon.",1
"The behavioral analysis of laboratory rats is usually confined to the level of overt behavior, like locomotion, behavioral inhibition, instrumental responses, and others. Apart from such visible outcome, however, behaviorally relevant information can also be obtained when analyzing the animals' ultrasonic vocalization, which is typically emitted in highly motivational situations, like 22-kHz calls in response to acute or conditioned threat. To further investigate such vocalizations and their relationship with overt behavior, we tested male Wistar rats in a paradigm of Pavlovian fear conditioning, where a tone stimulus (CS) was preceding an aversive foot-shock (US) in a distinct environment. Importantly, the shock dose was varied between groups (0-1.1 mA), and its acute and conditioned outcome were determined. The analysis of visible behavior confirms the usefulness of immobility as a measure of fear conditioning, especially when higher shock doses were used. Rearing and grooming, on the other hand, were more useful to detect conditioned effects with lower shock levels. Ultrasonic vocalization occurred less consistently than changes in overt behavior; however, dose-response relationships were also observed during the phase of conditioning, for example, in latency, call rate and lengths, intervals between calls, and sound amplitude. Furthermore, total calling time (and rate) were highly correlated with overt behavior, namely behavioral inhibition as measured through immobility. These correlations were observed during the phase of fear conditioning, and the subsequent tests. Importantly, conditioned effects in overt behavior were observed, both, to the context and to the CS presented in this context, whereas conditioned vocalization to the context was not observed (except for one rat). In support and extent of previous results, the present data show that a detailed analysis of ultrasonic vocalization can substantially broaden and refine the spectrum of analysis in behavioral work with rats, since it can provide information about situational-, state-, and subject-dependent factors which are partly distinct from what is visible to the experimenter.",1
"Excessive stress exposure often leads to emotional dysfunction, characterized by disruptions in healthy emotional learning, expression, and regulation processes. A prefrontal cortex (PFC)-amygdala circuit appears to underlie these important emotional processes. However, limited human neuroimaging research has investigated whether these brain regions underlie the altered emotional function that develops with stress. Therefore, the present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate stress-induced changes in PFC-amygdala function during Pavlovian fear conditioning. Participants completed a variant of the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST) followed (25min later) by a Pavlovian fear conditioning task during fMRI. Self-reported stress to the MIST was used to identify three stress-reactivity groups (Low, Medium, and High). Psychophysiological, behavioral, and fMRI signal responses were compared between the three stress-reactivity groups during fear conditioning. Fear learning, indexed via participant expectation of the unconditioned stimulus during conditioning, increased with stress reactivity. Further, the High stress-reactivity group demonstrated greater autonomic arousal (i.e., skin conductance response, SCR) to both conditioned and unconditioned stimuli compared to the Low and Medium stress-reactivity groups. Finally, the High stress group did not regulate the emotional response to threat. More specifically, the High stress-reactivity group did not show a negative relationship between conditioned and unconditioned SCRs. Stress-induced changes in these emotional processes paralleled changes in dorsolateral, dorsomedial, and ventromedial PFC function. These findings demonstrate that acute stress facilitates fear learning, enhances autonomic arousal, and impairs emotion regulation, and suggests these stress-induced changes in emotional function are mediated by the PFC.",1
"Psychophysiological measures of fear expression provide observable intermediate phenotypes of fear-related symptoms. Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) advocate using neurobiological intermediate phenotypes that provide dimensional correlates of psychopathology. Negative Valence Systems in the RDoC matrix include the construct of acute threat, which can be measured on a physiological level using potentiation of the acoustic startle reflex assessed via electromyography recordings of the orbicularis oculi muscle. Impairments in extinction of fear-potentiated startle due to high levels of fear (termed fear load) during the early phases of extinction have been observed in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The goals of the current work were to examine dimensional associations between fear-related symptoms of PTSD and fear load variables to test their validity as an intermediate phenotype. We examined extinction of fear-potentiated startle in a cohort (n=269) of individuals with a broad range of civilian trauma exposure (range 0-13 traumatic events per person, mean=3.5). Based on previously reported findings, we hypothesized that fear load would be significantly associated with intrusion and fear memories of an index traumatic event. The results indicated that early extinction was correlated with intrusive thoughts (p=0.0007) and intense physiological reactions to trauma reminders (p=0.036). Degree of adult or childhood trauma exposure, and depression severity were not associated with fear load. After controlling for age, sex, race, income, level of prior trauma, and level of fear conditioning, fear load during extinction was still significantly predictive of intrusive thoughts (p=0.004). The significance of these findings is that they support dimensional associations with symptom severity rather than diagnostic category and, as such, fear load may emerge as a transdiagnostic intermediate phenotype expressed across fear-related disorders (e.g., specific phobia, social phobia).",1
"BACKGROUND: A significant number of smokers would like to stop smoking. Despite the demonstrated efficacy of pharmacological smoking cessation treatments, many smokers are unwilling to use them; however, they are inclined to try alternative  methods. Hypnosis has a long-standing reputation in smoking cessation therapy, but its efficacy has not been scientifically proven. We designed this randomised  controlled trial to evaluate the effects of group hypnosis as a method for smoking cessation, and we will compare the results of group hypnosis with group relaxation. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to compare the efficacy of a single session of hypnosis with that of relaxation performed in groups of 8-15 smokers. We intend to include at least 220 participants in our trial. The inclusion criteria include smoking at least 5 cigarettes per day, not  using other cessation methods and being willing to quit smoking. The intervention is performed by a trained hypnotist/relaxation therapist. Both groups first receive 40 min of mental preparation that is based on motivational interviewing.  Then, a state of deep relaxation is induced in the hypnosis condition, and superficial relaxation is induced in the control condition. Suggestions are made  in the hypnosis condition that aim to switch the mental self-image of the participants from that of smokers to that of non-smokers. Each intervention lasts for 40 min. The participants also complete questionnaires that assess their smoking status and symptoms of depression and anxiety at baseline, 2 weeks and 6  months post-intervention. In addition, saliva samples are collected to assess cotinine levels at baseline and at 6 months post-intervention. We also assess nicotine withdrawal symptoms at 2 weeks post-intervention. DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, this RCT is the first to test the efficacy of group hypnosis versus group relaxation. Issues requiring discussion in the outcome paper include the lack of standardisation of hypnotic interventions in smoking cessation, the debriefing of the participants, the effects of group dynamics and the reasons for dropouts.

"Social fearfulness is expressed on a continuum of severity from moderate distress to incapacitating fear. The present article focuses on the brain states associated with this broad dimension of social anxiety in humans. In total, 70 published studies are summarized documenting the neural correlates of social anxiety during states of rest, threat-related cognitive-affective activation, and acute symptom provocation. Neural exaggeration in limbic (amygdala) and paralimbic (insula) regions appears to be associated with functional outcomes involving increased attention for and processing of social threat. Evidence is also reviewed showing that social anxiety is characterized by atypical functional connectivity in certain brain networks. Despite a higher prevalence of social anxiety disorder among females, males have been overrepresented in the published clinical studies (constituting approximately 56% of the total participants). We evaluate the prospects of nonhuman animal models of social anxiety and discuss several promising directions for future research. The review highlights the need to adopt an integrative, network-based approach to the study of the neural substrates underlying social anxiety.",1
"OBJECTIVE: The authors surveyed psychiatry residents to determine who participates in moonlighting and to understand their views and opinions on the necessity, importance, and educational value of moonlighting. METHODS: An electronic survey was distributed to psychiatry residents at 16 programs nationally. Descriptive characteristics were calculated. Logistic and linear regressions were performed to determine differences between those who moonlight and those who do not and to assess differences in measures of financial distress, quality of life, and work-life balance. RESULTS: A total of 173/624 (27.6%) residents participated. Within the subset allowed to moonlight, 50% (47/94) reported moonlighting during prior academic year, for an average of 17.4 ± 8.6 hoursh per month. Within those eligible to moonlight, there were no differences in perceived financial distress, quality of  life, work-life balance, and confidence between residents who moonlighted and those who did not. Among moonlighters, 10.6% moonlighted overnight before working the next day, and only 68.1% included moonlighting when recording duty hours. 45% reported no supervision available while moonlighting. CONCLUSIONS: In the study sample, 50% of psychiatry residents eligible to moonlight opted to do so. Though most programs have policies in place regarding moonlighting, programs may benefit from ensuring that residents are reporting moonlighting in duty hours and that supervision is available to those moonlighting.",0
"Quality of life (QoL) is increasingly recognized as a pivotal outcome parameter in research on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). While the concept remains somewhat ill-defined, there is now little dispute that the patients' personal goals deserve foremost consideration during the course of treatment as the primary aim of treatment should be relief from individual despair, which is related but by no means synonymous to symptom reduction. Studies using generic (ie, illness-unspecific) instruments have confirmed poor QoL in OCD patients across a wide range of domains, especially with respect to social, work role functioning, and mental health aspects. Scores are sometimes as low as those obtained by patients with schizophrenia. Depression and obsessions are the symptom clusters that most strongly contribute to low QoL. Findings from a novel  survey of 105 OCD participants point to multiple daily life problems, poor work status, and tense social networks in these patients. In order to achieve therapeutic success and improve QoL, functional problems at work and comorbid disorders such as secondary depression and physical impairments should be targeted. While successful treatment sometimes positively impacts well-being, in  some studies symptom decline did not translate into improved QoL.",0
"PTSD is often treated with anxiety management techniques, including relaxation training.

"OBJECTIVE: Sports activities is broadly utilized to support well-being of youth after a disaster or conflict. However, scientific validation of programs have not been conducted. The Mastery Approach to Coaching (MAC) is a coaching-education program on sports activities. The MAC reported to have a positive effect on youngsters' self-esteem. As self-esteem is generally known to be beneficial for mental status, we tested the effect of a MAC program on students' self-esteem in  a disaster-affected area: Leyte, Philippines. We recruited 10th grade students from three schools; one school was allocated to the MAC intervention and the two  schools to the control group. All schools were encouraged to involve students in  volleyball from January to February 2015. In January 2015, MAC workshop was conducted in the intervention school before the sports activity. RESULTS: A total of 293 students completed the questionnaires. The intervention school (n = 51) showed a significant change in self-esteem, with the mean score increasing from 20.2 to 21.1 (p = 0.02). Neither school in the control group showed the significant change. The result showed the feasibility and a positive effect of sports activity with the MAC. However, further investigation should be  conducted. Trial registration UMIN Clinical Trials Registry ID: UMIN000033197 on  June 30th 2018. Retrospectively registered.",0
"AIMS: Only a few studies have attempted to assess the relationship between junk food consumption and cardiometabolic risk factors in Iranian children and adolescents; therefore, the aim of our study was to determine the association between junk food intake and cardiometabolic risk factors in this population. STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study. METHODS: A total of 14,400 students were selected from 30 provinces of Iran using multistage, stratified cluster sampling method. Information about student's lifestyle, health behaviors and health status was obtained through a validated questionnaire. Blood pressure was measured and anthropometric indices were calculated. Blood samples were drawn from 3,303 students for biochemical tests. In our study, sugar-sweetened beverages, salty snacks, sweets and fast foods were considered as junk foods. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 12.42 ± 2.97 years. Those with metabolic syndrome were more likely to live in urban areas (P = 0.004) and have higher BMI (P < 0.0001). Junk food intake was not related to metabolic syndrome;  however, it was associated with increased odds of high BP (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.09,  1.39), high SBP (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.09, 1.75), and high DBP (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.04, 1.35), overweight (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.08, 1.39) and excess weight (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04, 1.25). CONCLUSIONS: Junk food consumption plays an important role in childhood overweight and is related to high blood pressure in this population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, case-control analytic studies.",0
"Objectives: Research suggests targeted exercise is important for people living with dementia, especially those living in residential care. The aim of this review was to collect and synthesize evidence on the known barriers and facilitators to adherence to group exercise of institutionalized older people living with dementia. Methods: We searched all available electronic databases. Additionally, we searched trial registries (clinicaltrial.gov, and WHO ICTRP) for ongoing studies. We searched for and included papers from January 1990 until September 2017 in any language. We included randomized, non-randomized trials. Studies were not eligible if participants were either healthy older people or people suffering from dementia but not living in an institution. Studies were also excluded if they were not focused on barriers and facilitators to adherence to group exercise. Results: Using narrative analysis, we identified the following themes for barriers: bio-medical reasons and mental wellbeing and physical ability, relationships dynamics, and socioeconomic reasons. The facilitators were grouped  under the following thematic frames: bio-medical benefits and benefits related to physical ability, feelings and emotions and confidence improvements, therapist and group relationships dynamics and activity related reasons. Conclusions: We conclude that institutionalized older people living with dementia, even those who are physically frail, incontinent and/or have mild dementia can demonstrate certain level of exercise adherence, and therefore can respond positively to exercise programs. Tailored, individually-adjusted and supported physical activity, led by a knowledgeable, engaging and well communicating therapist/facilitator improves the adherence to group exercise interventions of institutionalized older people living with dementia.",0
"RATIONALE: Serotonin (5-HT) plays a key role in different aspects of value-based  decision-making. A recent framework proposed that tonic 5-HT (together with dopamine, DA) codes future average reward expectations, providing a baseline against which possible choice outcomes are compared to guide decision-making. OBJECTIVES: To test whether high 5-HT levels decrease loss aversion, risk-seeking for gains, and risk-seeking for losses. METHODS: In a first session, 611 participants were genotyped for 5-HTTLPR and performed a mixed gambles (MGA) task and two probability discounting tasks for gains and losses, respectively (PDG/PDL). Afterwards, a subsample of 105 participants (44 with S/S, 6 with S/L, 55 with L/L genotype) completed the pharmacological study using a crossover design with tryptophan depletion (ATD), loading (ATL), and balanced (BAL) conditions. The same decision constructs were assessed. RESULTS: We found increased risk-seeking for losses in S/S compared to L/L individuals at the first visit (p = 0.002). Neither tryptophan depletion nor loading affected decision-making, nor did we observe an interaction between intervention and 5-HTTLPR genotype. CONCLUSION: Our data do not support the idea that transient changes of tonic 5-HT affect value-based decision-making. We provide evidence for an association of 5-HTTLPR with risk-seeking for losses, independent of acute 5-HT levels. This indicates that the association of 5-HTTLPR and risk-seeking for losses is mediated via other mechanisms, possibly by differences in the structural development of neural circuits of the 5-HT system during early life phases.",0
"Patients with generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD) exhibit heightened activation of the amygdala in response to social cues conveying threat (eg, fearful/angry faces). The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) decreases anxiety and stress, facilitates social encounters, and attenuates amygdala reactivity to threatening faces in healthy subjects. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of OXT on fear-related amygdala reactivity in GSAD and matched healthy control (CON) subjects. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study utilizing a double-blind placebo-controlled within-subjects design, we measured amygdala activation to an emotional face matching task of fearful, angry, and happy faces following acute intranasal administration of OXT (24 IU or 40.32 mug) and placebo in 18 GSAD and 18 CON subjects. Both the CON and GSAD groups activated bilateral amygdala to all emotional faces during placebo, with the GSAD group exhibiting hyperactivity specifically to fearful faces in bilateral amygdala compared with the CON group. OXT had no effect on amygdala activity to emotional faces in the CON group, but attenuated the heightened amygdala reactivity to fearful faces in the GSAD group, such that the hyperactivity observed during the placebo session was no longer evident following OXT (ie, normalization). These findings suggest that OXT has a specific effect on fear-related amygdala activity, particularly when the amygdala is hyperactive, such as in GSAD, thereby providing a brain-based mechanism of the impact of OXT in modulating the exaggerated processing of social signals of threat in patients with pathological anxiety.",1
"Objective Smartphone health applications (apps) are being increasingly used to assist patients in chronic disease self-management. The effects of such apps on patient outcomes are uncertain, as are design features that maximise usability and efficacy, and the best methods for evaluating app quality and utility.Methods In assessing efficacy, PubMed, Cochrane Library and EMBASE were searched for systematic reviews (and single studies if no systematic review was available) published between January 2007 and January 2018 using search terms (and synonyms) of 'smartphone' and 'mobile applications', and terms for each of 11 chronic diseases: asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic pain, serious mental health disorders, alcohol and substance addiction, heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, cancer, cognitive impairment, chronic kidney disease (CKD). With regard to design features and evaluation methods, additional  reviews were sought using search terms 'design', 'quality,' 'usability', 'functionality,' 'adherence', 'evaluation' and related synonyms.Results Of 13 reviews and six single studies assessing efficacy, consistent evidence of benefit was seen only with apps for diabetes, as measured by decreased glycosylated haemoglobin levels (HbA1c). Some, but not all, studies showed benefit in asthma,  low back pain, alcohol addiction, heart failure, ischaemic heart disease and cancer. There was no evidence of benefit in COPD, cognitive impairment or CKD. In all studies, benefits were clinically marginal and none related to morbid events  or hospitalisation. Twelve design features were identified as enhancing usability. An evaluation framework comprising 32 items was formulated.Conclusion  Evidence of clinical benefit of most available apps is very limited. Design features that enhance usability and maximise efficacy were identified. A provisional 'first-pass' evaluation framework is proposed that can help decide which apps should be endorsed by government agencies following more detailed technical assessments and which could then be recommended with confidence by clinicians to their patients.What is known about the topic? Smartphone health apps have attracted considerable interest from patients and health managers as a  means of promoting more effective self-management of chronic diseases, which leads to better health outcomes. However, most commercially available apps have never been evaluated for benefits or harms in clinical trials, and there are currently no agreed quality criteria, standards or regulations to ensure health apps are user-friendly, accurate in content, evidence based or efficacious.What does this paper add? This paper presents a comprehensive review of evidence relating to the efficacy, usability and evaluation of apps for 11 common diseases aimed at assisting patients in self-management. Consistent evidence of benefit was only seen for diabetes apps; there was absent or conflicting evidence of benefit for apps for the remaining 10 diseases. Benefits that were detected were  of marginal clinical importance, with no reporting of hard clinical end-points, such as mortality or hospitalisations. Only a minority of studies explicitly reported using behaviour change theories to underpin the app intervention. Many apps lacked design features that the literature identified as enhancing usability and potential to confer benefit. Despite a plethora of published evaluation tools, there is no universal framework that covers all relevant clinical and technical attributes. An inclusive list of evaluation criteria is proposed that may overcome this shortcoming.What are the implications for practitioners? The number of smartphone apps will continue to grow, as will the appetite for patients and clinicians to use them in chronic disease self-management. However,  the evidence to date of clinical benefit of most apps already available is very limited. Design features that enhance usability and clinical efficacy need to be  considered. In making decisions about which apps should be endorsed by government agencies and recommended with confidence by clinicians to their patients, a comprehensive but workable evaluation framework needs to be used by bodies assuming the roles of setting and applying standards.",0
"Rodent striatum is involved in sensory-motor transformations and reward-related learning. Lesion studies suggest dorsolateral striatum, dorsomedial striatum and  nucleus accumbens underlie stimulus-response transformations, goal-directed behaviour and reward expectation, respectively. In addition, prefrontal inputs likely control these functions. Here, we set out to study how reward-driven behaviour is mediated by the coordinated activity of these structures in the intact brain. We implemented a discrimination task requiring rats to either respond or suppress responding on a lever after the presentation of auditory cues in order to obtain rewards. Single unit activity in the striatal subregions and pre-limbic cortex was recorded using tetrode arrays. Striatal units showed strong onset responses to auditory cues paired with an opportunity to obtain reward. Cue-onset responses in both striatum and cortex were significantly modulated by previous errors suggesting a role of these structures in maintaining appropriate  motivation or action selection during ongoing behaviour. Furthermore, failure to  respond to the reward-paired tones was associated with higher pre-trial coherence among striatal subregions and between cortex and striatum suggesting a task-negative corticostriatal network whose activity may be suppressed to enable  processing of reward-predictive cues. Our findings highlight that coordinated activity in a distributed network including both pre-limbic cortex and multiple striatal regions underlies reward-related decisions.",0
"There is mounting evidence that single administrations of glucocorticoids may acutely reduce human fear. We previously reported that administration of cortisol acutely reduced non-spatial selective attention to fearful faces and likewise reduced preferential processing of fearful faces in a spatial working memory task. Here we report the acute effects of 40 mg cortisol (administered in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design) on a different experimental task for measuring threat-selective attention. Twenty healthy young males had to localize a target which was presented in a peripheral location that was either gazed at or not by a preceding dynamic happy or fearful face. This reliable method has been used repeatedly to demonstrate fear-driven selective attention. Present results showed that after placebo, as usual, the fearful gaze cues caused stronger orienting of attention than happy faces. Cortisol abolished this typical anxious response pattern, but only in low anxious participants. These data provide evidence that cortisol acutely influences also spatial threat-selective attention.

"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with dysfunction of the neural circuitry that supports fear learning and memory processes. However, much of what is known about neural dysfunction in PTSD is based on research in chronic PTSD populations. Less is known about neural function that supports fear learning acutely following trauma exposure. Determining the acute effects of trauma exposure on brain function would provide new insight into the neural processes that mediate the cognitive-affective dysfunction associated with PTSD. Therefore, the present study investigated neural activity that supports fear learning and memory processes in recently Trauma-Exposed (TE) and Non-Trauma-Exposed (NTE) participants. Participants completed a Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During fMRI, participants' threat expectancy was continuously monitored. NTE participants showed greater threat expectancy during warning than safety cues, while no difference was observed in the TE group. This finding suggests TE participants overgeneralized the fear association to the safety cue. Further, only the TE group showed a negative relationship between fMRI signal responses within dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and threat expectancy during safety cues. These results suggest the dorsomedial PFC mediates overgeneralization of learned fear as an acute result of trauma exposure. Finally, neural activity within the PFC and inferior parietal lobule showed a negative relationship with PTSD symptom severity assessed three months posttrauma. Thus, neural activity measured acutely following trauma exposure predicted future PTSD symptom severity. The present findings elucidate the acute effects of trauma exposure on cognitive-affective function and provide new insight into the neural mechanisms of PTSD.",1
"Objectives: Consumers routinely seek health and nutrition-related information from online sources, including social media platforms. This study identified popular online nutrition content to examine the advice and assess alignment with  the Australian Guideline to Healthy Eating (AGHE). Methods: We used Facebook page ""likes"" as an indicator of popularity to identify  online nutrition and diet content. Websites and blogs associated with pages that  had more than 100,000 Australian likes on 7th September 2017 were included. The dietary advice promoted was collected and compared with the AGHE across nine categories (Vegetables, Fruits, Legumes, Grains, Lean Meat, Dairy/Alternative, Fat, Sugar, Salt). Results: Nine Facebook pages met the inclusion criteria. The four most-liked pages were hosted by celebrities. Only two pages and their associated websites had advice consistent with AGHE recommendations across all nine categories reviewed. The concept of ""real food"" was a popular theme online. While most sources advocated increasing vegetable consumption and reducing processed food, other advice was not evidence-based and frequently deviated from the AGHE. Discussion: Health information seekers are exposed to a variety of online dietary information and lifestyle advice. While few public health goals are promoted, there are many contradictions, as well as deviations from the AGHE, which can create confusion among health information seekers. Public health organisations promoting AGHE on Facebook are few and not as popular. Conclusion: Public health organisations need to be more engaged on popular internet platforms such as Facebook. The prevailing popular nutrition advice online may increase consumer confusion, scepticism and even avoidance of dietary  advice. Proactive efforts are needed by public health organisations, in partnership social marketing experts, to create and share engaging and accurate nutrition content. Partnership with celebrities should be explored to improve reach and impact of evidence-based diet recommendations online.",0
"AIMS: This study was primarily aimed for developing and testing a valid and reliable instrument that measures perceived threat of the risk for graft rejection after organ transplantation. A second aim was to report descriptive data regarding graft rejection and Health-Related Quality of Life. BACKGROUND: The most serious risk connected with transplantations besides infection is graft rejection. DESIGN: Non experimental, descriptive involving instrument development and psychometric assessment. METHOD: Questionnaires about perceived threat of the risk for graft rejection and Health-Related Quality of Life were mailed to 229 OTRs between 19-65 years old. The items were formed from a previous interview study. Patients were transplanted with a kidney, a liver or a heart and/or a lung. All patients with follow-up time of one year +/- three months and three years +/- three months were included. RESULTS: With an 81% response rate, the study comprised of 185 OTRs, who had received either a kidney (n = 117), a liver (n = 39) or heart or lung (n = 29). Three homogenous factors of perceived threat for graft rejection were revealed, labelled 'intrusive anxiety', 'graft-related threat' and 'lack of control'. Tests of internal consistency showed good item-scale convergent and discriminatory validity. A majority of the OTRs scored low levels for 'intrusive anxiety'. The kidney transplant recipients experienced more 'graft-related threat' by acute graft rejection than those transplanted with a liver, heart or lung. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study suggests that it is possible to measure the perceived threat of the risk for graft rejection in three homogenous factors. Relevance to clinical practice. The instrument perceived threat of the risk for graft rejection, might be usable to measure the impact of fear of graft rejection, to predict needs of pedagogical intervention strategies to reduce fear and to improve Health-Related Quality of Life related to graft rejection.",1
"Many musicians experience debilitating music performance anxiety (MPA). Outside music performance, imagery-based interventions have been incorporated into treatment protocols to help individuals, including athletes and those with social anxiety, manage heightened levels of anxiety in order to excel in performance-based domains. Despite the frequent use of mental imagery in MPA interventions and its importance as a mental rehearsal technique for musicians, no existing reviews have examined the literature on imagery-based interventions for MPA. The primary aim of this review was to analyze the existing MPA literature in order to summarize what is known about the efficacy and mechanisms  of pre-performance mental imagery exercises. A literature search yielded eight studies that used imagery-based interventions for MPA, in both student and professional musicians, which included three dissertations and five peer-reviewed journal articles. In extant MPA treatment research, pre-performance imagery is often used in conjunction with other techniques in order to alleviate anxiety. Arousal imagery refers to imagining one's state of arousal during performance and has been incorporated into MPA interventions in various ways that guide musicians to anticipate the heightened arousal that accompanies performance, predominantly  through imagery-based relaxation techniques. However, methodological limitations  make it impossible to determine whether imagery is itself an active ingredient of treatment that underlies symptom changes, or whether relaxation imagery is the most effective use of pre-performance imagery for all musicians. There is much need for future well-controlled studies to examine whether and how imagery affects MPA independent of the other therapy components and techniques with which it is commonly combined.",0
"Chronically elevated HPA activity has often been associated with fear and anxiety, but there is evidence that single administrations of glucocorticoids may acutely reduce fear. Moreover, peri-traumatic cortisol elevation may protect against development of post-traumatic stress disorder. Hypervigilant processing of threat information plays a role in anxiety disorders and although relations with HPA functioning have been established, causality of these relations remains unclear. Presently, self-reported anxiety and response time patterns on a masked emotional Stroop task with fearful faces were measured in 20 healthy young men after double-blind, placebo-controlled oral administration of 40 mg cortisol. The masked fearful Stroop task measures vocal colornaming response latencies for pictures of neutral and fearful faces presented below the threshold for conscious perception. Results showed increased response times on trials for fearful compared to neutral faces after placebo, but this emotional Stroop effect was acutely abolished by cortisol administration. This effect was most pronounced in subjects with heightened anxiety levels. This is the first evidence showing that exogenous cortisol acutely reduces anxiety-driven selective attention to threat. These results extend earlier findings of acute fear reduction after glucocorticoid administration. This suggests interactions of HPA functioning and vigilant attention in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders. Possible neuroendocrine mechanisms of action are discussed.",1
"Recent evidence suggests that the steroid hormone testosterone can decrease the functional coupling between orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and amygdala. Theoretically this decoupling has been linked to a testosterone-driven increase of goal-directed behaviour in case of threat, but this has never been studied directly. Therefore, we placed twenty-two women in dynamically changing situations of escapable and inescapable threat after a within-subject placebo controlled testosterone administration. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we provide evidence that testosterone activates the left lateral OFC (LOFC) in preparation of active goal-directed escape and decouples this OFC area from a subcortical threat system including the central-medial amygdala, hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray. This LOFC decoupling was specific to threatening situations, a point that was further emphasized by an absence of such decoupling in a second experiment focused on resting-state connectivity. These results not only confirm that testosterone administration decouples the LOFC from the subcortical threat system, but also show that this is specifically the case in response to acute threat, and ultimately leads to an increase in LOFC activity when the participant prepares a goal-directed action to escape. Together these results for the first time provide a detailed understanding of functional brain alterations induced by testosterone under threat conditions, and corroborate and extend the view that testosterone prepares the brain for goal-directed action in case of threat.",1
"OBJECTIVES:: To further progress Kaupapa Māori ( Māori focused) approaches within mental health services this study explored the experiences of Māori clinicians from a dedicated Māori mental health service in New Zealand, with a focus on a specific Kaupapa Māori therapeutic approach, Mahi-a-Atua. METHODS:: A qualitative approach was used to ascertain factors that facilitate and obstruct the utilization of Mahi-a-Atua. In a focus group hui ( Māori meeting process), eight Māori clinicians discussed their experiences. RESULTS:: Facilitation of Mahi-a-Atua by Māori clinicians occurred through interconnectedness of a number of factors including cultural identity, relationships, wairuatanga (spirituality), kaitiakitanga (guardianship), validation of the model and the ability to co-work and engage in meaningful wānanga (learning) around the intervention. The extent to which clinicians used the model depended on their own perceived knowledge and confidence and how best able to integrate both cultural and clinical knowledge. Other constraining factors pertained to inadequate prior training, limited workforce development training and lack of adequate resourcing for specialized services. CONCLUSIONS:: This research highlights the need for Māori focused specialized training that utilizes co-working within sessions and ongoing wānanga.",0
"Two things are worth remembering about an aversive event: What made it happen? What made it cease? If a stimulus precedes an aversive event, it becomes a signal for threat and will later elicit behavior indicating conditioned fear. However, if the stimulus is presented upon cessation of the aversive event, it elicits behavior indicating conditioned ""relief."" What are the neuronal bases for such learning? Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans we found that a fear-conditioned stimulus activates amygdala but not striatum, whereas a relief-conditioned stimulus activates striatum but not amygdala. Correspondingly, acute inactivation of amygdala or of ventral striatum in rats respectively abolished only conditioned fear or only conditioned relief. Thus, the behaviorally opponent memories supported by onset and offset of aversive events engage and require fear and reward networks, respectively. This may explain attraction to stimuli associated with the cessation of trauma or of panic attacks.",1
"Development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is influenced by external factors during early life in mammals, which optimizes adult function for predicted conditions. We have hypothesized that adolescence represents a sensitive period for the development of some aspects of adult stress response regulation. This was based on prior work showing that repeated exposure of rats to a stressor across an adolescent period increases fearfulness in a novel environment in adulthood and results in lower levels of dopamine receptor subtype-2 protein in prefrontal cortex. Here, we further our investigation of both acute and long-term effects of repeated adolescent stressor exposure on physiological (i.e., corticosterone) and behavioral (i.e., defensive behavior) measures of stress responding in male and female rats. Furthermore, we compared outcomes with those following identical manipulations administered in early adulthood and found that animals exposed to cues of predation threat during adolescence showed the most robust defensive responses to a homotypic stressor encountered in adulthood. Peer interaction during control manipulation in adolescence was identified as an important individual characteristic mediating development of adult defensive strategies.",1
"Late-latency auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials are sensitive to some centrally acting drugs and to certain psychological interventions. In this experiment we compared the effects of acute doses of a benzodiazepine, diazepam and an H(1) histamine receptor-blocking sedative, diphenhydramine, on auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials within the latency range 100-500 ms in a fear conditioning paradigm. Twelve healthy males (18-30 years) participated in three sessions at weekly intervals in which they received diazepam 10mg, diphenhydramine 75 mg and placebo in a balanced, double-blind, crossover protocol. One hundred and twenty min after diphenhydramine or 60 min after diazepam, they underwent an 8 min recording period in which auditory evoked potentials elicited by 40 ms, 95 dB[A], 1 kHz tones, and somatosensory evoked potentials elicited by a mildly painful electric shock (1.8 mA, 50 ms) were recorded at Cz (vertex). Each session consisted of four blocks of trials in which either the sound pulse or the shock was presented. Alternate blocks were designated SAFE or THREAT ('context' conditions); in THREAT blocks subjects were warned that shocks would be delivered via electrodes placed on the wrist (electrodes were removed during SAFE blocks). In one SAFE and one THREAT block, the sound stimuli and shocks (shocks were delivered only in the THREAT block) were preceded by a 2 s conditioned stimulus (CS: a red light) ('cue' condition). Diazepam, but not diphenhydramine, reduced the amplitude of the P2 auditory evoked potential. The THREAT context was associated with increased N1 and reduced N2 potential amplitudes. The CS had no effect on the amplitudes, but markedly reduced the latencies of the N1, P2 and N2 potentials under the THREAT condition. Diazepam reduced the amplitudes of the somatosensory potential evoked by the shock; the CS shortened the latencies of the later components of the response. Diazepam and diphenhydramine were approximately equi-sedative in the doses used in this experiment, as judged by visual analogue self-rating scales. The results indicate that the suppression of late-latency auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials by diazepam is not simply a reflection of sedation. Late-latency evoked potentials can be modified by an aversive CS, but the components that are sensitive to the CS are different from those that are sensitive to diazepam.",1
"Although the long-acting opiate methadone is commonly used to treat drug addiction, relatively little is known about the effects of withdrawal from this drug in preclinical models. The current study examined affective, neuroendocrine, and somatic signs of withdrawal from the longer-acting methadone derivative l-alpha-acetylmethydol (LAAM) in rats. Anxiety-like behavior during both spontaneous and antagonist-precipitated withdrawal was measured by potentiation of the startle reflex. Withdrawal elevated corticosterone and somatic signs and blunted circadian variations in baseline startle responding. In addition, fear to an explicit, Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (fear-potentiated startle) was enhanced. These data suggest that anxiety-like behavior as measured using potentiated startle responding does not emerge spontaneously during withdrawal from chronic opiate exposure - in contrast to withdrawal from acute drug exposure - but rather is manifested as exaggerated fear in response to explicit threat cues.",1
"BACKGROUND/AIM: Urgent psychiatric help and effective psychotherapeutic treatments are required soon after revival of a person after suicide attempt by self-poisoning. The aim of this article was to define an assessment of actual psychological characteristics of a person after suicide attempt by self-poisoning in order to apply psychotherapeutic crisis intervention after suicide attempt, as well as to show an approach to the treatment guided by the assessment that uses a psychodynamic model of suicidal crisis intervention based on our clinical experience. METHODS: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), Defensive Questionnaire Scale (DSQ-40), Scaling of Life Events (Paykel), and Pierce Suicide Intent Scale (SIS) were applied in 30 hospitalized persons following suicide attempt by self-poisoning and in 30 patients who had asked for psychiatric examination at the outpatient clinic due to various life crises not resulting in suicide attempt. The examinees of both groups were matched by sex, age, and education, professional and marital status.  Comparison of the patient groups was done by the t-test. Logistic regression analysis was used for suicidal risk assessment. RESULTS: The suicide attempters were depressed (HAMD = 22.60 +/- 5.93, CES-D = 29.67 +/- 7.99), with medium suicide risk factor (SIS = 4.5 +/- 4.17), using immature (projection, dissociation, devaluation, acting-out) and neurotic (altruism) defense mechanisms. The most important motives for suicide attempt were separation problems, problems with parents and a problem of loneliness. The  commonest feelings and thoughts of a subject preceding suicide attempt were a wish to escape an unbearable situation, loss of control, desire to show love for  a partner and wish to be helped. After a suicide attempt, 90% of the persons felt relief because the attempt failed, although almost half of them intend to repeat  it. The risk of repeated suicide attempt was 1.8 (90% CI = 0.09-37.70, p < 0.001) times higher if values on the SIS Total Score were increased and 1.62 (90% CI = 0.03-81.39, p < 0.001) times higher if values on the SIS 1 (Circumstances Score)  subscale were increased, too. CONCLUSION: Before starting with psychotherapy for persons after suicide attempt  by self-poisoning it is very important to define psychological assessment of a person, choose the treatment (out-patient clinic or inpatient/hospital), assess indications for pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy that also must include a selection of patients for application of this therapeutic method. Assessment of conscientious and unconscientious conflicts leading to a suicide attempt represents initial basis for a therapist's work with a patient after suicide attempt and for application of psychotherapeutic crisis intervention.",0
"Stress broadly affects the ability to regulate emotions and may contribute to generalization of threat-related behaviors to harmless stimuli. Behavioral generalization also tends to increase over time as memory precision for recent events gives way to more gist-like representations. Thus, acute stress coupled with a delay in time from a negative experience may be a strong predictor of the transition from normal to generalized fear expression. Here, we investigated the effect of a single-episode acute stressor on generalization of aversive learning when stress is administered either immediately after an aversive learning event or following a delay. In a between-subjects design, healthy adult volunteers underwent threat (fear) conditioning using a tone-conditioned stimulus paired with an electric shock to the wrist and another tone not paired with shock. Behavioral generalization was tested to a range of novel tones either on the same day (experiment 1) or 24 h later (experiment 2) and was preceded by either an acute stress induction or a control task. Anticipatory sympathetic arousal [i.e., skin conductance responses (SCRs)] and explicit measures of shock expectancy served as dependent measures. Stress administered shortly after threat conditioning did not affect behavioral generalization. In contrast, stress administered following a delay led to heightened arousal and increased generalization of SCRs and explicit measures of shock expectancy. These findings show that acute stress increases generalization of older but not recent threat memories and have clinical relevance to understanding overgeneralization characteristics of anxiety and stress-related disorders.",1
"Past studies have shown that personal subjective happiness is associated with various macro- and micro-level background factors, including environmental conditions, such as weather and the economic situation, and personal health behaviors, such as smoking and exercise. We contribute to this literature of happiness studies by using a geospatial approach to examine both macro and micro  links to personal happiness. Our geospatial approach incorporates two major global datasets: representative national survey data from the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) and corresponding world weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). After processing and filtering 55,081 records of ISSP 2011 survey data from 32 countries, we extracted 5,420 records from China and 25,441 records from 28 other countries. Sensitivity  analyses of different intervals for average weather variables showed that macro-level conditions, including temperature, wind speed, elevation, and GDP, are positively correlated with happiness. To distinguish the effects of weather conditions on happiness in different seasons, we also adopted climate zone and seasonal variables. The micro-level analysis indicated that better health status  and eating more vegetables or fruits are highly associated with happiness. Never  engaging in physical activity appears to make people less happy. The findings suggest that weather conditions, economic situations, and personal health behaviors are all correlated with levels of happiness.",0
"This research investigated the cognitive mechanisms that underlie impairments in  human reasoning triggered by the emotional see-saw technique. It has previously been stated that such manipulation is effective as it presumably induces a mindless state and cognitive deficits in compliant individuals. Based on the dual-system architecture of reasoning (system 2) and affective decision-making (system 1), we challenged the previous theoretical account by indicating that the main source of compliance is impairment of the meta-reasoning system when rapid affective changes occur. To examine this hypothesis, we manipulated affective feelings (system 1 processing) by violating participants' expectations regarding  reward and performance in a go/no-go task in which individuals were to inhibit their responses to earn money. Aside from the go/no-go performance, we measured rationality (meta-reasoning system 2) in decision-making by asking participants to comply with a nonsensical request. We found that participants who were exposed to meta-reasoning impairments due to the emotional see-saw phenomenon exhibited mindless behavior.",0
"Our mood often fluctuates without warning. Recent accounts propose that these fluctuations might be preceded by changes in how we process reward. According to  this view, the degree to which reward improves our mood reflects not only characteristics of the reward itself (e.g., its magnitude) but also how receptive to reward we happen to be. Differences in receptivity to reward have been suggested to play an important role in the emergence of mood episodes in psychiatric disorders [1-16]. However, despite substantial theory, the relationship between reward processing and daily fluctuations of mood has yet to  be tested directly. In particular, it is unclear whether the extent to which people respond to reward changes from day to day and whether such changes are followed by corresponding shifts in mood. Here, we use a novel mobile-phone platform with dense data sampling and wearable heart-rate and electroencephalographic sensors to examine mood and reward processing over an extended period of one week. Subjects regularly performed a trial-and-error choice task in which different choices were probabilistically rewarded. Subjects' choices revealed two complementary learning processes, one fast and one slow. Reward prediction errors [17, 18] indicative of these two processes were decodable from subjects' physiological responses. Strikingly, more accurate decodability of prediction-error signals reflective of the fast process predicted improvement in subjects' mood several hours later, whereas more accurate decodability of the slow process' signals predicted better mood a whole day later. We conclude that real-life mood fluctuations follow changes in responsivity to reward at multiple timescales.",0
"Quick and accurate judgments of emotional expressivity and attractiveness facilitate social interactions. Eye tracking was used to examine left/right asymmetries across 2 studies. Fixations to each hemiface, and to the eyes and mouth, when judging attractiveness and emotional expressivity were examined. Overall, more fixations occurred on the left hemiface (from the viewer's point of view), even when mirror-reversed, supporting the suggestion that we intuitively know the left hemiface is more expressive. The right side of the mouth was fixated more when judging happiness, whereas the left eye was fixated more for sadness and the left mouth when rating emotional expressivity. The present findings support the notion that the right hemisphere and valence-specific hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. The right hemisphere hypothesis is supported when assessing global facial qualities (i.e., hemiface); however, hemispheric processing differences emerge when exploring the eyes and mouth. The  current findings highlight the importance of not only considering how the face is examined more generally, but of also exploring smaller regions of interest to investigate lateral biases. Future research should therefore include analyses of  fixations to the hemifaces, as well as to these smaller regions of interest.",0
"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with  symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse (POP) in a representative sample of postmenopausal Chinese women. METHODS: A total of 20,008 postmenopausal Chinese women were recruited to this cross-sectional study between February 2014 and March 2016. The prevalence of symptomatic POP, defined as any stage II or higher POP resulting in symptoms, was assessed using questionnaires and physical examinations. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with symptomatic POP. RESULTS: Among all women with natural menopause included in the study (mean age =61.98 ± 10.62 years), 2962 of 20,008 women (14.80%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 14.3-15.3%) had symptomatic POP. In the multivariate analysis, women were more likely to have symptomatic POP if aged 50-59 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.322, 95% CI 1.123-1.560), 60-69 years (AOR 1.603, 95% CI 1.352-1.907), or above 70 years (AOR 1.824, 95% CI 1.158-2.197), compared with women aged 40-49 years. Having delivered two times (AOR 1.145, 95% CI 1.105-1.292) or three or more times (AOR 1.384, 95% CI 1.214-1.578) was significantly associated with symptomatic POP. Compared with normal weight women, overweight women (AOR 1.365, 95% CI 1.247-1.494) and obese women (AOR 1.548, 95% CI 1.344-1.780) were more likely to  have POP. Living in an urban area, smoking, alcohol consumption, cough, constipation, mental labor, physical disease, and gynecological diseases were also associated with symptomatic POP. CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic POP affects nearly 15% of postmenopausal women in China. The prevalence of symptomatic POP increases significantly with age, body mass index, and parity.",0
"This study examined the effects of oral administration of 20mg hydrocortisone on baseline and fear-potentiated startle in 63 male veterans with or without PTSD. The procedure was based on a two-session, within-subject design in which acoustic startle eyeblink responses were recorded during intervals of threat or no threat of electric shock. Results showed that the magnitude of the difference between startle responses recorded during anticipation of imminent shock compared to ""safe"" periods was reduced after hydrocortisone administration relative to placebo. This effect did not vary as a function of PTSD group nor were there were any significant group differences in other indices startle amplitude. Findings suggest that the acute elevations in systemic cortisol produced by hydrocortisone administration may have fear-inhibiting effects. This finding may have implications for understanding the role of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis function in vulnerability and resilience to traumatic stress.",1
"In today's world, mass-media and online social networks present us with unprecedented exposure to second-hand, vicarious experiences and thereby the chance of forming associations between previously innocuous events (e.g., being in a subway station) and aversive outcomes (e.g., footage or verbal reports from a violent terrorist attack) without direct experience. Such social threat, or fear, learning can have dramatic consequences, as manifested in acute stress symptoms and maladaptive fears. However, most research has so far focused on socially acquired threat responses that are expressed as increased arousal rather than active behavior. In three experiments (n = 120), we examined the effect of indirect experiences on behaviors by establishing a link between social threat learning and instrumental decision making. We contrasted learning from direct experience (i.e., Pavlovian conditioning) (experiment 1) against two common forms of social threat learning-social observation (experiment 2) and verbal instruction (experiment 3)-and how this learning transferred to subsequent instrumental decision making using behavioral experiments and computational modeling. We found that both types of social threat learning transfer to decision making in a strong and surprisingly inflexible manner. Notably, computational modeling indicated that the transfer of observational and instructed threat learning involved different computational mechanisms. Our results demonstrate the strong influence of others' expressions of fear on one's own decisions and have important implications for understanding both healthy and pathological human behaviors resulting from the indirect exposure to threatening events.",1
"Federal law and most states prohibit possession of firearms by individuals with a history of certain psychiatric diagnoses and/or treatment. In California, an involuntary 72-h hold can trigger a 5-year ban on firearm possession. Individuals so prohibited may petition for early termination of the ban. We report on the demographic and psychiatric characteristics of a sample of individuals petitioning for early relief in Los Angeles County, and on the results of their petitions. The majority of petitioners were Caucasian men over age 40. Sixteen percent of petitioners were employed in law enforcement or armed security, and all of their petitions were granted. Individuals for whom there was greater evidence of mental disorder were significantly less likely to petition successfully. The results are discussed in terms of the benefits of involving a forensic expert in the petition process, which is not presently required under California law.",0
"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether exposure to curve versus sharp contours in the built healthcare setting produces systematic and identifiable patterns of amygdala activation and behavioral response in healthy adults. BACKGROUND: Recent studies in cognitive neuroscience suggest that humans prefer objects with a curved contour compared with objects that have pointed features and a sharp-angled contour. An implicit perception of threat represented by sharp objects, in humans, was hypothesized to explain this bias. METHOD: The study adopted a within-subject experimental design, where 36 subjects (representing three age-groups and both sexes) were exposed to a randomized order of 312 real-life images (objects, interiors, exteriors, landscape, and a set of control images). Amygdala activation was simultaneously captured using functional magnetic resonance imaging technology. Subjects' preference (like/dislike) data were also collected while in the scanner. Data were collected in 2013. RESULTS: In case of images depicting landscape and healthcare objects, brain scans show significant higher amygdala activation associated with sharp contours. However, in relation to images depicting hospital interiors and exterior envelops, brain scans show significant higher amygdala activation associated with curve contours. These activations pertain to exposure during the precognitive stages of the subjects' perception. CONCLUSION: Hospital forms do have systematic impact on fear response during precognitive stages of human perception. Whether this first impression colors the subsequent experience of an actual patient with real illness or injury is unknown.",1
"In home-care situations, the caring family members of people suffering from dementia are exposed to a great number of physical, mental and social burdens, and restrictions, putting themselves at risk of falling ill. Caring family members need adequate forms of relief in order to be able to care for the family  member at home for as long as possible, and with the best possible physical and psychological status. In the present paper, interventions of relief and promotion and their effects on family members caring for dementia patients have been investigated and described on the basis of a systematic literature review. The presentation of the results shows that psycho-educational, relieving, supportive, psychotherapeutic and multimodal offers as well as counselling and case/care management among caring family members have significant effects on parameters such as burdens, level of depression, subjective well-being, skills/knowledge as  well as symptoms and institutionalisation of the person in need of care. None of  the interventions investigated, however, covers the entire range of parameters. In order to be able to ensure the individual support of caring family members, a  superordinate organisational concept (case/care management, family health nursing) which meets the needs of the caring family members, combines and interlinks tailor-made offers for caring family members is required. Registered nurses could play a central role as care managers or family health nurses in ensuring home-based care for people with dementia. Further investigations on multimodal offers and case/care management are needed. In this context, it is essential to take well-considered decisions on study design, sample size, and result parameters (assessment instruments) in order to gain significant results and homogeneous data.",0
"OBJECTIVES: To explore whether baseline scores on the Mobility Assessment Tool-short form (MAT-sf), a brief, animated, computer-based means of assessing mobility that predicts mobility disability, are associated with number of hospitalizations and time to first hospitalization over a median follow-up of 2.7 years. DESIGN: Post hoc analysis of prospectively gathered data from the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) Study, a randomized clinical trial of lifestyle interventions to preserve mobility in older adults. SETTING: Eight U.S. academic medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: Of 1,635 sedentary community-dwelling older adults enrolled in LIFE, 1,574 completed baseline physical function screening including the MAT-sf,  with baseline scores ranging from 30.2 (low function) to 69.8 (high function) on  a scale from 30 to 80. MEASUREMENTS: Number of hospitalizations and time to first hospitalization, adjusted for age, sex, race, living alone, clinical site, baseline comorbidities, number of prescription medications, and cognition. RESULTS: Of the 1,557 participants with data regarding hospitalization status, 726 (47%) had at least 1 hospitalization; 78% of these had 1 or 2 hospitalizations. For every 10-point lower MAT-sf score, the rate of all hospitalizations was 19% higher in those with lower scores (adjusted rate ratio=1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.08-1.32, p<.001). Lower baseline MAT-sf scores were also associated with greater risk of first hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio=1.20, 95% CI=1.09-1.32, p<.01, per 10-point lower MAT-sf score). CONCLUSION: Low MAT-sf scores identify older adults at risk of hospitalization; further study is needed to test interventions to reduce hospitalizations in these individuals.",0
"Craving is thought to be a specific desire state that biases choice toward the desired object, be it chocolate or drugs. A vast majority of people report having experienced craving of some kind. In its pathological form craving contributes to health outcomes in addiction and obesity. Yet despite its ubiquity and clinical relevance we still lack a basic neurocomputational understanding of craving. Here, using an instantaneous measure of subjective valuation and selective cue exposure, we identify a behavioral signature of a food craving-like state and advance a computational framework for understanding how this state might transform valuation to bias choice. We find desire induced by exposure to a specific high-calorie, high-fat/sugar snack good is expressed in subjects' momentary willingness to pay for this good. This effect is selective but not exclusive to the exposed good; rather, we find it generalizes to nonexposed goods in proportion to their subjective attribute similarity to the exposed ones. A second manipulation of reward size (number of snack units available for purchase) further suggested that a multiplicative gain mechanism supports the transformation of valuation during laboratory craving. These findings help explain how real-world food craving can result in behaviors inconsistent with preferences expressed in the absence of craving and open a path for the computational modeling of craving-like phenomena using a simple and repeatable experimental tool for assessing subjective states in economic terms.",0
"After choosing between uncertain options, one might get feedback on both the outcome of the chosen option and the outcome of the unchosen option (the alternative). Behavioral research has shown that in such cases people engage in outcome comparison, and that the alternative outcome influences the way one evaluates his own received outcome. Moreover, this influence differs whether one  was responsible or not for the choice made. In two studies, we looked for the electrophysiological correlates of outcome comparison. Subjects chose one of two  boxes shown on the screen, each box contained a gain or a loss. The alternative outcome was always revealed first, followed by the received outcome. In half of the trials the software picked one box instead of subjects. We tested whether the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the P3 elicited by the received reflect outcome comparison. As expected, we found that the FRN and P3 were more positive  when the received outcome was a gain (vs. a loss). The FRN and P3 were also sensitive to the value of the alternative outcome, but contrary to our predictions, they were more positive when the alternative outcome was a gain (vs. a loss). As the FRN and P3 are sensitive to expectations, we hypothesized that our findings might result from subjects' biased expectations: subjects might have wrongly believed that a good (bad) alternative outcome signaled a bad (good) received outcome. This hypothesis, coined as the Alternative Omen Effect, was confirmed in parallel in a series of behavioral experiments: people see an illusory negative correlation between the uncorrelated outcomes of choice options (reported in Marciano-Romm et al. (2016)). A challenge for future research will be to disentangle the effects of expectation from those of outcome comparison.",0
"Learned safety, a learning process in which a cue becomes associated with the absence of threat, is disrupted in individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A bi-directional relationship exists between smoking and PTSD and one potential explanation is that nicotine-associated changes in cognition facilitate PTSD emotional dysregulation by disrupting safety associations. Therefore, we investigated whether nicotine would disrupt learned safety by enhancing fear associated with a safety cue. In the present study, C57BL/6 mice were administered acute or chronic nicotine and trained over three days in a differential backward trace conditioning paradigm consisting of five trials of a forward conditioned stimulus (CS)+ (Light) co-terminating with a footshock unconditioned stimulus followed by a backward CS- (Tone) presented 20 s after cessation of the unconditioned stimulus. Summation testing found that acute nicotine disrupted learned safety, but chronic nicotine had no effect. Another group of animals administered acute nicotine showed fear when presented with the backward CS (Light) alone, indicating the formation of a maladaptive fear association with the backward CS. Finally, we investigated the brain regions involved by administering nicotine directly into the dorsal hippocampus, ventral hippocampus, and prelimbic cortex. Infusion of nicotine into the dorsal hippocampus disrupted safety learning.",1
"OBJECTIVES: We investigated mental disorders, suicidal ideation, self-perceived need for treatment, and mental health service utilization attributable to exposure to peacekeeping and combat operations among Canadian military personnel. METHODS: With data from the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 1.2 Canadian Forces Supplement, a cross-sectional population-based survey of active Canadian military personnel (N = 8441), we estimated population attributable fractions (PAFs) of adverse mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Exposure to either combat or peacekeeping operations was associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (men: PAF = 46.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 27.3, 62.7; women: PAF = 23.6%; 95% CI = 9.2, 40.1), 1 or more mental disorder assessed in the survey (men: PAF = 9.3%; 95% CI = 0.4, 18.1; women: PAF = 6.1%; 95% CI = 0.0, 13.4), and a perceived need for information (men: PAF = 12.3%; 95%  CI = 4.1, 20.6; women: PAF = 7.9%; 95% CI = 1.3, 15.5). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion, but not the majority, of mental health-related outcomes were attributable to combat or peacekeeping deployment. Future studies should assess traumatic events and their association with physical injury during deployment, premilitary factors, and postdeployment psychosocial factors that may influence soldiers' mental health.",0
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the reduction in phantom pain and sensation with combined  training of progressive muscle relaxation, mental imagery, and phantom exercises. DESIGN: Randomized controlled prospective trial with 2 parallel groups. SETTING: Amputee unit of a rehabilitation hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects with unilateral lower limb amputation (N=51) with phantom  limb pain (PLP) and/or phantom limb sensation (PLS). INTERVENTIONS: The experimental group performed combined training of progressive  muscle relaxation, mental imagery, and phantom exercises 2 times/wk for 4 weeks,  whereas the control group had the same amount of physical therapy dedicated to the residual limb. No pharmacological intervention was initiated during the trial period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire and the Brief Pain Inventory were used to evaluate changes over time in different aspects (intensity, rate, duration, and bother) of PLS and PLP. Blind evaluations were performed before and after treatment and after 1-month follow-up. RESULTS: The experimental group showed a significant decrease over time in all the Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire domains (in terms of both PLS and PLP; P<.04 for both) and the Brief Pain Inventory (P<.03). No statistically significant changes were observed in the control group. Between-group analyses showed a significant reduction in intensity (average and worst pain) and bother of PLP and rate and bother of PLS at follow-up evaluation, 1 month after the end  of the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Combined training of progressive muscle relaxation, mental imagery,  and modified phantom exercises should be taken into account as a valuable technique to reduce phantom limb pain and sensation.",0
"BACKGROUND: Older persons often have multiple health and social problems and need a variety of health services. A coordinated preventive approach that integrates the provision of health and social care services could promote healthy ageing. Such an approach can be organised differently, depending on the availability and  organizational structures in the local context. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of a coordinated preventive care approach in various European settings. OBJECTIVES: This study explored the effects of a coordinated preventive health and social care approach on the lifestyle, health and quality of life of community-dwelling older persons in five European cities. DESIGN: International multi-center pre-post controlled trial. SETTING: Community settings in cities in the United Kingdom, Greece, Croatia, the Netherlands and Spain. PARTICIPANTS: 1844 community-dwelling older persons (mean age = 79.5; SD = 5.6). METHODS: The Urban Health Centres Europe (UHCE) approach consisted of a preventive multidimensional health assessment and, if a person was at-risk, coordinated care-pathways targeted at fall risk, appropriate medication use, loneliness and frailty. Intervention and control sites were chosen based on their location in distinct neighbourhoods in the participating cities. Persons in the catchment area of the intervention sites 'the intervention group' received the UHCE approach and persons in catchment areas of the control sites 'the control group' received care as usual. A questionnaire and two measurements were taken at baseline and at one-year follow-up to assess healthy lifestyle, fall risk, appropriate medication use, loneliness level, frailty, level of independence, health-related quality of life and care use. To evaluate differences in outcomes  between intervention group and control group for the total study population, for  those who received follow-up care-pathways and for each city separately (multilevel) logistic and linear regression analyses were used. RESULTS: Persons in the intervention group had less recurrent falls (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.48; 0.88) and lower frailty (B=-0.43, 95% CI= -0.65 to -0.22) at follow-up compared with persons in the control group. Physical health-related quality of life and mental well-being was better (B = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.14-1.76; and B = 1.50; 95% CI = 0.15-2.84 respectively). The effects of the UHCE approach  were stronger in the subgroup of persons (53.6%) enrolled in care-pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found promising but minor effects for the use of a coordinated preventive health and social care approach for the promotion of healthy ageing of older persons. Future studies should further evaluate effects of coordinated preventive health and social care aimed at healthy ageing. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN registry number is ISRCTN52788952. Date of registration is 13/03/2017.",0
"Cognitive theories of anxiety psychopathology cite biased attention towards threat as a central vulnerability and maintaining factor. However, many studies have found threat bias indices to have poor reliability and have failed to observe the theorized relationship between threat bias and anxiety symptoms; this may be due to the non-unitary nature of threat bias and the influence of state-level variables on its expression. Accumulating data suggests that state anxious mood is important for the robust expression of threat bias and for relations to emerge between threat bias and symptoms, though this possibility has not been experimentally tested. Eye-tracking was used to assess multiple forms of threat bias (i.e., early vigilance, sustained attention, facilitated engagement, delayed disengagement) thought to be related to anxiety. A non-clinical sample (N = 165) was recruited to test the hypothesis that biased attention towards threat, but not dysphoric or positive emotional stimuli, during an anxious mood induction, but not at a pre-stress baseline, would prospectively predict greater worry symptoms on days in which more naturalistic stressors occurred. Results revealed the hypothesized moderation effect for sustained attention towards threat after the mood induction but not at baseline, though sustained attention towards dysphoric stimuli also moderated the effect of stressors on worry. Worry-relevant sustained attention towards negative emotional stimuli may be a partially mood-context dependent phenomenon.",1
"BACKGROUND: Patients' perception of psychiatric healthcare is a critical indicator in measuring service quality. The aim of the study was to determine patient's level of satisfaction with the quality of health care delivered at the  inpatient departments, and to identify the service quality factors that were important to patients. METHOD: The Satisfaction with Psychiatry Care Questionnaire-22 was administered to 125 consecutive inpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in a stable condition. Sociodemographic and background variables, illness and symptom  severity, insight, social anhedonia, self-esteem, perceived social support, and satisfaction with quality of life were collected. RESULTS: Although the participants generally expressed satisfaction with the inpatient services, they indicated that the weakest aspects of the service were in the domains of 'personal experience', 'information' and 'activity'. Women were significantly more dissatisfied than men with 'staff', 'care', and by general satisfaction. Multiple regression analysis revealed that satisfaction with hospital health care was associated with five indicators: insight, satisfaction with physical health, self-efficacy, family support, and social anhedonia. CONCLUSION: Personality related factors rather than psychopathological symptoms were associated with a satisfaction with care of admitted patients with severe mental illness. These factors could be targets for interventions aimed to improve treatment and hospital services.",0
"Previous prospective studies assessing the relationship between circulating concentrations of vitamin D and prostate cancer risk have shown inconclusive results, particularly for risk of aggressive disease. In this study, we examine the association between prediagnostic concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] and the risk of prostate cancer overall and by tumor characteristics. Principal investigators of 19 prospective studies provided individual participant data on circulating 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D for up to 13,462 men with incident prostate cancer and 20,261 control participants. ORs for prostate cancer by study-specific fifths of season-standardized vitamin D concentration were estimated using multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic regression. 25(OH)D concentration was positively associated with risk for total prostate cancer (multivariable-adjusted OR comparing highest vs. lowest study-specific fifth was 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.31; P trend < 0.001). However, this association varied by disease aggressiveness (P heterogeneity = 0.014); higher circulating 25(OH)D was  associated with a higher risk of nonaggressive disease (OR per 80 percentile increase = 1.24, 1.13-1.36) but not with aggressive disease (defined as stage 4,  metastases, or prostate cancer death, 0.95, 0.78-1.15). 1,25(OH)2D concentration  was not associated with risk for prostate cancer overall or by tumor characteristics. The absence of an association of vitamin D with aggressive disease does not support the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency increases prostate cancer risk. Rather, the association of high circulating 25(OH)D concentration with a higher risk of nonaggressive prostate cancer may be influenced by detection bias. SIGNIFICANCE: This international collaboration comprises the largest prospective study on blood vitamin D and prostate cancer risk and shows no association with aggressive disease but some evidence of a higher risk of nonaggressive disease.",0
"The schema concept has had an important role in both early and more recent accounts of psychopathology. Schemas are underlying cognitive structures that are thought to create vulnerability to disorders, because they act as templates for the perception, encoding, storage, and retrieval of information. Recent approaches to the understanding and treatment of personality disorders give schemas particular prominence, and the concept of early maladaptive schemas forms the cornerstone of Young's (1999) schema-focused cognitive therapy. The aim of this paper is to examine the effect of mood on responses to the Young Schema Questionnaire--short form (YSQ-S; Young, 1998). A sample of 50 non-clinical participants completed the YSQ-S on three different occasions: in neutral mood, and following happy and depressed mood inductions. The results of 30 participants with full data sets showed that emotional deprivation and defectiveness scores increased after the depressed mood induction, whereas entitlement scores increased after the happy mood induction. The results are discussed in relation to cognitive theories of vulnerability to psychopathology, and future directions  for research are suggested.",0
"In Asia, like other regions, the circumstances for psychiatric care and rehabilitation impose various limitations on us. However, committed professionals have been creating innovative models of excellence, which are culturally appropriate and clinically effective. In this paper, seven innovative models of psychiatric care and rehabilitation are presented. The Nitte project in India provides a comprehensive free rural psychiatric service, while transforming the 'brain drain' problem to 'brain circulation' cooperation. Through Social Enterprises in Hong Kong recovered clients are trained and employed. Senior Peer  Counselling in Singapore emphasizes the relief of emotional distress by psychological methods and the primacy of communication in the healing or therapeutic relationship. Seoul Mental Health 2020, an epoch-making project in Korea, has increased the coverage rate of community mental health centres remarkably. Yuli Psychiatric Rehabilitation Model in Taiwan helps long-term inpatients to get reintegrated into the community. In Japan, models of excellence for community-based psychiatry have been developed at local government, hospital  and community/NGO levels. Chinese Psychiatry Online, an excellent website, provides public education, resource searching, self-testing and consultation services for the public along with various contents for professionals. We must disseminate information about models of excellence which provide great benefit to the people who suffer from psychiatric illness without high expenses.",0
"This study was performed to investigate the anxiolytic efficacy of silexan, a new oral lavender oil capsule preparation, in comparison to placebo in primary care.  In 27 general and psychiatric practices 221 adults suffering from anxiety disorder not otherwise specified (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders-IV 300.00 or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth revision F41.9) were randomized to 80 mg/day of a  defined, orally administered preparation from Lavandula species or placebo for 10 weeks with visits every 2 weeks. A Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) total score >or=18 and a total score >5 for the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were required. The primary outcome measures were HAMA and PSQI total score decrease between baseline and week 10. Secondary efficacy measures included the Clinical Global Impressions scale, the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale, and the SF-36 Health Survey Questionnaire. Patients treated with silexan showed a total score decrease by 16.0+/-8.3 points (mean+/-SD, 59.3%) for the HAMA and by 5.5+/-4.4 points (44.7%) for the PSQI compared to 9.5+/-9.1 (35.4%) and 3.8+/-4.1 points (30.9%) in the placebo group (P<0.01 one-sided, intention to treat). Silexan was  superior to placebo regarding the percentage of responders (76.9 vs. 49.1%, P<0.001) and remitters (60.6 vs. 42.6%, P=0.009). Lavandula oil preparation had a significant beneficial influence on quality and duration of sleep and improved general mental and physical health without causing any unwanted sedative or other drug specific effects. Lavandula oil preparation silexan is both efficacious and  safe for the relief of anxiety disorder not otherwise specified. It has a clinically meaningful anxiolytic effect and alleviates anxiety related disturbed  sleep.",0
"BACKGROUND: Identifying and controlling systemic arterial blood pressure is important in young people, and it is possible to reduce the frequency of systemic arterial hypertension by improving the lifestyle. AIM: The aim of the study is to assess the relationship between healthy lifestyle behaviors and systemic blood pressure in university students. MATERIALS: The study sample consisted of 200 university students from a state university in Edirne. Lifestyles and habits were evaluated with Health Promotion  Lifestyle Profile II. Students' blood pressure was measured from both arms twice. RESULTS: The mean HPLP-II score of those who frequently feel good was significantly higher than those who rarely feel good. The mean score of those who frequently wake up between 06:00-09:00 in the morning was statistically significantly higher than those who wake up outside these hours. Those who perform social or artistic activities during their leisure times had a mean scale score higher than those who don't perform. Although there wasn't a statistically  significant difference according to smoking status, the mean score of non-smokers was higher than smokers. The mean scale scores were higher in frequent salt users than non-frequent users; participants with low saturated fatty acid intake had higher scores than those with high intake, and rare fast food consumers had higher scores than frequent consumers. The statistically significant difference between blood pressure values of females and males was due to higher blood pressure in male students. Those working in a part-time job had higher blood pressure values than those who weren't working. Among the students whose body mass indexes could be evaluated, there were differences in blood pressure values. CONCLUSION: It has been observed in our study that health-related responsibilities and lifestyle behaviours increase with better leisure time activities, improved eating habits and a positive outlook on life. Turning youngs' tendencies towards healthy lifestyle behaviours to habits can make them healthier, more collective and more productive regarding physical, social and psychological well-being.",0
"BACKGROUND: Patients with delirium have increased risk of death, dementia and institutionalization, and prognosis differs between delirium motor subtypes. A few studies have identified associations between environmental factors like room-transfers and time spent in the emergency department (ED) and delirium, but  no studies have investigated if environmental factors may influence delirium motor subtypes. We wanted to explore if potentially stressful events like ward-transfers, arriving ED at nighttime, time spent in ED and nigthttime investigations were associated with development of delirium (incident delirium) and delirium motor subtypes. METHODS: We used the DSM-5 criteria to diagnose delirium and the Delirium Motor Subtype Scale for motor subtyping. We defined hyperactive and mixed delirium as delirium with hyperactive symptoms, and hypoactive and no-subtype delirium as delirium without hyperactive symptoms. We registered ward-transfers, time of arrival in ED, time spent in ED and nighttime investigations (8 p.m. to 8 a.m.),  and calculated Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) and Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) to adjust for cognitive impairment and comorbidity. We used logistic regression analyses with incident delirium and delirium with hyperactive symptoms as outcome variables, and ward-transfers, arriving ED at nighttime, time spent in ED and nighttime investigations as exposure variables, adjusting for age, GDS and CIRS in the analyses for incident delirium. RESULTS: We included 254 patients, mean age 86.1 years (SD 5.2), 49 (19.3%) had incident delirium, 22 with and 27 without hyperactive symptoms. There was a significant association between nighttime investigations and incident delirium in both the unadjusted (odds ratio (OR) 2.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 4.22, p = 0.015) and the multiadjusted model (OR 2.61, CI 1.26 to 5.40, p = 0.010). There were no associations between any other exposure variables and incident delirium. No exposure variables were associated with delirium motor subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Nighttime investigations were associated with incident delirium, even after adjusting for age, cognitive impairment and comorbidity. We cannot out rule that the medical condition leading to nighttime investigations is the true delirium-trigger, so geriatric patients must still receive emergency investigations at nighttime. Hospital environment in broad sense may be a target  for delirium prevention.",0
"Developing novel therapeutics for bipolar disorder (BD) has been hampered by limited mechanistic knowledge how sufferers switch between mania and depression-how the same brain can switch between extreme states-described as the  ""holy grail"" of BD research. Strong evidence implicates seasonally-induced switching between states, with mania associated with summer-onset, depression with winter-onset. Determining mechanisms of and sensitivity to such switching is required. C57BL/6J and dopamine transporter hypomorphic (DAT-HY 50% expression) mice performed a battery of psychiatry-relevant behavioral tasks following 2-week housing in chambers under seasonally relevant photoperiod extremes. Summer-like and winter-like photoperiod exposure induced mania-relevant and depression-relevant behaviors respectively in mice. This behavioral switch paralleled neurotransmitter switching from dopamine to somatostatin in hypothalamic neurons (receiving direct input from the photoperiod-processing center, the suprachiasmatic nucleus). Mice with reduced DAT expression exhibited  hypersensitivity to these summer-like and winter-like photoperiods, including more extreme mania-relevant (including reward sensitivity during reinforcement learning), and depression-relevant (including punishment-sensitivity and loss-sensitivity during reinforcement learning) behaviors. DAT mRNA levels switched in wildtype littermate mice across photoperiods, an effect not replicated in DAT hypomorphic mice. This inability to adjust DAT levels to match  photoperiod-induced neurotransmitter switching as a homeostatic control likely contributes to the susceptibility of DAT hypormophic mice to these switching photoperiods. These data reveal the potential contribution of photoperiod-induced neuroplasticity within an identified circuit of the hypothalamus, linked with reduced DAT function, underlying switching between states in BD. Further investigations of the circuit will likely identify novel therapeutic targets to block switching between states.",0
"The present study examined whether endorsing a felt-age that is extremely divergent from one's actual age (whether older or younger) is related to worse functioning four years later. Data were drawn from 4938 participants, who completed the 2008 and 2012 questionnaires of the Health-and-Retirement-Study (HRS). Participants were divided into four groups according to their reported proportional-felt-age: the normative-young (N = 2229), reported a normative felt-age at the median or younger; normative-old (N = 2226), reported normative felt-age at the median and older; and the extremely young and extremely old proportional-felt-age (upper and lower 5% of felt-age; N's = 242 and 241, respectively). These groups were compared on chronic medical conditions, depressive symptoms, activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), functional limitations, and loneliness. While extremely younger proportional-felt-age participants did not reveal worse (or better) outcomes compared with the normative-young group, extremely old proportional-felt-age participants reported worse physical health, mental health, and functioning in cross-sectional, as well as longitudinal comparisons. Extreme  values of older proportional-felt-age are usually not reported randomly and reflect less adaptive adjustment. The findings underscore the importance of studying participants at the extreme values of felt-age, especially extreme old proportional-felt-age, and the need for further inspection of the mechanisms underlying these evaluations.",0
"BACKGROUND: Tic disorders, such as the Gilles de la Tourette syndrome and persistent tic disorder, are neurodevelopmental movement disorders involving impaired motor control. Hence, patients show repetitive unwanted muscular contractions in one or more parts of the body. A cognitive-behavioral therapy, with a particular emphasis on the psychophysiology of tic expression and sensorimotor activation, can reduce the frequency and intensity of tics. However, its impact on motor activation and inhibition is not fully understood. METHODS: To study the effects of a cognitive-behavioral therapy on electrocortical activation, we recorded the event-related potentials (ERP) and lateralized readiness potentials (LRP), before and after treatment, of 20 patients with tic disorders and 20 healthy control participants (matched on age,  sex and intelligence), during a stimulus-response compatibility inhibition task.  The cognitive-behavioral therapy included informational, awareness training, relaxation, muscle discrimination, cognitive restructuration and relapse prevention strategies. RESULTS: Our results revealed that prior to treatment; tic patients had delayed stimulus-locked LRP onset latency, larger response-locked LRP peak amplitude, and a frontal overactivation during stimulus inhibition processing. Both stimulus-locked LRP onset latency and response-locked LRP peak amplitude normalized after the cognitive behavioral therapy completion. However, the frontal overactivation related to inhibition remained unchanged following therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that P300 and reaction times are sensitive to stimulus-response compatibility, but are not related to tic symptoms. Secondly, overactivity of the frontal LPC and impulsivity in TD patients were not affected  by treatment. Finally, CBT had normalizing effects on the activation of the pre-motor and motor cortex in TD patients. These results imply specific modifications of motor processes following therapy, while inhibition processes remained unchanged. Given that LRPs are partially generated within the sensorimotor and supplementary motor area, the reported reduction in tic frequency and improvements of LRPs components suggest that CBT induced a physiological change in patients' motor area.",0
"AIMS OF THE STUDY: Previous studies have shown that event-related potentials (ERPs) are modulated by anxiety or psychopathic personality traits. Therefore, we hypothesized that the automatic processing of facial expressions of emotions (FEE) is also correlated with related disordered personality traits. METHODS: Thirty-seven healthy volunteers underwent both an ""oddball"" ERP recording to facial expressions of Anger, Happiness, Sadness, and Neutral, and a  test of the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology (DAPP). RESULTS: Mean reaction time was longer in response to anger than to other facial  expressions. Facial expressions of Anger, Happiness and Sadness did not affect N1 (N170). By contrast, Happiness elicited a delayed P2, Anger elicited both a smaller N2 and a delayed P3b, and both Happiness and Anger elicited a P3b of higher amplitude. In addition, P3a latencies to Happiness were negatively correlated with DAPP Identity problems, and P3b latencies to Happiness were negatively correlated with DAPP Stimulus seeking, Callousness, Passive aggressivity, and Narcissism. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that Anger implicitly captures attentional resources, and Happiness triggers more facilitated processing in individuals with dissocial traits.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Life-threatening danger is assumed to produce, in tandem, increases in both vigilance toward threat and stress-related symptoms, but no data test the validity of this assumption. The authors examined associations, in real time, among imminent life-threatening danger, stress-related symptoms, and vigilance. METHOD: Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety were measured in a civilian population (N=131) as a function of war-related stress, operationalized as the time available for seeking cover from rocket attack. A computerized measure of threat-related vigilance using a classic dot-probe attention task was also collected. RESULTS: PTSD symptoms, depression, and anxiety increased as a function of war-related threat. Acute proximal threat was associated with avoidance of, rather than vigilance toward, negative valence information. For participants within rocket range, the magnitude of threat bias varied with the magnitude of distress symptoms, such that as bias away from threat increased, distress symptoms increased. CONCLUSIONS: These data challenge current thinking about the role of attention in stress responding. Attentional threat avoidance may reduce the acute impact of imminent threat, but this may come at a price in terms of an elevated risk for psychopathology.",1
"Exposure to a deadly threat, an adult male rat, induced the release of corticosterone in 14-day-old rat pups. The endocrine stress response was decreased when the pups were reunited with their mother immediately after exposure. These findings demonstrate that social variables can reduce the consequences of an aversive experience.",1
"The NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative aims to describe key dimensional constructs underlying mental function across multiple units of analysis-from genes to observable behaviors-in order to better understand psychopathology. The acute threat (""fear"") construct of the RDoC Negative Valence System has been studied extensively from a translational perspective, and is highly pertinent to numerous psychiatric conditions, including anxiety and trauma-related disorders. We examined genetic contributions to the construct of acute threat at two units of analysis within the RDoC framework: (1) neural circuits and (2) physiology. Specifically, we focused on genetic influences on activation patterns of frontolimbic neural circuitry and on startle, skin conductance, and heart rate responses. Research on the heritability of activation in threat-related frontolimbic neural circuitry is lacking, but physiological indicators of acute threat have been found to be moderately heritable (35-50%). Genetic studies of the neural circuitry and physiology of acute threat have almost exclusively relied on the candidate gene method and, as in the broader psychiatric genetics literature, most findings have failed to replicate. The most robust support has been demonstrated for associations between variation in the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genes with threat-related neural activation and physiological responses. However, unbiased genome-wide approaches using very large samples are needed for gene discovery, and these can be accomplished with collaborative consortium-based research efforts, such as those of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) and Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium.",1
"Converging evidence for an essential function of the lateral hypothalamus (LHA) in the control of feeding behavior has been accumulating since the classic work conducted almost 80 years ago. The LHA is also important in reward and reinforcement processes and behavioral state control. A unifying function for the LHA across these processes has not been fully established. Nonetheless, it is considered to integrate motivation with behavior. More recent work has demonstrated that the LHA is also required when cognitive processes, such as associative learning and memory control feeding behavior, suggesting it may serve as a motivation-cognition interface. Structurally, the LHA is well positioned within the cerebral hemisphere, with its extensive connectional network across the forebrain-brainstem axis, to link motivational and behavioral systems with cognitive processes. Studies that examined how learned cues control food seeking  and consumption have implicated the LHA, but due to methodological limitations could not determine whether it underlies motivation, learning, or the integration of these processes. Furthermore, the identification of specific substrates has been limited by the LHA's extraordinary complexity and heterogeneity. Recent methodological advancements with chemo-and opto-genetic approaches have enabled unprecedented specificity in interrogations of distinct neurons and their pathways in behaving animals, including manipulations during temporally distinct  events. These approaches have revealed novel insights about the LHA structure and function. Recent findings that the GABA LHA neurons control feeding and food-reward learning and memory will be reviewed together with past work within the context of the LHA function as an interface between cognition and motivation.",0
"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that greater global and situational relationship satisfaction would reduce the negative impact of threatening information on acute pain. DESIGN: An experimental design was used to manipulate threat and elicit acute pain via a cold pressor task. SETTING: The study was completed in a research laboratory at a large urban university in the Midwestern USA. SUBJECTS: Participants were 134 couples, in which at least one individual was an undergraduate student. METHODS: After administration of a global relationship satisfaction measure, couples were randomly assigned to either receive high or low threatening information about the painful task. Following the threat manipulation, couples discussed the upcoming task and rated their satisfaction with the interaction (i.e., situational relationship satisfaction). The designated pain participant then completed the painful task alone. RESULTS: The threat manipulation altered couples' perceived threat of pain. Situational relationship satisfaction moderated the effect of threat on pain trajectories such that situational relationship satisfaction predicted less pain intensity at an earlier point in the task for the low threat condition than the high threat condition. Greater global relationship satisfaction predicted greater likelihood of task completion among those in the low threat condition, whereas it was unrelated to task completion in the high threat condition. Greater global relationship satisfaction also predicted lower pain intensity throughout the task. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that the interpersonal context is independently related to acute pain and may also alter the effect of threatening information on acute pain.",1
"Serotonin reuptake inhibitors may increase symptoms of anxiety immediately following treatment initiation. The present study examined whether acute citalopram increased fear-potentiated startle to predictable and/or unpredictable shocks in healthy subjects. Eighteen healthy subjects each received two treatments, placebo and 20 mg citalopram in a crossover design. Participants were exposed to three conditions including one in which predictable aversive shocks were signaled by a cue, a second in which unpredictable shocks were anticipated, and a third in which no shocks were administered. Changes in aversive states were investigated using acoustic startle stimuli. Citalopram did not affect baseline startle. However, the phasic startle potentiation to the threat cue in the predictable condition was robustly increased by acute citalopram. The sustained startle potentiation in the unpredictable conditions was also increased by citalopram, but only when the drug was given during the first session. These results indicate that a single dose of citalopram is not anxiogenic in itself, but can exacerbate the expression of fear and anxiety.",1
"Recent findings obtained in patients with phobias or trauma-related anxiety disorders raise doubts concerning the interrelation between acute fear relief during an exposure-based therapeutic session and beneficial treatment progress. In a mouse model explicit for exposure therapy, we challenge the view that within-session fear reduction is the turning point for relearning of a stimulus-threat association. Even though within-session extinction of auditory-cued fear memory was identical for prolonged and spaced tone presentations, only the latter caused between-session extinction. Furthermore, spaced tone presentations led to between-session extinction even in the complete absence of within-session extinction, as observed for remote fear memories and in case of abolished cannabinoid receptor type 1 signaling. Induction of between-session extinction was accompanied by an increase in the number of c-Fos-positive neurons within the basolateral amygdala, the cingulate cortex, and the dentate gyrus, independent of the level of within-session extinction. Together, our findings demonstrate that within-session extinction is neither sufficient nor essential for between-session extinction, thus calling for a reconsideration of current concepts underlying exposure-based therapies.",1
"Music has soothed the souls of human beings for ages. It also has helped people recover from ailments since ancient times. Today, there is a widespread interest  in the use of music therapy in treating psychiatric disorders. This article describes the various types of music therapy in use today and also offers insight into how music therapy can be incorporated into the management of psychiatric disorders and as an element of psychotherapy.",0
"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has in some cases been associated with significant psychological effects and/or personality change. These effects occur sometimes as acute changes experienced intraoperatively or during the initial setting of the stimulator and sometimes as longer term progressive changes in the months following surgery. Sometimes they are the intended outcome of treatment, and in other cases they are an unintended side-effect. In all of these circumstances some patients and caregivers have described the psychological effects of DBS as frightening or disconcerting. I trace the source of these negative reactions to the fear that stimulation-related psychological and personality changes represent a threat to personal identity and agency. This issue has implications both for philosophical theories of personal identity and agency and for clinical concerns. A narrative account of personal identity is developed to illuminate the nature of the threat to identity and agency DBS potentially poses, and to suggest steps that might be taken to mitigate and avoid these threats.",1
"Persons with intellectual disabilities record a higher incidence of challenging behaviours than the general population. Massage therapy has frequently been applied to such persons to induce relaxation. The aim of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of massage therapy on relaxation and reduction of challenging behaviours. A literature search was conducted through various electronic databases; a total of 64 articles was generated but only seven met all inclusion criteria. These studies were evaluated in terms of (a) number of participants, (b) study setting, (c) methodology, (d) intervention pattern, (e) outcome measure of the intervention, and (f) major results. Evidence-based literature demonstrating the effectiveness of massage therapy in supporting clinical practice is extremely limited. Case study designs, large amounts of qualitative data and small sample sizes meant that the therapeutic effect of massage therapy could not be substantiated. Hence, future studies with randomized clinical trials or of experimental design are recommended.",0
"The ability to adaptively regulate responses to the proximity of potential danger is critical to survival and imbalance in this system may contribute to psychopathology. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is implicated in defensive responding during uncertain threat anticipation whereas the amygdala may drive responding upon more acute danger. This functional dissociation between the BNST and amygdala is however controversial, and human evidence scarce. Here we used data from two independent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies [n = 108 males and n = 70 (45 females)] to probe how coordination between the BNST and amygdala may regulate responses during shock anticipation and actual shock confrontation. In a subset of participants from Sample 2 (n = 48) we demonstrate that anticipation and confrontation evoke bradycardic and tachycardic responses, respectively. Further, we show that in each sample when going from shock anticipation to the moment of shock confrontation neural activity shifted from a region anatomically consistent with the BNST toward the amygdala. Comparisons of functional connectivity during threat processing showed overlapping yet also consistently divergent functional connectivity profiles for the BNST and amygdala. Finally, childhood maltreatment levels predicted amygdala, but not BNST, hyperactivity during shock anticipation. Our results support an evolutionary conserved, defensive distance-dependent dynamic balance between BNST and amygdala activity. Shifts in this balance may enable shifts in defensive reactions via the demonstrated differential functional connectivity. Our results indicate that early life stress may tip the neural balance toward acute threat responding and via that route predispose for affective disorder.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Previously proposed differential contributions of the BNST and amygdala to fear and anxiety have been recently debated. Despite the significance of understanding their contributions to defensive reactions, there is a paucity of human studies that directly compared these regions on activity and connectivity during threat processing. We show strong evidence for a dissociable role of the BNST and amygdala in threat processing by demonstrating in two large participant samples that they show a distinct temporal signature of threat responding as well as a discriminable pattern of functional connections and differential sensitivity to early life threat.",1
"Dopaminergic medication can induce severe addictive behaviours (e.g., pathological gambling) in susceptible Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. It is still unknown which particular neurocognitive processes become exacerbated or dysfunctional in PD patients with addictive behaviours. We sought to systematically review the relevant literature to identity potential neurocognitive correlates of medication-induced addictive behaviours in PD. We framed our review around neurocognitive processes central to four dominant accounts of substance addiction: 'aberrant learning', 'incentive sensitization',  'impulsivity to compulsivity' and 'impaired response inhibition and salience attribution'. Searches of the PubMed and Scopus databases were completed on June  23, 2017. To be included, studies were required to involve: (a) medicated PD patients, without a history of deep brain stimulation, with and without addictive behaviours; (b) a reward-related or decision-making task; and (c) statistical comparison of addictive and non-addictive groups' 'on' medication performance on  the task(s). Studies were summarised qualitatively with statistically significant (p<.05) group differences and effect sizes (Cohen's d) highlighted. 35 studies were included. Findings showed that the extant literature is highly heterogeneous. The domains of reward and punishment learning, reflection impulsivity and disadvantageous decision-making exemplify this. More homogeneity  exists in domains in which (a) neurocognitive dysfunction is not apparent (motor  control, cognitive/attentional flexibility and cognitive control) or (b) typical  neurocognitive processes appear exacerbated by medication (reward motivation and  choice impulsivity). Future large-scale neurocognitive studies are still required to develop our scientific understanding of addictive behaviours in PD and aid their clinical treatment and prediction.",0
"Fear promotes adaptive responses to threats. However, when the level of fear is not proportional to the level of threat, maladaptive fear-related behaviors characteristic of anxiety disorders result. Post-traumatic stress disorder develops in response to a traumatic event, and patients often show sensitized reactions to mild stressors associated with the trauma. Stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL) is a rodent model of this sensitized responding, in which exposure to a 15-shock stressor nonassociatively enhances subsequent fear conditioning training with only a single trial. We examined the role of corticosterone (CORT) in SEFL. Administration of the CORT synthesis blocker metyrapone prior to the stressor, but not at time points after, attenuated SEFL. Moreover, CORT co-administered with metyrapone rescued SEFL. However, CORT alone without the stressor was not sufficient to produce SEFL. In these same animals, we then looked for correlates of SEFL in terms of changes in excitatory receptor expression. Western blot analysis of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) revealed an increase in the GluA1 AMPA receptor subunit that correlated with SEFL. Thus, CORT is permissive to trauma-induced changes in BLA function.",1
"Why are trait extraversion and extraverted behaviors both associated with greater positive affect? Across 3 studies, we examined whether 2 aspects of social experience-perceived social contribution and social power-mediate the relation between extraversion and positive affect. Study 1 (N = 205) showed that trait measures of social contribution and power mediated the relation between trait extraversion and trait positive affect. Study 2 (N = 78) showed that state social contribution and power helped to explain the greater levels of state positive affect reported by participants who were instructed to enact extraverted behaviors. Finally, Study 3 (N = 62) showed that social contribution and power mediated the relation between natural fluctuations in extraverted behavior and positive affect states in daily life. In all 3 studies, multiple-mediator models  showed that social contribution, but not power, independently mediated the relations that trait and state extraversion had with positive affect. This suggests that perceptions of positive influence-more so than a general sense of power-help to explain why extraverts and extraverted moments are happier. We link these findings to emerging trends in the study of personality dynamics and the potential benefits of acting ""out of character."" (PsycINFO Database Record",0
"RATIONALE: In this study we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the effects of acute tryptophan depletion (ATD), a well-recognised method for inducing transient cerebral serotonin depletion, on brain activation to fearful faces. OBJECTIVES: We predicted that ATD would increase the responsiveness of the amygdala to fearful faces as a function of individual variation in threat sensitivity. METHODS: Twelve healthy male volunteers received a tryptophan depleting drink or a tryptophan balancing amino acid drink (placebo) in a double-blind crossover design. Five hours after drink ingestion participants were scanned whilst viewing fearful, happy and neutral faces. RESULTS: Consistent with previous findings, fearful faces induced significant signal change in the bilateral amygdala/hippocampus as well as the fusiform face area and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, ATD modulated amygdala/hippocampus activation in response to fearful relative to happy faces as a function of self-reported threat sensitivity (as measured with the Behavioral Inhibition Scale; Carver CS, White TL (1994) Behavioral inhibition, behavioral activation, and affective responses to impending reward and punishment: the BIS/BAS scales. J Pers Soc Psychol 67:319-333). CONCLUSION: The data support the hypothesis that individual variation in threat sensitivity interacts with manipulation of 5-HT function to bias the processing of amygdala-dependent threat-relevant stimuli.",1
"Serotonin is strongly implicated in the mammalian stress response, but surprisingly little is known about its mode of action. Recent data suggest that serotonin can inhibit aversive responding in humans, but this remains underspecified. In particular, data in rodents suggest that global serotonin depletion may specifically increase long-duration bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)-mediated aversive responses (ie, anxiety), but not short-duration BNST-independent responses (ie, fear). Here, we extend these findings to humans. In a balanced, placebo-controlled crossover design, healthy volunteers (n=20) received a controlled diet with and without the serotonin precursor tryptophan (acute tryptophan depletion; ATD). Aversive states were indexed by translational acoustic startle measures. Fear and anxiety were operationally defined as the increase in startle reactivity during short- and long-duration threat periods evoked by predictable shock (fear-potentiated startle) and by the context in which the shocks were administered (anxiety-potentiated startle), respectively. ATD significantly increased long-duration anxiety-potentiated startle but had no effect on short-duration fear-potentiated startle. These results suggest that serotonin depletion in humans selectively increases anxiety but not fear. Current translational frameworks support the proposition that ATD thus disinhibits dorsal raphe-originating serotonergic control of corticotropin-releasing hormone-mediated excitation of the BNST. This generates a candidate neuropharmacological mechanism by which depleted serotonin may increase response to sustained threats, alongside clear implications for our understanding of the manifestation and treatment of mood and anxiety disorders.",1
"Background: Individual Placement and Support (IPS) is an evidence-based practice  that helps persons with mental and/or physical disabilities, including spinal cord injury, find meaningful employment in the community. While employment is associated with positive rehabilitation outcomes, more research is needed on the  impact of IPS participation on non-vocational outcomes, particularly quality of life (QOL). Objective: To identity QOL outcomes experienced with (1) IPS participation and (2) IPS participation leading to employment. Methods: Using a mixed method design, data on quality of life outcomes were collected from 151 interviews and 213 surveys completed by veterans with SCI participating in IPS. Results: At 12 months, participants who obtained competitive employment (CE) and  those who did not (no-CE) showed improvement on most measures. In months 12-24, the CE group showed improvements on all study measures while the no-CE group declined on many indices. Statistically significant changes were observed between participants who obtained CE versus no-CE on several measures. Themes were identified from interview data related to productivity and well-being. Productivity themes were (1) contributing to society, (2) earning an income, and  (3) maintaining employment. Themes for well-being were (1) mental health/self-confidence, (2) physical health, and (3) goal setting. Themes were associated with IPS participation irrespective of employment outcomes. Conclusion: IPS participants who were competitively employed report consistent improvement in handicap, health-related QOL, and life satisfaction measures across time. Qualitative findings revealed improved QOL outcomes in productivity  and well-being for veterans participating in IPS overall, regardless of employment outcomes.",0
"This study aimed to identify the incidence and risk factors for the reduced functional capacity of community-dwelling elderly. A prospective, two-stage cohort study was conducted in 2011 and 2014. The study population consisted of 202 initially independent older adults for the basic activities of daily living.  The relative risk (RR) and its respective 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used as a measure of association and were estimated by log-binomial regression with robust variance. The incidence of lower functional capacity was 15.3%. The risk factors for the functional decline were unmarried status (RRadj = 2.75; 95%CI: 1.15-6.57) and depressive symptoms (RRadj = 2.41; 95%CI: 1.15-5.06), even after adjusting for gender, age group, per capita household income, diabetes, use of medication and level of physical activity. The high incidence of reduced functional capacity and its association with marital status and mental health aspects reveals the need to consider such factors in the planning of health actions aimed at maintaining and restoring the functional capacity of the seniors.",0
"Athletes today face a multitude of competing voices with health claims and products to enhance performance. This has led to both confusion and misconceptions about healthy dietary practices for athletes. Research has demonstrated that athletes do not understand the recommended nutritional requirements necessary for health. Further, improper study methods and research design can create and propagate misconceptions about how athletes view their own  health and personal sacrifices. These misconceptions not only influence attitudes and recommendations by healthcare providers and coaches but can also affect legislation. Healthcare providers, coaches and trainers have the opportunity to positively influence healthy nutritional lifestyles in athletes. Research has demonstrated that the balance of expert power and referent power have been shown  to emphasize personal empowerment and long term change.",0
"The study investigated the differences in pain perception in highly (Highs) and low (Lows) hypnotizable patients with chronic benign pain undergoing hypnotic suggestions of analgesia. Self reports of pain intensity were collected in different groups of fibromyalgic patients: (1) Highs and Lows during pre-hypnosis, neutral hypnosis, suggestions for analgesia, posthypnotic conditions; (2) Lows during suggestions for analgesia administered after a mental stress instead of neutral hypnosis; (3) healthy Lows receiving nociceptive stimulation during hypnotic relaxation and suggestions of analgesia. The results  showed that Highs and Lows differed in their response to suggestions, but significant analgesia was reported also by Lows. These individuals did not report any difference in pain perception between the sessions including mental stress and hypnotic relaxation. No change in pain perception was observed in healthy Lows during nociceptive stimulation associated with relaxation and suggestions for analgesia. In conclusion, the presence of chronic pain seems to be responsible for the paradoxical response of non hypnotizable patients to hypnotic suggestions.",0
"AIM: The aim of the present research is to clarify the nursing care conducted just before and after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945. METHODS: Five surviving nurses, who were registered nursing staff at that time in Hiroshima, offered to participate in this research. Individual interviews were conducted in order to obtain the information concerning the nursing activities in the disaster-stricken areas. The collected information was collated with the documents with regard to the atomic bombing in Hiroshima, and compared with the current studies concerning nursing in disaster. FINDINGS: The five nurses who participated in the study made it clear that, from  the day of the bombing, nursing care activities changed moment by moment according to the condition of the radiation victims, the stricken areas and the relief systems. Under these circumstances, the nurses tried to help the victims of the bombing by devising anything useful for nursing care. CONCLUSION: The research participants left their messages, pointing out that nurses' mental attitude to those in front of them as patients is one of the most  important things to keep in mind following any major disaster.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Qualitative research methods were used to understand the experiences of families seeking treatment for young people with recent-onset psychosis; such  knowledge can inform services design. METHODS: The authors conducted open-ended interviews in 1999 through 2002 with family members of 13 patients with recent-onset nonaffective psychotic disorders  in the New York metropolitan area, focusing on their experience in seeking treatment and engaging with mental health services. RESULTS: Family members described early lack of clarity of diagnosis and obstacles to obtaining treatment. Entry into the mental health system frequently  occurred in the context of crisis, with African-American families specifically reporting police involvement. Inpatient hospitalization was depicted as traumatic yet offering relief. Aftercare was described as fragmented, and issues with third-party payers were paramount. Families expressed a desire for more education, information, and support and described their struggles with stigma. These data from families are presented in the context of more recent literature as to the efficacy of specialized treatment programs for early stages of psychotic disorder and their involvement of families. CONCLUSIONS: These qualitative research data support the importance of involving  and educating families about psychosis: its recognition, its treatment, and access to services. They also highlight the need to address stigma and implement  structural changes in treatment that ensure continuity and coverage of care. Specialized first-episode psychosis services may address these issues, and they may minimize the traumatic experiences of involuntary hospitalization and police  involvement early in treatment.",0
"BACKGROUND: Leukemia and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) create physical, psychological, social, and spiritual distresses in patients. Understanding this threatening situation in adults with leukemia undergoing HSCT will assist health care professionals in providing holistic care to the patients. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was exploring the perceived threat in adults with leukemia undergoing HSCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This article is part of a longitudinal qualitative study which used the grounded theory approach and was conducted in 2009-2011. Ten adults with acute leukemia scheduled for HSCT were recruited from the Hematology-Oncology Research Center and Stem Cell Transplantation, Shariati Hospital in Tehran, Iran. A series of pre-transplant and post-transplant in-depth interviews were held in the hospital's HSCT wards. Totally, 18 interviews were conducted. Three written narratives were also obtained from the participants. The Corbin and Strauss approach was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Perceived threat was one of the main categories that emerged from the data. This category included four subcategories, ""inattention to the signs and symptoms"", ""doubt and anxiety"", ""perception of danger and time limitation"" and ""change of life conditions"", which occurred in linear progression over time. CONCLUSION: Suffering from leukemia and experiencing HSCT are events that are uniquely perceived by patients. This threatening situation can significantly effect perception of patients and cause temporary or permanent alterations in patients' lives. Health care professionals can help these patients by deeper understanding of their experiences and effective interventions.",1
"OBJECTIVE: To describe the implementation, main intervention areas and initial results of the Integrated Strategy for the Promotion of Healthy Eating (EIPAS) in Portugal. METHODS: EIPAS was published as a Law, in December of 2017, as a result of a collaboration between several ministries, including the Finance, Internal Affairs, Education, Health, Economy, Agriculture, and Sea Ministries, aiming at improving the dietary habits of the Portuguese population. The working group, led by the Ministry of Health, developed this strategy for over a year. The framework produced was based on WHO and European Commission recommendations as well as on relevant data from the last Portuguese dietary intake survey (2015/2016). EIPAS also reflects the results of a public hearing, including the food industry, among others, and the experience gathered, since 2012, through the National Programme for the Promotion of Healthy Eating. It considers the 'health in all policies' challenge set by WHO and has four different strategic areas, namely (1) creation  of healthier food environments, (2) improvement of the quality and accessibility  of healthy food choices for consumers, (3) promotion and development of literacy, in order to encourage healthy food choices, and (4) promotion of innovation and entrepreneurship. In order to achieve these goals, a set of 51 actions was established and assigned to the seven ministries involved. RESULTS: Under the scope of this strategy, Portugal has already implemented several actions, including (1) definition of standards for food availability at all public healthcare institutions; (2) implementation of a sugar tax on sweetened beverages; (3) implementation of a voluntary agreement with the food industry sector for food reformulation (work in progress); (4) design of a proposal for an interpretative model of front-of-pack food labelling; (5) improvement of the nutritional quality of food aid programmes for low-income groups; and (6) regulation of marketing of unhealthy foods to children. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, Portugal has a nutrition policy based on the WHO concept of 'health in all policies' and on the national data on food intake. The  implementing process of all 51 actions and the inherent complexities and difficulties found so far have made this process be an authentic political and social laboratory that deserves to be followed.",0
"BACKGROUND: Of the many negative outcomes associated with gestational alcohol use, one that has received relatively little attention is preterm birth and its possible contribution to effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on development. To examine the increased risk for premature delivery associated with PAE and the joint influence of preterm birth and alcohol on child outcomes, analysis was carried out in a longitudinal cohort recruited in Western Ukraine. METHODS: Alcohol-using women and low or nondrinking controls were identified prenatally for a clinical trial of multivitamins and minerals (MVM) in ameliorating effects of PAE. Women were interviewed to provide information about  medical and social status and other drug use. At delivery, information was collected about infant (N = 686) status including gestational age (GA) in weeks.  Finally, 441 infants were followed to 6 months of age and cognitive (Mental Developmental Index [MDI]) and motor development (Psychomotor Developmental Index [PDI]) (measured using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, second Ed (BSID-II). RESULTS: Seven percent infants were born at <37 weeks GA. The odds ratio for preterm delivery for Alcohol Exposed versus Low/No Alcohol was 2.6 (95% Confidence Interval 1.37, 4.94) (p < .003); MVM supplements were associated with  a lower rate of preterm delivery overall, but the relative proportion of preterm  births did not vary by MVM supplement status between alcohol exposure groups. In  mediation models of 6 month cognitive and motor development with reference to Barron and Kenney in 1986, GA significantly mediated alcohol effects (MDI: Z = -2.64, p < .008; PDI: Z = -2.35, p < .02) although PAE independently affected both outcomes (MDI: t = -5.6, p < .000; PDI: t = -3.19, p < .002). CONCLUSION: Results suggest that PAE is associated with higher rates of preterm birth and that alcohol's effect on development in infancy may be both direct and  mediated by shortened length of gestation.",0
"It has been suggested that biological markers are associated with human happiness. We contribute to the empirical literature by examining the independent association between various aspects of biometric wellbeing measured in childhood  and happiness in adulthood. Using Young Finns Study data (n = 1905) and nationally representative linked data we examine whether eight biomarkers measured in childhood (1980) are associated with happiness in adulthood (2001). Using linked data we account for a very rich set of confounders including age, sex, body size, family background, nutritional intake, physical activity, income, education and labour market experiences. We find that there is a negative relationship between triglycerides and subjective well-being but it is both gender- and age-specific and the relationship does not prevail using the later measurements (1983/1986) on triglycerides. In summary, we conclude that none of the eight biomarkers measured in childhood predict happiness robustly in adulthood.",0
"The happiness that comes from a particular success or change in fortune abates with time. The Hedonic Adaptation Prevention (HAP) model specifies two routes by  which the well-being gains derived from a positive life change are eroded--the first involving bottom-up processes (i.e., declining positive emotions generated  by the positive change) and the second involving top-down processes (i.e., increased aspirations for even more positivity). The model also specifies two moderators that can forestall these processes--continued appreciation of the original life change and continued variety in change-related experiences. The authors formally tested the predictions of the HAP model in a 3-month three-wave  longitudinal study of 481 students. Temporal path analyses and moderated regression analyses provided good support for the model. Implications for the stability of well-being, the feasibility of ""the pursuit of happiness,"" and the appeal of overconsumption are discussed.",0
"This study investigated the value of the sense of coherence (SOC), self-esteem, and the Mental Health Inventory subscales as predictors of response to a brief pain management program. One hundred and seven chronic pain patients who participated in a pain management program, which included education about pain, relaxation training, and stress management, were sent a follow-up questionnaire 6 months after the course. Reported pain intensity since the course was significantly associated with SOC subscale meaningfulness. The use of relaxation  and other techniques taught in the course was correlated with positive affect and well-being. The results suggest that health-promoting variables may offer advantages over pathological measures as predictors of patient response to pain management programs, and SOC is worthy of further study.",0
"The use of fear conditioning and extinction paradigms to examine intermediate phenotypes of anxiety and stress-related disorders has facilitated the identification of neurobiological mechanisms that underlie specific components of abnormal psychological functioning. Across species, acute pharmacologic manipulation of the endogenous cannabinoid system has provided evidence of its critical role in fear extinction, but the effects of chronic cannabis on extinction are relatively understudied. In rats, chronic cannabinoid administration impairs fear extinction in a drug-free state. Here we examine whether chronic cannabis use is associated with impaired fear extinction in humans. Participants were healthy chronic cannabis users (n = 20) and nonuser controls with minimal lifetime cannabis use (n = 20) matched on age, sex, and race who all screened negative for psychiatric disorders. A 2-day differential fear conditioning paradigm was used to test the hypothesis that chronic cannabis use would be associated with impaired extinction of the skin conductance response. Consistent with hypotheses, chronic cannabis use was associated with reduced within-session extinction of skin conductance response on Day 1 (d = 0.78), and between-session extinction on Day 2 (d = 0.76). Unexpectedly, cannabis use was also associated with reduced subjective differentiation between threat and safety stimuli during conditioning. Replication and translation of findings are necessary to test potential mechanisms directly and examine whether impairments can be reversed pharmacologically or after a period of cannabis abstinence.

"We conduct a detailed investigation of correlations between real-time expressions of individuals made across the United States and a wide range of emotional, geographic, demographic, and health characteristics. We do so by combining (1) a  massive, geo-tagged data set comprising over 80 million words generated in 2011 on the social network service Twitter and (2) annually-surveyed characteristics of all 50 states and close to 400 urban populations. Among many results, we generate taxonomies of states and cities based on their similarities in word use; estimate the happiness levels of states and cities; correlate highly-resolved demographic characteristics with happiness levels; and connect word choice and message length with urban characteristics such as education levels and obesity rates. Our results show how social media may potentially be used to estimate real-time levels and changes in population-scale measures such as obesity rates.",0
